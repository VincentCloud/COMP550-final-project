53,mass_2021,audience,4.5,p,"fran kranz , previously known _UNKNOWN_ as an actor , tells an _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ in his _UNKNOWN_ debut mass , which could seem _UNKNOWN_ an adapted _UNKNOWN_ to _UNKNOWN_ . six _UNKNOWN_ after a devastating _UNKNOWN_ , the parents of two victims gather in the room of a church to come to terms with the _UNKNOWN_ of that _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ . this results in a _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ chaos between four protagonists , peppered with grief , pain , anger and pure fear . i have often heard that mass is a quiet film . yes , it 's not a sci-fi blockbuster with countless scenarios , dispenses _UNKNOWN_ with any effects and has only four central _UNKNOWN_ . in that respect , it is _UNKNOWN_ a quiet film . but if you define calm by _UNKNOWN_ connection , then mass is probably the spectacle of the _UNKNOWN_ . for what is rehashed and thematised here rips your _UNKNOWN_ out . rarely have i shed so _UNKNOWN_ tears at a film . rarely have all the protagonists grown so close to my _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ their _UNKNOWN_ behaviours . _UNKNOWN_ have _UNKNOWN_ and monologues been so close to my _UNKNOWN_ . this is largely due to franz 's borderline _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ . but in this film it is the actors who make the difference . i have rarely come across such a _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ from an ensemble . all four get _UNKNOWN_ to shine and do so with _UNKNOWN_ bravura . i 'll _UNKNOWN_ with jason isaacs , probably the most recognisable name among the four . his _UNKNOWN_ jay still ca n't believe the incident and death of his son . he tries to understand the psyche of the perpetrator , who turns out to be the son of the other parents . _UNKNOWN_ he tries not to ask too _UNKNOWN_ of them at _UNKNOWN_ , he becomes more and more impatient and angry as _UNKNOWN_ goes on . this _UNKNOWN_ to a _UNKNOWN_ where jay snaps and takes the conversation in a completely _UNKNOWN_ direction . from this point on he is an _UNKNOWN_ wreck . you buy both _UNKNOWN_ states from isaacs through his facial expressions alone . _UNKNOWN_ supporting actor 2022 : jason isaacs , mass . let 's move on to the two mothers , gale ( _UNKNOWN_ plimpton ) and linda ( ann dowd ) . the former is unexpectedly restrained until the last act , before letting her _UNKNOWN_ run free at the end . and in a _UNKNOWN_ that is simply unfathomable . plimpton 's _UNKNOWN_ with isaacs is insanely authentic and if you said they 'd been through this thing in _UNKNOWN_ life , i 'd believe it . ann dowd is _UNKNOWN_ more eloquent in her role and _UNKNOWN_ tries to be the _UNKNOWN_ constant through _UNKNOWN_ . until a _UNKNOWN_ monologue that must win dowd the oscar for _UNKNOWN_ supporting actress . _UNKNOWN_ though she and plimpton give each other _UNKNOWN_ here . if only there were reed birney as the _UNKNOWN_ and proud businessman _UNKNOWN_ . he talks a lot but _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ gets too specific . he is _UNKNOWN_ stiff . _UNKNOWN_ he visibly wants to open up more , he ca n't . this is frustrating to watch , but also could n't be _UNKNOWN_ portrayed . birney also deserves all the praise in the _UNKNOWN_ for his less _UNKNOWN_ but efficient _UNKNOWN_ . so yes , mass is an acting _UNKNOWN_ . one that i have rarely seen in this form and one that will stay with me for a very _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ . it tells a tragic _UNKNOWN_ in such a _UNKNOWN_ manner that you _UNKNOWN_ believe you are _UNKNOWN_ standing in the room listening to the four people on the spot . _UNKNOWN_ has rarely been so tangible and distant for someone who , thank god , has _UNKNOWN_ had to go through _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ this . but at the same _UNKNOWN_ , it 's a film i probably wo n't be able to watch again because of the sheer harshness of its subject matter . moreover , certain _UNKNOWN_ cuts are unnecessary . but no one cares about that ."

176,highlander_2_the_quickening,audience,1.0,n,"after recently _UNKNOWN_ the _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ film ( from 1986 ) and being _UNKNOWN_ with the scottish spirit , i was excited to see where the series would go . i had heard from _UNKNOWN_ sources that _UNKNOWN_ 2 : the quickening was a huge let down from the _UNKNOWN_ and that it was , in fact , a _UNKNOWN_ film . but i _UNKNOWN_ brushed those comments aside because i usually _UNKNOWN_ a _UNKNOWN_ , brainless , _UNKNOWN_ action film from the '80s and '90s . i did n't get my _UNKNOWN_ up at all though _UNKNOWN_ i saw the 0 % _UNKNOWN_ on rotten tomatoes but i thought maybe it might still be at least somewhat _UNKNOWN_ . how wrong i was . not only is this film terribly _UNKNOWN_ from _UNKNOWN_ all perspectives , it 's not _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ to watch in the _UNKNOWN_ . the film is _UNKNOWN_ to the brim with `` _UNKNOWN_ '' _UNKNOWN_ that just _UNKNOWN_ the film seem overly _UNKNOWN_ and the _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ of these _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ did not work _UNKNOWN_ at all with anything else in the film . it _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ the film seem a _UNKNOWN_ cliche and out of date today _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ of the _UNKNOWN_ '90s action flicks also incorporated this _UNKNOWN_ , non-fitting , _UNKNOWN_ , off-beat _UNKNOWN_ relief such as judge dredd in '95 and demolition man in '93 among others . the movie 's _UNKNOWN_ problem though is its infamous multiple plotlines that barely go _UNKNOWN_ at all , most of which are just forgotten and _UNKNOWN_ resolved or mentioned again , _UNKNOWN_ as if the only purpose of _UNKNOWN_ that plotline was to get a fight _UNKNOWN_ or a `` _UNKNOWN_ '' _UNKNOWN_ that just throws the pace of the film off . but , these multiple plotlines do n't just make the film nearly 2 hours , they make the film incomprehensible . _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ in this film , and while there are _UNKNOWN_ things that do n't make _UNKNOWN_ in the '86 film , at least that one resolved its plotlines and had a _UNKNOWN_ charm , which i will get to _UNKNOWN_ . sean connery 's _UNKNOWN_ was completely decapitated in the _UNKNOWN_ film just to pop up randomly in this one without any explanation . the _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ travel plotline was completely ripped from cameron 's '84 _UNKNOWN_ the terminator down to the _UNKNOWN_ and _UNKNOWN_ framing that was used . the _UNKNOWN_ plotlines also lead to _UNKNOWN_ consistency errors that would take all day to list . the plotlines just make a massive blob and _UNKNOWN_ of a film that clearly was just a bunch of people throwing _UNKNOWN_ ideas _UNKNOWN_ came to mind into the script . the _UNKNOWN_ plotline is n't _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ or intriguing at all ( this is the ridiculous ozone layer plotline for those who ca n't tell due to the hundreds of plotlines in this film ) . i just felt that with all these plots , there was so _UNKNOWN_ that could have been cut out to shorten the _UNKNOWN_ and just make the film easier to follow and more _UNKNOWN_ to watch . i kept catching myself saying `` that could be cut out '' which does n't lead to a _UNKNOWN_ film . some smaller problems with the film would be that in some _UNKNOWN_ the _UNKNOWN_ did n't fit at all , _UNKNOWN_ the _UNKNOWN_ train _UNKNOWN_ . the set was very generic-looking for an '80s-'90s sci-fi _UNKNOWN_ film and compared to some others , _UNKNOWN_ '90 's total recall , looks _UNKNOWN_ and _UNKNOWN_ . the costumes were also very bulky and ridiculous and i would expect that from a film _UNKNOWN_ this from this _UNKNOWN_ but this was _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ . some of the editing was also very _UNKNOWN_ and terribly structured . there were _UNKNOWN_ too _UNKNOWN_ cuts in certain _UNKNOWN_ , specifically the _UNKNOWN_ train _UNKNOWN_ , and in some of the fighting sequences the actors were out of frame _UNKNOWN_ the audience from seeing the action . also , there were _UNKNOWN_ too _UNKNOWN_ explosions . there seemed to be an explosion _UNKNOWN_ two seconds and it just got very _UNKNOWN_ and _UNKNOWN_ after a while . what _UNKNOWN_ this film _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ is that it takes _UNKNOWN_ of the mysterious things that _UNKNOWN_ the '86 movie _UNKNOWN_ and _UNKNOWN_ and just completely abuses them and takes their charm _UNKNOWN_ . _UNKNOWN_ thing this movie lacks is the charm of the _UNKNOWN_ . i missed the _UNKNOWN_ between connery and lambert , the bagpipe _UNKNOWN_ ( which _UNKNOWN_ an appearance in this film [ the quickening ] and is , as said above , misused and does n't fit _UNKNOWN_ aside from reminding us of the _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ and _UNKNOWN_ of scotland in the '86 movie ) , the _UNKNOWN_ which was _UNKNOWN_ impressive for an '80s action film i must say , and just _UNKNOWN_ that _UNKNOWN_ the _UNKNOWN_ installment _UNKNOWN_ , _UNKNOWN_ , and _UNKNOWN_ . the acting was also not _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ from ironside who seemed to be trying _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ to be an _UNKNOWN_ jack nicholson ( failing _UNKNOWN_ , sadly ) . lambert was ok in this film , he gives a _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ in the '86 one and so does connery . connery was one of the few things i _UNKNOWN_ about this movie , he _UNKNOWN_ did bring the mood up and the few _UNKNOWN_ he shared with lambert ( and the suit tailoring _UNKNOWN_ ) were _UNKNOWN_ and _UNKNOWN_ , but other than that he seems to be completely _UNKNOWN_ in this movie . the only other positive thing i have to say about this film is that in the opening sequence there was some _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ movement , sweeping across the _UNKNOWN_ house but again , it just seemed to drag on and extend the _UNKNOWN_ . in a word , the _UNKNOWN_ and shortest _UNKNOWN_ to describe the horrendous _UNKNOWN_ of _UNKNOWN_ that is _UNKNOWN_ 2 : the quickening is ... _UNKNOWN_ ."

178,highlander_2_the_quickening,audience,1.5,n,"_UNKNOWN_ 2 : the quickening is a name so ridiculous that it serves as a _UNKNOWN_ metaphor for the film itself . i seen the _UNKNOWN_ not so _UNKNOWN_ ago , and while i was n't blown _UNKNOWN_ by it , i still found myself engaging with its _UNKNOWN_ and _UNKNOWN_ its occasionally wacky _UNKNOWN_ . the follow up seems to go out of its _UNKNOWN_ to ruin anything _UNKNOWN_ about its predecessor , and _UNKNOWN_ taint _UNKNOWN_ legacy it had . it _UNKNOWN_ off by retconning the origin of the immortals , then _UNKNOWN_ the ending of the _UNKNOWN_ film , then introduces some corporate _UNKNOWN_ plotline that _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ it was lifted from _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ sci-fi flick and carelessly dropped into this one . the _UNKNOWN_ is a spectacular _UNKNOWN_ , the _UNKNOWN_ have unconvincing motivations , the script is _UNKNOWN_ and the acting ranges from bored hayden christensen to sugar rush nicholas _UNKNOWN_ . the film is so confused and disordered that _UNKNOWN_ 20 _UNKNOWN_ could _UNKNOWN_ have been written and directed by a _UNKNOWN_ person . the villains were my favourite element by far . not because they 're _UNKNOWN_ or intimidating , but because of the sheer volume of _UNKNOWN_ they get to chew . michael ironside , who know from the _UNKNOWN_ that the movie was going to suck , takes _UNKNOWN_ opportunity to bare his shiny teeth and mug to the _UNKNOWN_ , and i was _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ all of his _UNKNOWN_ . he 's _UNKNOWN_ to the extreme , and john c. mcginley , doing a weak orson _UNKNOWN_ impression , is not _UNKNOWN_ as _UNKNOWN_ , but occasionally gets _UNKNOWN_ close . i ca n't say i was bored while _UNKNOWN_ it , and the movie does pass by very quickly , possibly because of how baffled i was by it all . at the end of the day , there 's _UNKNOWN_ , _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ out there , but it 's still a film that nobody _UNKNOWN_ wanted to be in , _UNKNOWN_ when it was re-written , and it 's _UNKNOWN_ been confined to the ‘ _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ of all _UNKNOWN_ ' pile , where it more than deserves to be . if you 're a ‘ so _UNKNOWN_ its _UNKNOWN_ ' afficionado , _UNKNOWN_ 2 : the quickening is an absolute must see ."

113,zoom_2006,audience,0.5,n,"_UNKNOWN_ are usually meant for an _UNKNOWN_ audience . but aiming for a _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ crowd , can be achieved , under the right circumstances . in fact , take a look at 2004 's `` the _UNKNOWN_ '' , a _UNKNOWN_ feature that caters to both adults and kids at the same _UNKNOWN_ . naturally , _UNKNOWN_ other studios wanted to cash in on this type of success , and thus , sony tried their _UNKNOWN_ to make a _UNKNOWN_ feature called `` _UNKNOWN_ '' in the _UNKNOWN_ 2006. the key word being tried . because , what ultimately happened was that this movie _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ , both at the box office , and with the critics . is this statement _UNKNOWN_ ? why , yes , yes it is . `` _UNKNOWN_ '' is an absolute failure from _UNKNOWN_ to finish . from _UNKNOWN_ acting , _UNKNOWN_ pacing , and _UNKNOWN_ of all , a _UNKNOWN_ script that is based on a book , `` _UNKNOWN_ '' does n't work in any kind of _UNKNOWN_ . there is _UNKNOWN_ redeemable that _UNKNOWN_ it _UNKNOWN_ ; this is easily one of the _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ of all _UNKNOWN_ . _UNKNOWN_ sony was thinking to turn this into a franchise , `` _UNKNOWN_ '' just was n't it . the _UNKNOWN_ follows a group of kids that are recruited to a secret military base in order to become _UNKNOWN_ . these include two _UNKNOWN_ dylan and summer ( michael cassidy and kate mara respectively ) , and two children tucker and cindy ( spencer breslin and ryan _UNKNOWN_ respectively ) . _UNKNOWN_ , this _UNKNOWN_ are being trained under the _UNKNOWN_ of a former _UNKNOWN_ : captain _UNKNOWN_ ( tim allen ) . unfortunately , _UNKNOWN_ does n't want to do this , and wants to live his own life . as _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ goes on , _UNKNOWN_ must find _UNKNOWN_ in order to make peace with these kids , as _UNKNOWN_ as to be a _UNKNOWN_ of a team once more . and in doing so , they must _UNKNOWN_ an _UNKNOWN_ villain from _UNKNOWN_ 's past before he breaks havoc onto the _UNKNOWN_ once more . `` _UNKNOWN_ '' is a _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ film . and here 's why . the acting is _UNKNOWN_ . not only just from allen , who acts _UNKNOWN_ he does n't want to be here , but from all the other major _UNKNOWN_ that are present in this production . in the movie , we also have access to _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ from rip torn , courtney cox , and _UNKNOWN_ chevy chase , just to name a few . the kid actors are all right , as are the _UNKNOWN_ actors , but nobody turns out a decent _UNKNOWN_ , as they _UNKNOWN_ do n't seem to care whether or not they are here on the set or not . this can contributed to the direction from peter hewitt . it _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ there is no _UNKNOWN_ of direction from him , as all the actors either do not care , or just do _UNKNOWN_ they _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ . and this was n't the _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ peter was behind the _UNKNOWN_ 's chair , but it nearly looks _UNKNOWN_ this was going to be his last . next , we have the _UNKNOWN_ . it 's _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ non-existent . what i mean by this is that while the _UNKNOWN_ orchestrated _UNKNOWN_ by _UNKNOWN_ beck , it 's mostly pushed over to the side by a pop _UNKNOWN_ . oh , and most of the songs in _UNKNOWN_ are done by _UNKNOWN_ band smash mouth , because that worked so _UNKNOWN_ with 2001 's `` shrek '' . and _UNKNOWN_ when the orchestration is being delivered , it 's not that _UNKNOWN_ . for instance , there should have been a lot more action _UNKNOWN_ , but _UNKNOWN_ , we get more of a _UNKNOWN_ tone delivered . what were they thinking ? the costumes and set design is also generic and _UNKNOWN_ . it 's your typical lab coats and same matching outfits . _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ stands out . but the _UNKNOWN_ crime that the movie serves up is with its _UNKNOWN_ and writing . the _UNKNOWN_ combines a lot of other _UNKNOWN_ origins from other _UNKNOWN_ , i.e . x-men and _UNKNOWN_ four for example , and it just does n't work . there are a lot of plot holes , not a lot of _UNKNOWN_ development , and _UNKNOWN_ , no major buildup to the _UNKNOWN_ confrontation with the _UNKNOWN_ villain . as for the writing , it 's formulaic , predictable , and _UNKNOWN_ not _UNKNOWN_ . the _UNKNOWN_ purpose of a _UNKNOWN_ , is to be _UNKNOWN_ , but here , it _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ all of the _UNKNOWN_ is sucked out , and replaced with _UNKNOWN_ . the editing and pacing can be a _UNKNOWN_ deal breaker here . at roughly 90 _UNKNOWN_ , the film moves at rather fast pace , and there is no _UNKNOWN_ for the movie to slow down or take a break . if the movie could have added a couple of extra _UNKNOWN_ and taken its _UNKNOWN_ , then we would n't have the _UNKNOWN_ that was produced . the editing _UNKNOWN_ a huge factor in this as _UNKNOWN_ . _UNKNOWN_ moves irregularly , and there are _UNKNOWN_ when the editing just wants to do _UNKNOWN_ it wants . that just _UNKNOWN_ this film _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ . but the sad _UNKNOWN_ is that this could have worked . _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ could have worked out , and what we would have gotten , would be _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ . given the right direction and script , this would have turned out _UNKNOWN_ . but as it is , `` _UNKNOWN_ '' is a _UNKNOWN_ and _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ film that tries is _UNKNOWN_ to appeal to the _UNKNOWN_ demographic , _UNKNOWN_ ultimately earns its place in the bargain bin ."

there _UNKNOWN_ ca n't be anybody that _UNKNOWN_ expected that . i know for _UNKNOWN_ that i did n't expect any of that from this flick . i know i 've _UNKNOWN_ been a person who , at least , tries to go into _UNKNOWN_ with an open mind . yes , i _UNKNOWN_ believe i went into jack and jill and grown ups 2 with an open mind . i think a lot of people expect to go in wanting to hate those _UNKNOWN_ , but i do n't . i want to _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ . why would i want to watch a movie that is gon na make me want to pull my hair out and make want to go on a crime spree ? i do n't wan na watch _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ that . when i watch a movie , as _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ as there is for that _UNKNOWN_ film being any _UNKNOWN_ , i want to _UNKNOWN_ it . i do n't want to hate it . this is one of those _UNKNOWN_ for which there was _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ of it being any _UNKNOWN_ . that 's just the _UNKNOWN_ it is . a janitor , who 's lost his memory , thinking he 's a secret _UNKNOWN_ spy , who finds himself in the middle of this conspiracy involving some computer chip . how _UNKNOWN_ do you think you can draw from this premise ? then again , i suppose with a _UNKNOWN_ writer , you can get _UNKNOWN_ out of anything , right ? where do i begin with this movie ? i suppose let 's _UNKNOWN_ with its star , cedric the entertainer . i 'm _UNKNOWN_ cedric is a very _UNKNOWN_ man and i 'm _UNKNOWN_ if , he 's given the right project , he can be an _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ actor . i think his work in barbershop speaks for itself . but he 's just _UNKNOWN_ obnoxious in this movie . and not the type of obnoxious that kevin _UNKNOWN_ is _UNKNOWN_ to be in , say , ride _UNKNOWN_ , where he 's still sort of endearing , in a _UNKNOWN_ . i think that concept can work and it did work with the _UNKNOWN_ ride _UNKNOWN_ . i 'm not saying that it 's a _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ , but the dynamic of kevin _UNKNOWN_ being a tiny , _UNKNOWN_ man versus ice cube 's rough demeanor worked very _UNKNOWN_ . you do n't have that dynamic here , cedric does n't _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ off of anyone , _UNKNOWN_ , at least until lucy liu comes into the equation . and _UNKNOWN_ then , it 's still all about cedric and not _UNKNOWN_ necessarily the dynamic of his _UNKNOWN_ with lucy . i 'll be _UNKNOWN_ honest , i found cedric to be completely _UNKNOWN_ here . i suppose that would have been clear when i said the _UNKNOWN_ was _UNKNOWN_ , but _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ can still be _UNKNOWN_ if they 're _UNKNOWN_ and/or the actor portraying the _UNKNOWN_ does a _UNKNOWN_ job . look at adam devine 's _UNKNOWN_ filmography . this guy has _UNKNOWN_ a career out of _UNKNOWN_ assholes that you just wan na punch in the _UNKNOWN_ , but he 's very _UNKNOWN_ at it . then again , devine 's _UNKNOWN_ are _UNKNOWN_ to be that _UNKNOWN_ . i do n't think cedric 's _UNKNOWN_ , in this flick , was meant to be _UNKNOWN_ . i 'm assuming they were going for someone that anyone could relate to . let me tell you right now that they missed the mark completely . jake , the janitor , is _UNKNOWN_ infuriating when he _UNKNOWN_ acting _UNKNOWN_ a condescending dick to his 'girlfriend ' gina , who 's undercover as a waitress . jake _UNKNOWN_ acting as if her occupation as a waitress prohibits her from understanding how serious his job as a 'spy ' is . he acted _UNKNOWN_ such a fucking dick to her . but that 's not _UNKNOWN_ nearly the _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ . the _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ of this is , and this is the _UNKNOWN_ thing this type of flick can be , the fact that it 's completely _UNKNOWN_ . i get that this is not the type of premise that you can get a lot of _UNKNOWN_ from , but you wo n't know unless you try . they did not make any attempt _UNKNOWN_ to make this an _UNKNOWN_ movie . they relied on _UNKNOWN_ and tired sitcom-y concepts and _UNKNOWN_ . i 'm not saying that _UNKNOWN_ ca n't work in a _UNKNOWN_ film , but you got ta know how to properly build to it . jackie chan 's works , at least his earlier _UNKNOWN_ , relied as _UNKNOWN_ on _UNKNOWN_ ( inspired by silent film comedians ) as _UNKNOWN_ as it did on his _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ ability . he was able to combine the two to create a _UNKNOWN_ and _UNKNOWN_ style . this movie uses _UNKNOWN_ because their script is shit and they needed _UNKNOWN_ to put in trailers . this _UNKNOWN_ is that _UNKNOWN_ of a movie . it would 've gotten half a star if it was n't for the fact that _UNKNOWN_ davis and niecy nash _UNKNOWN_ me chuckle a couple of _UNKNOWN_ . more the latter than the former , but i 'll take the positives where i can find them . this is the type of film that destroys careers . why do you think that cedric the entertainer has n't received any major starring roles in _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ this ? he also starred in the honeymooners ( which was released two _UNKNOWN_ prior to this one and was also a critical and commercial failure ) . lucy liu 's career was on the downslide at this point _UNKNOWN_ , but this movie certainly did her no favors . lucy and cedric have continued to get work , of course , as supporting _UNKNOWN_ , voice over _UNKNOWN_ and other assorted tv roles . so it 's obviously not a complete career destroyer , but it certainly halted cedric 's transition to a major _UNKNOWN_ film star . and i ca n't say that i 'm sad about that . cedric just did a shitty job in this movie . he was _UNKNOWN_ and he was n't very _UNKNOWN_ . _UNKNOWN_ of that might not be his fault , in that he was scripted to be this _UNKNOWN_ , but a _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ actor can take shitty material and , at least , elevate it somewhat . and i do n't mean elevate to _UNKNOWN_ , because that was _UNKNOWN_ gon na happen , but i mean elevate it to where it 's at least fine to watch . cedric _UNKNOWN_ monumentally at elevating this to 'just fine ' status . perhaps i 'm putting too _UNKNOWN_ responsibility on his shoulders , but this movie still sucked no matter who was to _UNKNOWN_ . this was _UNKNOWN_ and no one should watch this under any circumstances ."

149,stratton,audience,1.5,n,"stratton has to be one of the most generic and _UNKNOWN_ spy thrillers i 've seen , but i 'm getting ahead of myself . similar to james bond , john stratton is a _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ in a series of spy thriller novels and this movie is based on that _UNKNOWN_ ( i 'm not _UNKNOWN_ if this film is based off a _UNKNOWN_ book in the series or not ) . in this movie , stratton and his _UNKNOWN_ are sent in to destroy a facility containing a deadly biological weapon , but things go awry when key intel is wrong and all the scientists and guards are already dead . terrorists are waiting to ambush them and the deadly chemical `` satan 's snow '' is already gone . now , it 's up to stratton to figure out what the terrorist are planning to attack with this biological weapon and try to _UNKNOWN_ them before it is too late . this is normally the type of movie i would n't bother _UNKNOWN_ . it seemed _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ that would either go straight to dvd or you might find in a bargain bin , but i was looking from some _UNKNOWN_ that hand january 2018 us release dates and i noticed a few names i recognized in the film . i would n't call them a-list _UNKNOWN_ , but dominic cooper , tom felton , and thomas kretschmann are actors i recognize and have _UNKNOWN_ in sole roles . i did n't _UNKNOWN_ until after the movie that it was directed by simon west who directed such _UNKNOWN_ as : con air , lara croft : tomb raider , when a stranger calls ( 2006 ) , the mechanic , the expendables 2 , and the rick astley _UNKNOWN_ video `` _UNKNOWN_ gon na give you up '' . there are at least a few _UNKNOWN_ things i can say about the movie . for one , i do _UNKNOWN_ thomas kretschmann 's _UNKNOWN_ as the _UNKNOWN_ villain in the film : grigory barovsky . kretschmann is a _UNKNOWN_ actor i respect , _UNKNOWN_ if it might be in more _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ than _UNKNOWN_ ones . he _UNKNOWN_ a _UNKNOWN_ villain for the film and the villain himself is the most _UNKNOWN_ and formidable _UNKNOWN_ . this is one of those cases where a _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ villain is _UNKNOWN_ on a _UNKNOWN_ movie . i found that by the third act came around ; the film was more bearable to sit through . i would n't consider the action anything special at the end , but at least it was more acceptable compared to the _UNKNOWN_ couple of action sequences in the film . the third act of the film _UNKNOWN_ picked up , it 's just a shame that it felt _UNKNOWN_ a slog to get to that point . i also _UNKNOWN_ the opening theme of the movie . the _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ you might find in a james bond film . for reference , i 'm talking about the _UNKNOWN_ that 's _UNKNOWN_ when the studio logos are being shown . the next bit of _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ during the opening credits is _UNKNOWN_ catchy as _UNKNOWN_ ; _UNKNOWN_ if it was being _UNKNOWN_ over clips _UNKNOWN_ looked more _UNKNOWN_ a dvd title _UNKNOWN_ rather than opening credits . unfortunately , the rest of the _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ or _UNKNOWN_ in the film is _UNKNOWN_ and _UNKNOWN_ . _UNKNOWN_ else about this film was _UNKNOWN_ , _UNKNOWN_ , predictable , _UNKNOWN_ , or _UNKNOWN_ executed . when the opening mission _UNKNOWN_ , i was positive stratton 's _UNKNOWN_ would die on the mission . _UNKNOWN_ about how the _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ out and how the two of them _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ the _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ more than an extra that _UNKNOWN_ dies on these missions . i was surprised he was n't chopped to bits in the pipe they had to swim through . _UNKNOWN_ , the movie had him die at the very end of the opening mission and tried to get us to care about his death . he felt _UNKNOWN_ he was _UNKNOWN_ more than an extra in the film , and _UNKNOWN_ the film wants you to be extremely sad or angry about his death , because apparently stratton and him had a _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ of being buddies and _UNKNOWN_ . i just found it incredibly _UNKNOWN_ when it cut to the escape helicopter rising up and stratton hammering his fist into his _UNKNOWN_ 's chest . stratton karate chopping his dead _UNKNOWN_ 's neck and then screaming in his _UNKNOWN_ `` wake up , _UNKNOWN_ ! '' was just the cherry on a _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ . stratton 's _UNKNOWN_ is n't the only _UNKNOWN_ lacking the _UNKNOWN_ development needed for us to care . practically _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ , including our _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ stratton , is _UNKNOWN_ and has _UNKNOWN_ to them that helps us care in the _UNKNOWN_ . we learn virtually _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ about stratton or who he is as a _UNKNOWN_ . so , clearly this movie is n't a _UNKNOWN_ driven _UNKNOWN_ or a _UNKNOWN_ study . the movie focuses on the plot and _UNKNOWN_ that will be engaging _UNKNOWN_ . _UNKNOWN_ , the plot is far too predictable and generic . it also does n't help that _UNKNOWN_ are film in such a _UNKNOWN_ and _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ . it 's _UNKNOWN_ impossible to find the plot engaging . the only _UNKNOWN_ the plot is remotely _UNKNOWN_ is the _UNKNOWN_ act of the film . the shootout at the beginning mission has too _UNKNOWN_ jump cuts that it felt chaotic to watch . the car chase after the shootout had to be one of the slowest car chases i 've seen on film that is n't meant to be a parody . if it was n't for the _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ of stratton trying to revive his dead _UNKNOWN_ , i might have shut off the film and not bothered _UNKNOWN_ it . as you can probably imagine , there is some _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ in the film , _UNKNOWN_ the `` banter '' stratton has with his _UNKNOWN_ at the beginning of the film . the acting is mostly phoned in or _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ . one _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ has to be from gemma chan who _UNKNOWN_ aggy in the film . gemma chan is _UNKNOWN_ in crazy rich asians , but i imagine she had _UNKNOWN_ to work with in this role . she 's so robotic and _UNKNOWN_ in this film . i might go so far as to say she had the _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ in this film . i _UNKNOWN_ do n't think there is any reason to see this film , _UNKNOWN_ when there are far _UNKNOWN_ action _UNKNOWN_ and spy _UNKNOWN_ out there . it might not one of the _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ i 've seen this _UNKNOWN_ , but it 's _UNKNOWN_ going to be among one of the most _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ of 2018 for me . _UNKNOWN_ : 1 acting : 1 _UNKNOWN_ : 0.5 _UNKNOWN_ : 1 _UNKNOWN_ : 1.25 _UNKNOWN_ effects : 2 editing : 1.5 _UNKNOWN_ : 1.5 directing : 2 action : 1.5 thriller : 1 critical _UNKNOWN_ : 1.30 _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ : 1.25 _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ : 1.28"

58,playing_for_keeps_2012,audience,0.5,n,"_UNKNOWN_ for keeps is a _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ movie to _UNKNOWN_ . i tried to find one positive thing to say about the film , and i came up empty . i can imagine _UNKNOWN_ rom-com fans will have a _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ liking this film , as i 'm _UNKNOWN_ they have seen _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ ones . the acting is serviceable , which is the _UNKNOWN_ praise i can give to this film . _UNKNOWN_ for keeps _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ butler , jessica biel , dennis quaid , judy greer , catherine zeta-jones , and uma thurman . not a _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ . you 're not going to think any of them are _UNKNOWN_ actors/actresses ( _UNKNOWN_ the child actor was _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ ) , but they 're not _UNKNOWN_ doing their _UNKNOWN_ , and the _UNKNOWN_ between biel and butler is n't that _UNKNOWN_ . the problem with this movie is that it 's very _UNKNOWN_ . _UNKNOWN_ for keeps was directed by gabriele muccino , _UNKNOWN_ of the pursuit of happyness and _UNKNOWN_ pounds , both decent _UNKNOWN_ that starred will smith . though they were both very _UNKNOWN_ , at least the movie earned some of the _UNKNOWN_ . _UNKNOWN_ for keeps does not because the lead _UNKNOWN_ is n't relatable . he 's a former football _UNKNOWN_ ( as a british person , the word soccer does n't exist ) who 's down on his luck , but seemingly gets _UNKNOWN_ handed to him when he becomes a children 's football coach , such as a job as a sports anchor and a ferrari just because he 's friends with dennis quaid . kids _UNKNOWN_ him , women want to have sex with him , men want to be him , and it 's one of the most self-aggrandizing _UNKNOWN_ of shit i 've _UNKNOWN_ seen ( with butler also serving as a producer ) . dennis quaid was _UNKNOWN_ and _UNKNOWN_ . he _UNKNOWN_ a supporting role as a rich , unfaithful businessman who bribes george ( _UNKNOWN_ butler ) with what looks _UNKNOWN_ a thousand dollars ( my estimate might be wrong ) so that his son can be goalkeeper and his daughter can sing the national anthem . why is that so _UNKNOWN_ to him ? and his admiration for george just felt _UNKNOWN_ . the women in the movie are idiots , with uma thurman being the _UNKNOWN_ idiot of them all , and her shrillness _UNKNOWN_ her _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ irritating . not that george is any _UNKNOWN_ because he lets his child drive a ferrari on the road at what looks _UNKNOWN_ 60mph . the women are idiots for _UNKNOWN_ purposes , but i only _UNKNOWN_ once . the tone was also inconsistent . it 's a _UNKNOWN_ and _UNKNOWN_ crude rom-com in one _UNKNOWN_ and a mawkishly _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ in _UNKNOWN_ . _UNKNOWN_ for keeps is a very basic rom-com where _UNKNOWN_ butler tries to be more responsible and rekindle his _UNKNOWN_ with his son and ex-wife . of course , his ex-wife takes him _UNKNOWN_ in the end because the movie did n't _UNKNOWN_ try to give her fiance a _UNKNOWN_ . he does _UNKNOWN_ other than open the door and greet _UNKNOWN_ butler . there is n't _UNKNOWN_ a subplot where he 's suspicious that jessica biel might be cheating on him . _UNKNOWN_ for keeps is a _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ film , which _UNKNOWN_ right into _UNKNOWN_ butler 's wheelhouse ( i have _UNKNOWN_ to see a _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ butler movie ) , but it 's sad to see gabriele muccino sink this low . _UNKNOWN_ for keeps is a _UNKNOWN_ rom-com that 's on par with gigli , and we all know what happened to _UNKNOWN_ brest after that film . muccino 's career is probably dead now because of this film , as his latest film ( fathers & daughters ) was a critical and commercial failure . _UNKNOWN_ , i saw this film on youtube as no one cares _UNKNOWN_ about the film to take it down and it helped me fall asleep . so the next _UNKNOWN_ i need help falling asleep ( because i do get insomnia ) , i 'll just watch this film again on youtube ."

espectador queda desconcertado y algo cansado . por todo lo que antecede yo creo que es conveniente ver esta película luego de haber visto `` mon oncle '' y `` trafic '' . y armarse además de paciencia y saber que será un visionado que requiere descansos , rebobinados y algo de reflexión . lo _UNKNOWN_ , la confusión y la ingenuidad . eterno `` leitmotiv '' del señor hulot la automatización de la vida _UNKNOWN_ que le impide comprenderla , insertarse en ella e _UNKNOWN_ con el prójimo , aquí también se extiende al resto de los personajes . todos ellos , desde los que _UNKNOWN_ en el aeropuerto , los turistas que son acarreados para distintos hoteles o paseos de acuerdo a la letra de su apellido , hasta una increíble fauna de comensales y _UNKNOWN_ de servicio en la larguísima secuencia del restaurante de lujo que se inaugura sin haber terminado las obras de construcción del mismo , no encajan , no se acomodan , andan por el mundo como monsieur hulot —incluso hay tres o cuatro dobles de este personaje— tratando de encontrar su lugar en el mundo . los turistas que visitan paris ven los íconos famosos de la ciudad luz _UNKNOWN_ en los reflejos de las _UNKNOWN_ ( torre eiffel , arco de triunfo ) . además en su deambular por las calles y los comercios están rodeados de afiches turísticos que promocionan otros lugares ( grecia , italia , españa ) pero todos ellos tienen la misma fotografía : un edificio todo metal y _UNKNOWN_ que , a su vez , está presente una y otra vez en frente mismo a ellos . van todos como las ovejas en el rebaño y , por ejemplo , en una pista de baile con dimensiones para 6 o 7 parejas se ponen a bailar más de cincuenta personas . una orquesta en vivo de jazz , interpretando un tema de ritmo africano , hace que el desenfreno de la danza de esa multitud debe verse repetidas veces no solo para volver a disfrutarla , sino también para descubrir infinidad de _UNKNOWN_ que son imperceptibles porque ocurren simultáneamente . es prácticamente imposible imaginar cómo habrán sido los ensayos para mover a esa cantidad de extras con tanta precisión , con tanto garbo y con la desopilante consecuencia de esa enorme _UNKNOWN_ . de entre _UNKNOWN_ , se destaca una escena en la que un anciano portero debe lidiar con un gigantesco panel electrónico para anunciar a una oficina la llegada de un cliente . que las instrucciones estén escritas en un idioma desconocido para este pobre hombre es un detalle _UNKNOWN_ que hace que la secuencia se antológica . la secuencia _UNKNOWN_ en un enorme carrusel ( tiovivo ) conformado por decenas de vehículos que dan vueltas alrededor de una especie de obelisco muestra algo así como una alegoría de que no todo está perdido : aparecen por _UNKNOWN_ vez los niños arrojando globos que dan un colorido _UNKNOWN_ a una estupenda fotografía previa de tonos apagados , ocres y nocturnos . capitalismo , burgueses y trabajadores . el tono _UNKNOWN_ es una sutil pero , a la vez , feroz crítica al progreso y al `` stablishment '' . por un lado la descripción de productos de consumo masivo ridículos e inútiles . sillas y sillones que vuelven a su estado _UNKNOWN_ cuando uno se pone de pie , escobas con faroles que permiten iluminar debajo de una mesa cuando se está barriendo , puertas insonoras diseñadas para dar portazos silenciosos , _UNKNOWN_ . los dueños de empresas , _UNKNOWN_ , usuarios de gran poder económico que se visten todos iguales de punta en blanco para la ocasión , en la inauguración de un restaurante 5 tenedores que aún no terminó sus obras . son quienes miran con desprecio al resto de los _UNKNOWN_ , a los turistas de viajes económicos , a los borrachos callejeros y que tratan a sus empleados como perros . pero , como siempre , son los laburantes quienes tienen el peso de hacer _UNKNOWN_ las cosas . son los meseros quienes sirven y sientan a los comensales en sus mesas , los cocineros y barmans quienes proveen las comidas y las bebidas , e incluso los porteros que abren y cierran puertas de vidrio que ya no existen porque fueron destruidas por hulot . estos trabajadores no van a restaurantes de lujo , van a pequeños lugares de comida rápida y prefieren los sándwiches de pan francés , vino suelto y alguna cerveza en lata . en la debacle de la inauguración del restaurante queda bien claro que los grupos de turistas de paquetes económicos tienen horas distintas al resto para usar sus instalaciones , _UNKNOWN_ o muy temprano o tan tarde que ya uno no tiene ganas de comer . _UNKNOWN_ de nosotros que haya viajado en excursión sabe de todo esto . la _UNKNOWN_ y la geometría . sobre este tema hay profuso material escrito en internet . en varias facultades de _UNKNOWN_ ( brasil , francia , bélgica ) se estudian los decorados y las construcciones de _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ . en la producción de esta película hubo una estrecha colaboración de _UNKNOWN_ con tati para la construcción del set . las líneas de fuga en los edificios , el diseño en un enorme complejo de oficinas dispuestas en cabinas que , aún cuando están contiguas , se comunican por teléfono para pasarse información que está archivada en la propia cabina desde la cual se piden los datos . pisos relucientes ( y muy ruidosos al transitarlos ) , enormes ventanales que permiten el uso de luz natural pero que a la vez carecen de intimidad porque desde las veredas puede verse todo lo que ocurre puertas adentro . no sólo en los edificios comerciales , también en los rascacielos que alojan los _UNKNOWN_ donde vive la gente y cuya vida interior transcurre como detrás de grandes _UNKNOWN_ . en fin , una _UNKNOWN_ del séptimo _UNKNOWN_ sobre la cual se ha escrito _UNKNOWN_ . tal vez demasiado , incluyendo estas pobres líneas mías que bien podrían ser eliminadas . se trata de un filme que merece la pena hacer el esfuerzo intelectual y de atención para disfrutarla . estoy tentado de decir para espectadores inteligentes pero no lo hago porque eso sería menospreciar al prójimo ... cosa que nunca hizo jacques tati"

'' _UNKNOWN_ other public critics seemed to genuinely _UNKNOWN_ the film stating that it _UNKNOWN_ them _UNKNOWN_ and smile . the film began when morton schmidt ( jonah hill ) and greg jenko ( channing tatum ) went to _UNKNOWN_ school with each other . jenko was an athletic jock who picked on schmidt who was a nerdy introvert . _UNKNOWN_ after _UNKNOWN_ school , jenko and schmidt attended the same police academy in which was when their friendship blossomed when they decided to help each other 's weaknesses . schmidt agreed to help jenko with his studies while jenko promised schmidt to help with his physical strength . after graduating from the police academy , the two _UNKNOWN_ cops are assigned a specialty division on 21 jump street . they are introduced to captain dickinson ( ice cube ) who explains their _UNKNOWN_ undercover mission as _UNKNOWN_ school students is to _UNKNOWN_ the _UNKNOWN_ synthetic drug from spreading to other campuses by finding the supplier . schmidt and jenko figure out that eric , who is _UNKNOWN_ by dave franco , is the lead dealer of the school , _UNKNOWN_ , he is not the supplier . schmidt _UNKNOWN_ to become close to eric and his popular friend group to find out who is giving eric the drugs , while jenko becomes friends with the `` nerds '' in his ap _UNKNOWN_ class . he discovers that his _UNKNOWN_ friends can hack into people 's phones , and jenko asks them to hack into eric 's phone . schmidt has a plan to throw a huge _UNKNOWN_ at his parent 's house while they were _UNKNOWN_ on vacation to gain eric 's trust . meanwhile , jenko steals eric 's phone from his _UNKNOWN_ pocket and gives it to his ap _UNKNOWN_ friends so they can hack into it and find out who the supplier is . after gaining eric 's trust , eric tells schmidt that the drug deal is happening during prom . both schmidt and jenko have to be careful during the drug bust so they do not blow their cover . during the prom , they find out who the drug supplier is and _UNKNOWN_ the spread of the synthetic drug . i honestly _UNKNOWN_ this movie and i give it a 5/5 ( 0 being a _UNKNOWN_ film , 5 is a _UNKNOWN_ film ) . i was upset the other _UNKNOWN_ and i wanted to put on a _UNKNOWN_ action movie to make me _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ , and this movie put a smile on my _UNKNOWN_ . immediately after _UNKNOWN_ 21 jump street , i _UNKNOWN_ the sequel , 22 jump street . i thought that channing tatum and jonah hill gave an _UNKNOWN_ and _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ which _UNKNOWN_ me _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ . their connection _UNKNOWN_ was remarkable and you can tell that they got _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ as _UNKNOWN_ . i thought it was ironic how the _UNKNOWN_ jonah hill _UNKNOWN_ was a cop and did not know how to use a gun and channing tatum 's _UNKNOWN_ who was also a cop did not know his miranda rights . i would _UNKNOWN_ this movie to an audience who _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ and action _UNKNOWN_ over the _UNKNOWN_ of 18. the movie does have sex _UNKNOWN_ and violence which needs parental permission for kids . this movie also does have some _UNKNOWN_ jokes which could rub off or offend some audience . _UNKNOWN_ , this film was _UNKNOWN_ produced , had _UNKNOWN_ songs , and _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ actors who would pop up _UNKNOWN_ the film ."

117,green_lantern,audience,1.5,n,"green lantern is a complete disaster , with _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ aspect falling _UNKNOWN_ on its _UNKNOWN_ . the most prominent dilemma with the movie is its _UNKNOWN_ script . the _UNKNOWN_ plot is difficult to follow and does not flow right . parallax 's _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ so taken _UNKNOWN_ by hector hammond 's _UNKNOWN_ , with both being _UNKNOWN_ . hector _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ a cliche _UNKNOWN_ with a _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ , offering _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ to the movie . the green lantern corps _UNKNOWN_ also did not make as _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ . if the corps trust the rings so _UNKNOWN_ , why is it so burdensome to put confidence in the selection of hal jordan ? it just seemed _UNKNOWN_ the _UNKNOWN_ were creating these conflicts just because they wanted to . there was no actual purpose to any of the _UNKNOWN_ disputes in the movie . the vfx and cgi are also _UNKNOWN_ . the animated suits look _UNKNOWN_ flawed , and the other _UNKNOWN_ creatures are not the _UNKNOWN_ looking . parallax and kilowog looked _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ , and that is only in the handful of _UNKNOWN_ . it does n't help that the _UNKNOWN_ is _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ here . it _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ dion beebe did not have _UNKNOWN_ practical sets to present oa , the green lantern planet . the framing of each _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ off with _UNKNOWN_ shown in inconvenient positions . an abundance of _UNKNOWN_ felt _UNKNOWN_ the _UNKNOWN_ around them was being hidden . perhaps it was a _UNKNOWN_ thing the _UNKNOWN_ around the _UNKNOWN_ is not present as _UNKNOWN_ because the production design was inadequate . oa felt rundown and not as vibrant as it should be . that goes _UNKNOWN_ to dion beebe 's _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ , as the _UNKNOWN_ did n't _UNKNOWN_ right on oa as _UNKNOWN_ . the _UNKNOWN_ is _UNKNOWN_ satisfactory , but it is _UNKNOWN_ to take them seriously when they do not look right . ryan _UNKNOWN_ is fine as the lead _UNKNOWN_ , _UNKNOWN_ his line delivery felt _UNKNOWN_ it was trying to spoof a cringe _UNKNOWN_ film . it 's _UNKNOWN_ to tell if he is trying to be serious in his role as he does n't sell it . blake lively was probably the _UNKNOWN_ out of _UNKNOWN_ in the _UNKNOWN_ , _UNKNOWN_ she did n't sell that she was in _UNKNOWN_ with hal . _UNKNOWN_ , both _UNKNOWN_ and lively could n't sell their _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ . the two actors and the script could not get their _UNKNOWN_ right . peter sarsgaard does a _UNKNOWN_ job when he is not in prosthetics , but once his head enlarges , it gets rough . sarsgaard can not act with the prosthetics on . it is not _UNKNOWN_ his fault , as having such a large _UNKNOWN_ of prosthetics on you limits your acting abilities . _UNKNOWN_ , it does _UNKNOWN_ the movie _UNKNOWN_ a bit . the supporting _UNKNOWN_ is fine with mark _UNKNOWN_ and angela bassett doing a decent job , _UNKNOWN_ they do n't have _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ to redeem the movie . the one decent aspect of the movie would have to be that the action sequences are _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ . those _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ rushed or half-baked . the fight and action sequences are just right . _UNKNOWN_ aspect of the film that is not too _UNKNOWN_ is _UNKNOWN_ campbell 's directing . it is _UNKNOWN_ , and campbell knows how to create a tone for the movie that is achieved here and not in the _UNKNOWN_ aspects of the film . _UNKNOWN_ , green lantern is a rather _UNKNOWN_ film that has so _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ flaws . the _UNKNOWN_ is a total _UNKNOWN_ with _UNKNOWN_ to no explanation on _UNKNOWN_ plot points . the film has some atrocious _UNKNOWN_ that are unacceptable in a blockbuster released in 2011. with ryan _UNKNOWN_ and blake lively doing _UNKNOWN_ to save this film , only _UNKNOWN_ campbell does the _UNKNOWN_ he could at keeping green lantern afloat . read more _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ this at _UNKNOWN_"

'' gene siskel named judge dredd one of the _UNKNOWN_ motion _UNKNOWN_ of 1995 as _UNKNOWN_ of his _UNKNOWN_ of 1995 ' _UNKNOWN_ on siskel and ebert . roger ebert , in his _UNKNOWN_ for the chicago _UNKNOWN_ , gave the film 2 out of 4 and wrote : `` stallone survives it , but his supporting _UNKNOWN_ , also including an uninvolved joan chen and a tremendously intense jurgen prochnow , is n't _UNKNOWN_ used . '' todd _UNKNOWN_ of variety called it `` a thunderous , _UNKNOWN_ futuristic _UNKNOWN_ show for _UNKNOWN_ boys . '' owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly gave it a grade of c+ and wrote : `` the movie , by the end , practically seems intent on destroying itself .

'' mick lasalle of the san francisco chronicle gave the film 1 out of 4 , and wrote : `` usually engaging and sympathetic , stallone is blank and tongue-tied here , an immovable slab in the midst of 95 _UNKNOWN_ of gunfire , explosions and gothic excess . '' rita kempley of the washington post wrote : `` aside from the affable schneider and the able lane , the _UNKNOWN_ seems to be in _UNKNOWN_ shock . um , make that dredd lock . '' james _UNKNOWN_ of reelviews wrote : `` _UNKNOWN_ , it 's rather amusing , but it 's impossible to decide whether this is accidental or on purpose . '' in a 2017 retrospective _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ trenholm from cnet wrote that the film `` drew more more shrewdly on the _UNKNOWN_ 's abundant _UNKNOWN_ than the 2012 version '' and `` _UNKNOWN_ nailed the look of mega _UNKNOWN_ one '' . trenholm noted that `` sets , costumes and vehicles were _UNKNOWN_ '' , while `` looming abc _UNKNOWN_ and grotesque angel gang '' were `` both triumphs of pre-cgi physical effects '' . in 2020 , on the 25th anniversary of the film , drew dietsch of giant freakin robot praised the _UNKNOWN_ elements of the film `` as a _UNKNOWN_ of pure production , judge dredd needs to be _UNKNOWN_ as one of the _UNKNOWN_ achievements of the '90s . _UNKNOWN_ about the film 's texture is a _UNKNOWN_ success . '' _UNKNOWN_ criticized `` judge dredd '' for its script and perceived lack of _UNKNOWN_ and faith to its source material , _UNKNOWN_ with stallone 's acting . the film is often considered to be one of stallone 's _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ , but its _UNKNOWN_ style , effects , _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ , stunts and action sequences were praised , and the film was nominated for four saturn _UNKNOWN_ . danny cannon´s movie version of the 2000 ad _UNKNOWN_ is _UNKNOWN_ ok to my mind i must say _UNKNOWN_ the negative criticism . stallone is ok as judge dredd to a certain extent ( _UNKNOWN_ if he takes off the helmet ) , the _UNKNOWN_ diane lane is _UNKNOWN_ as judge hershey , armand assante evil as rico and it´s _UNKNOWN_ a treat to see max von sydow ( rest his soul ) . the sets of mega _UNKNOWN_ one are _UNKNOWN_ in my book ( that took a _UNKNOWN_ to build ) , the judge´s guns , uniforms and bikes are _UNKNOWN_ as _UNKNOWN_ , while the effects are a bit wobbly . i think that the _UNKNOWN_ has flaws , why add rob schneider´s _UNKNOWN_ herman `` fergee '' ferguson as some sort of sidekick for example , but it´s not all _UNKNOWN_ which john wagner , the creator of judge dredd thought . it´s clear that `` judge dredd '' has certain pluses and minuses and the same goes for the 2012 `` dredd '' version . _UNKNOWN_ , i am still hoping that karl urban will return as judge dredd with a script based on the _UNKNOWN_ judges ... trivia : prior to the film 's _UNKNOWN_ premiere on 30 june 1995 , judge dredd had to be re-cut and submitted to the mpaa five _UNKNOWN_ in order to get it down from a nc-17 to a r rating . this was before stallone and the studio tried to cut the film _UNKNOWN_ further to get a pg-13 rating . _UNKNOWN_ danny cannon was so _UNKNOWN_ over the constant creative disputes with stallone that he swore he would _UNKNOWN_ again work with _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ actor . he also stated that the _UNKNOWN_ version was completely _UNKNOWN_ from the script due to the creative changes demanded by stallone . in _UNKNOWN_ interviews , stallone said he thought the film was _UNKNOWN_ to be an action _UNKNOWN_ film so demanded rewrites to make it more _UNKNOWN_ . the _UNKNOWN_ and _UNKNOWN_ had a _UNKNOWN_ , more satirical vision . _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ sequences were deleted from the theatrical release to reduce the violence and _UNKNOWN_ tone of the film . for example , a _UNKNOWN_ where rico kills _UNKNOWN_ reporter hammond and his wife was _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ and bloodier because it showed them getting hit by bullets in slow-motion . _UNKNOWN_ the abc _UNKNOWN_ robot was to kill judge griffin by ripping his arms and legs off but this was also changed . cannon wanted more violence ( because it was in keeping with the _UNKNOWN_ 's source material ) but the studio and stallone wanted a pg-13 movie with more focus on _UNKNOWN_ . _UNKNOWN_ the film 's climax was deleted , _UNKNOWN_ showing dredd fighting and killing clone judges was removed prior to the theatrical release . some promotional stills were published in judge dredd megazine showing dredd shooting one of the clones . john wagner , the creator of the _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ on which the film was based , said when interviewed by empire in 2012 : `` the _UNKNOWN_ had _UNKNOWN_ to do with judge dredd , and judge dredd was n't _UNKNOWN_ judge dredd . '' wagner said it was a pity the _UNKNOWN_ the film turned out , _UNKNOWN_ the production values were _UNKNOWN_ , and they had the budget for it . in an interview with total film magazine , he said the film had `` _UNKNOWN_ the wrong _UNKNOWN_ '' because it `` tried to do too _UNKNOWN_ '' ."

146,1077027-batman_and_robin,audience,3.5,p,"joel schumacher 's batman and robin is unabashedly _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ , and for that reason it probably alienates a lot of _UNKNOWN_ batman fans . add in the unpopular _UNKNOWN_ of george clooney as the caped crusader , and you have a recipe for the series taking a lengthy hiatus immediately after this film 's release . but at its _UNKNOWN_ , the movie _UNKNOWN_ exactly what it sets out to accomplish , buoyed by a couple of spry _UNKNOWN_ , a phantasmagoria of costumes and decorations , and a one-note script that rarely strays from the 1960s show it means to honor . following the enormous success of batman in 1989 , tim burton dialed up the _UNKNOWN_ to 10 for his follow-up , batman returns . that effort proved _UNKNOWN_ , though , and paved the _UNKNOWN_ for a _UNKNOWN_ direction in the franchise . enter schumacher , who helmed both batman _UNKNOWN_ and this film . here he takes batman to the _UNKNOWN_ extreme , which _UNKNOWN_ suits the _UNKNOWN_ of _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ as mr. freeze and uma thurman as poison ivy , the film 's _UNKNOWN_ villains . _UNKNOWN_ 's freeze , confined to a suit that regulates his _UNKNOWN_ , _UNKNOWN_ has a line that does n't make a pun on the _UNKNOWN_ , while thurman is game as the botanist turned evildoer poison ivy . the two make an odd pairing , but they lend the film ample energy . ivy 's _UNKNOWN_ , which mostly involve spraying a _UNKNOWN_ supply of pheromone that turns men into easily manipulated puppets , are not _UNKNOWN_ explained . still , thurman does n't _UNKNOWN_ down from the chance to _UNKNOWN_ a bitter scientist-turned-supervillain whose theories were _UNKNOWN_ at by gotham 's _UNKNOWN_ that be . she _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ over-sexualizing the _UNKNOWN_ and is believably bitter _UNKNOWN_ the establishment . on the other hand , bane is an unwieldy presence in the film , depicted here as an unholy frankenstein 's monster who 's brought to life by a mad scientist trying to create a breed of super _UNKNOWN_ for sale . rather than the intellectual giant of the _UNKNOWN_ , this incarnation of bane is a mindless ape doing poison ivy 's bidding for _UNKNOWN_ of the film . besides helping to overrun some of gotham 's finest , his role is largely unnecessary . ditto that of alicia silverstone 's batgirl , _UNKNOWN_ given that batman is already aided by the acrobatic robin , _UNKNOWN_ by chris o'donnell . o'donnell _UNKNOWN_ for a serviceable sidekick , _UNKNOWN_ if _UNKNOWN_ petulant . the very inclusion of robin gives the film a _UNKNOWN_ dimension that does n't appear elsewhere in the _UNKNOWN_ batman _UNKNOWN_ . silverstone was still _UNKNOWN_ off the massive success of clueless , a movie that was _UNKNOWN_ her peak . her acting chops have _UNKNOWN_ been notable , and while this movie is n't leaning on the strength of its _UNKNOWN_ , she fits into the _UNKNOWN_ in no more than an _UNKNOWN_ , ancillary _UNKNOWN_ . having the dynamic duo take on freeze and poison ivy would have been _UNKNOWN_ without throwing in the others . the choice of clooney as batman is understandably controversial . he is stiff in the batsuit and _UNKNOWN_ offkey in his _UNKNOWN_ as bruce _UNKNOWN_ . whereas thurman and _UNKNOWN_ lean into the film 's corny tone , clooney looks embarrassed and too cool for the role . and when it came _UNKNOWN_ to dress bruce _UNKNOWN_ , the costumers that went the extra mile on the rest of the _UNKNOWN_ suddenly ran out of ideas . _UNKNOWN_ , we 're forced to look at _UNKNOWN_ sporting a black dad hoodie and black dad robe . the myriad of sets are a garish palette of colors , a kaleidoscopic collision reminiscent of a child 's _UNKNOWN_ foray into finger painting . still , the sheer volume of props and effects are remarkable , offering plenty to ogle for multiple viewings . there 's nods to mad max , a clockwork orange , and _UNKNOWN_ shop of horrors , and yes , an _UNKNOWN_ of neon . no _UNKNOWN_ is complete without an excess of _UNKNOWN_ and their multitude of props . this asthetic is embodied by a mid-film motorcycle race that does _UNKNOWN_ for the plot but still _UNKNOWN_ to feature a coolio cameo , _UNKNOWN_ random explosions , most of the extras from mad max , a green fire , and robin _UNKNOWN_ a physics-defying grab to save batgirl 's life . the script is _UNKNOWN_ with a seemingly _UNKNOWN_ stream of puns , corny jokes , cheeky sexual innuendos , and cringe worthy one-liners . as such , it pays _UNKNOWN_ to the 1960s batman live action tv show that so _UNKNOWN_ grew up _UNKNOWN_ after school . the commitment to this _UNKNOWN_ must have been an enormous writing challenge , _UNKNOWN_ that fact alone does not make the script _UNKNOWN_ engaging . while the adam west scripts needed to fill only a 40-minute _UNKNOWN_ , typically spread across a _UNKNOWN_ show , this movie runs _UNKNOWN_ over two hours . _UNKNOWN_ the _UNKNOWN_ , the viewer is left a bit numb by the silliness of the _UNKNOWN_ . the _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ are the ones that rely on minimal _UNKNOWN_ , notably a battle on ice skates between batman and robin and mr. freeze 's minions that 's set in a museum . it 's here that we 're introduced to _UNKNOWN_ 's heavily shellacked and thickly accented _UNKNOWN_ guy , as he riffs on the defining feature of his _UNKNOWN_ : the _UNKNOWN_ . because of the script 's devotion to puny _UNKNOWN_ , the plot points that do arise all get glossed over . we have references to mr. freeze trying to save his wife from dying of a rare disease , alfred having a similar rare disease , concerns about environmental destruction , unethical scientists creating _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ experiments , bruce _UNKNOWN_ being afraid of _UNKNOWN_ commitment , batman being afraid of collegial commitment , batgirl wanting to find a cure to save alfred and lift him from his servitude in _UNKNOWN_ manner , and _UNKNOWN_ a jealous poison ivy deceiving mr. freeze while attempting to kill his wife . but none of this _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ it matters _UNKNOWN_ in the _UNKNOWN_ scheme of things , as _UNKNOWN_ as _UNKNOWN_ can belt out _UNKNOWN_ corny joke about the need to chill while pointing his gun at a crowd . the one _UNKNOWN_ subplot focusing on whether batman can _UNKNOWN_ trust robin as his _UNKNOWN_ is largely dismissed and not fleshed out . in a _UNKNOWN_ movie , that could have been a theme to build on , one that would either end in a _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ bond or in an ongoing conflict , perhaps _UNKNOWN_ pushing robin into his own solo crime fighting career . the latter idea was brought to _UNKNOWN_ life in a _UNKNOWN_ series where robin adopts the identity of _UNKNOWN_ . but here the writers are dedicated to a singular vision of what the live-action tv show provided , and they _UNKNOWN_ faithful to the camp for which the show was famous . one thing to appreciate about batman and robin is that it sets the _UNKNOWN_ for _UNKNOWN_ nolan 's _UNKNOWN_ trilogy . of course , the reason is that this movie essentially killed the series . but it does so by swinging the pendulum for the tone of batman so far the other _UNKNOWN_ from burton 's _UNKNOWN_ that it left the studio _UNKNOWN_ nowhere to go . by 1997 , the _UNKNOWN_ had four batman _UNKNOWN_ in an _UNKNOWN_ span , and they had seen most of the major _UNKNOWN_ , both hero and villain . they had also seen the extremes of what a batman film could be in terms of mood and atmosphere . thus , into the _UNKNOWN_ freeze with the series until nolan thawed it out eight _UNKNOWN_ _UNKNOWN_ with batman begins . had the franchise limped _UNKNOWN_ with a handful of mediocre _UNKNOWN_ in the ensuing _UNKNOWN_ , nolan may _UNKNOWN_ have had the chance to develop his own vision . in all , batman and robin has lots of _UNKNOWN_ , an _UNKNOWN_ budget for huge set _UNKNOWN_ , the ( _UNKNOWN_ ) cheesiest script _UNKNOWN_ seen in a _UNKNOWN_ movie , and of course the ending you expected . but with the right attitude going in , this can prove to be an _UNKNOWN_ , if cringey , watch ."
