0,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,Extraordinary. [Full review in Spanish]
1,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Director Florian Zeller makes light work of this adaption of his play, using the camera to recreate the claustrophobia and uncertainty of relying on an uncertain mind."
2,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Anthony Hopkins is one of the best actors alive right now, undoubtedly. The Father was one of the best surprises of 2020, with an incredible visual concept that blows my mind when I think this is Zeller's first film. [Full review in Spanish]"
3,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"[Much] of the strength of the film lies in Anthony Hopkins' lead performance alongside Olivia Colman, Zeller's direction is nothing to sniff at."
4,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,It's a film that's worth more for its conception and execution than its ideological discourse or social agenda. [Full review in Spanish]
5,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Memory is not linear, and 'The Father' captures what it must feel like when memories stop connecting. Anthony Hopkins gives one of his great performances."
6,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,The film seamlessly blends genuine fear with overwhelming sadness.
7,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Hopkins...has never been better. And, given his much garlanded career, that really is saying something."
8,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Watching The Father feels like watching a particularly good episode of Black Mirror, without any of the tech paranoia."
9,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"A forensic examination, powerfully written and delivered with brio, of the impact of dementia on a retired engineer and those closest to him"
10,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"The word ""devastating"" is used so much as to be almost devalued. But, in its truest, most powerful sense, The Father is devastating."
11,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"There is no gawdy tricks, nor leaning on tropes. From start to finish The Father is exactly what you see it as. Confusing, scary, loving, and sad."
12,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"It has an exceptional script, and not only because of the dialogues' quality, but because it plays with what the viewer sees and understands. [Full review in Spanish]"
13,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"[Anthony Hopkins] is absolutely remarkable here. I read the screenplay, available online, out of curiosity, and what he brings to the words on the page is beyond and beyond and beyond. Hopkins has played King Lear (twice) but this is his real King Lear."
14,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"The way Zeller and his production designer Peter Francis orchestrate these changes are almost imperceptible, but nevertheless disorienting and utterly crucial to the narrative."
15,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,Watching two great performers together provides The Father's highpoint.
16,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Without resorting to exploitative, amped-up mystery or obfuscation, Zeller and co-writer Christopher Hampton have fashioned a sort of gaslight thriller in which the mind is both predator and prey."
17,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Zeller has delivered not only the best film adaptation of the season, but one of the most effective, moving and, dare I say, cinematic films of the year."
18,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,Yet The Father is a powerful debut. The mood of isolation with its warped sense of time and the distanced characters confined to their homes: this film reflects our present moment without labouring the point home or making the obvious analogies.
19,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"This is a film of immeasurable power which everyone should experience once. It explores the frailties of being human, in a society which increasingly values youth over experience."
20,the_father_2021,audience,4.0,n,"A stellar acting from Anthony Hopkins and Olivier Coleman. The movie is in the perspective of the lead character ‘Anthony’ who is suffering from dementia. The main actor (Hopkins) perfectly depicts what a person goes through/feels when they are subjected to dementia. While watching the movie, viewers would also have hard time separating the reality (present) and memories (past) of Anthony as he mixes both of them up."
21,the_father_2021,audience,4.0,n,"A good movie, but the other one with Viggo Mortenson is more gritty and real - Falling"
22,the_father_2021,audience,4.5,n,"Hopkins has never been better than this, playing a fragile man fallen apart though dementia, The Father is a devastating look at what people go though entirely alone, even if they have people around them."
23,the_father_2021,audience,5.0,n,"Honestly one of the greatest movies I've seen. You experience what someone with Alzheimer's goes through on a daily basis. The cast was spectacular, Anthony Hopkins gives an amazing performance throughout the film you feel as if he actually has the disease. Truly a great film and does its job at spreading awareness."
24,the_father_2021,audience,5.0,n,Visually stunning. Clean work right here.
25,the_father_2021,audience,2.5,p,"An accurate yet depressing look at life as one gets old and loses touch with reality. Troubling look at the beauty of family commitment and the toll it takes on the loved ones. Not sure it is worth watching, unless you like sadness and emotional pain."
26,the_father_2021,audience,5.0,n,Fabulously sad. I almost walked out with PTSD - my Dad went through this with his own father - the parallels were scary!
27,the_father_2021,audience,2.0,p,"Talk about a true head spin, the setup felt like it should be there, but the camera work, and the circling dialogue, just put your head in a blender and hit the extreme button on the end of the machine."
28,the_father_2021,audience,5.0,n,Immersive and heartbreaking to say the least.
29,the_father_2021,audience,4.0,n,I appreciated being able to simultaneously empathize with and consider the perspective of both leads.
30,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,But the bigger problem with the film is that it suffers from the girlboss-ification of female characters that has seeped into media over the few years.
31,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,A fabulous director and two awesome stars battle their way through a wonky script.
32,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,"While it improves in the second half, Black Widow is too uneven and generic to recommend. Telling a story about freewill and liberation is ironically littered with too many artistic compromises."
33,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Fun, funny, and frenetic without being overwhelming. [Full Review in Spanish]"
34,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Johansson is good, better than she's been given the opportunity to be before with this role, but she - like Black Widow is still stunted in many ways by the vision the MCU has for Natasha which makes this feel more elegiac than energetic."
35,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Marvel finally releases the Black Widow origin story, but how many more years before we see another one?"
36,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Natasha deserved a better memorial.
37,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Bland spy hooey. Although Pugh is a standout.
38,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Black Widow is worth seeing for Florence Pugh, the free-fall action sequence, and anything involving Taskmaster before it's revealed who is under the mask. The film mostly feels like it was done better by the films it was supposedly influenced by."
39,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,The rawness made for a spirited episode that every Marvel fan needs to listen to.
40,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"It would've been amazing to receive this movie 4 years ago, now it's just too late. That doesn't mean it's not a worthy closure for a much beloved character. [Full review in Spanish]"
41,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,The positives do outweigh the negatives but it does frustratingly end up feeling middle-of-the-road in terms of the MCU output.
42,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Black Widow is not as tedious and self-serious an entry as some of them. But that is setting the bar low.
43,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,What ensues is a film that isn't interested in planting seeds for future Marvel movies -- which is actually a refreshing change of pace.
44,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Pugh is the only victory for this vanilla Marvel movie. [...] Fans are left wondering what could have been. And Johansson is left fighting a lawsuit against the world's biggest entertainment behemoth - a mission that seems too much even for Natasha.
45,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Black Widow achieves the unthinkable and dethrones Thor: The Dark World as the worst film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
46,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,"The spotlight should firmly be on her, or so you would have thought, but for all its acrobatic female kick-ass baddery poor old Natasha Romanoff has to share that limelight with her highly skilled ""family"" to bring down the patriarchy."
47,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Almost completely lacking in Black Widow is any sense of outrage over the grotesque violations of human rights and human dignity at the root of the whole premise of the film.
48,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,"The problem with Black Widow is that the whole ordeal feels like an obligatory afterthought, simply going through the motions with only a perfunctory sense of charm."
49,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Black Widow has everything going on: dysfunctional families, sibling rivalry, a fatuous Russian superhero, a cackling Bond villain and an army of female assassins. What more do you want?"
50,black_widow_2021,audience,1.0,p,Boring and irrelevant story. Attempts at Russian accents were distracting throughout. Relying too much on a VFX heavy ending to the point where it was too much / action was too unbelievable at the end even for a film like this.
51,black_widow_2021,audience,5.0,n,o que mas me convenceu foi a trajetória na viúva Negra. a o gancho de ramificações para novo heróis. foi incrível.
52,black_widow_2021,audience,1.5,p,"The most generic, predictable and boring movie I've seen from the MCU in a long time, something very forgettable that is sustained in the pure participation of its actors, in that case I would have paid for a family sitcom with Scarlet Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbor and Rachel Weisz."
53,black_widow_2021,audience,3.5,n,"Pretty good, the younger sister does a great job.  The movie is full of light-hearted family dynamics that are funny.  Scarlet did a great job the problem was with Task Master.  Couple that with the flying or falling for like 30 mins really.  Step it up Marvel."
54,black_widow_2021,audience,4.0,n,"A long overdue, fantastic solo movie. Taskmaster was a bit of a missed opportunity, and the film can get slightly too ambitious at times. Neither of these complaints detract much from what is a very solid, satisfying examination of Natasha's past."
55,black_widow_2021,audience,1.5,p,"Uninteresting story, badly told, decently acted and horrendously edited"
56,black_widow_2021,audience,3.0,n,"Nothing new or inventive, but not every Marvel movie gets to be great. Some just need to check the boxes and fill out the time in between Spider-Man movies."
57,black_widow_2021,audience,2.5,p,"This movie came more than a decade too late. Also this is not a Black Widow movie, it's a movie to set up her replacement in the MCU.
Another predictable marvel movie that does nothing to push the envelope where the stars have plot armor and according to the laws of physic and basic biology should have died more than once. And that has some mindboggling weird plot choices. 
The acting was great but the only thing that kept me watching was Florence Pugh great and both emotional and funny performance."
58,black_widow_2021,audience,3.5,n,"This feels like a phase one movie - It's not bad at all, but that title sequence showed me that with a higher age rating it could have been one of the most interesting MCU movies, which does make the end product sting a little.
As it is - it's a decent MCU movie. The chemistry between the cast was great, the action was pretty good."
59,black_widow_2021,audience,3.5,n,Great action movie with many funny lines.
60,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,Small details... give weight to a story about an immaterial person. [Full review in Spanish]
61,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"A thriller whose mandate is to startle its audience with surface-level shocks while simultaneously subverting expectations in a deeper way, dropping us out of our comfort zone toward some sunken place."
62,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"He (Whannell) uses the cinematic language to his advantage, moving the camera in ways which show that he is in complete control of his audience."
63,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,Imbues its classic horror story with real-life terror.
64,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Though influenced by the earlier film, Writer-Director Leigh Whannell reworks outdated elements and comes up with a surprisingly relevant take on the powers provided by invisibility."
65,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"It's fast and violent but crystalline in clarity...letting us experience the violence, shame, confusion, and anger that Cecilia does rather than explaining it to us."
66,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,From the film's opening titles you can tell you're in for something special.
67,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,This film - with its science-fiction slant - delivers scares and works as a heightened examination of obsession and an abusive relationship.
68,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,Leigh Whannell's update of the classic concept stars Elisabeth Moss as the ex-girlfriend of a millionaire inventor turned high-tech gaslighter whose goal is to erase his victim's humanity as effectively as he has obscured his own visibility.
69,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,rotten,n,"The film falls into stale traps, ones so basic and obvious that it's almost maddening to see them regurgitated for yet another rote thriller."
70,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"With some great acting and solid storytelling, The Invisible Man has only strengthened the legacy of Wells' story."
71,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Timely, relevant, and genuinely terrifying...The Invisible Man recontextualizes a classic Universal monster into a modern examination of abuse, toxicity, and gaslighting."
72,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,It's doubtful any of The Invisible Man would work so well ... without Moss.
73,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Staring, waiting, preparing for the worst creates the most unease in the viewer ... Whannell's script is equal parts action, suspense and surprise. He doesn't go for the easy scare, and much of the film is anxiety-inducing, not seat-jumping."
74,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"'The Invisible Man' displays how victims can be in constant danger, whether they're at home or in a crowded room."
75,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The Invisible Man is one of the best horror movies in recent years and, of course, one of the best movies of 2020."
76,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Whannell's simmering long shots get under the skin, the ambient soundscape is successfully designed to terrify."
77,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Anchored by a raw performance from Elisabeth Moss, The Invisible Man cements Leigh Whannell's spot in the horror directors' Hall of Fame."
78,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"I may not have seen every invisible man remake and sequel there is, but of all the ones I have seen this is the best, even better than the original 1933 classic starring Claude Rains (which nevertheless was a technological marvel for its day)."
79,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Anchored by another awesome performance by Moss, this urgently topical reworking of the HG Wells tale is a terrifically gripping thriller - and a brilliant metaphor for hidden coercive control."
80,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,2.0,p,"Totally forgettable. Kinda cool, but these ratings are just… silly really."
81,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,5.0,n,Incredible film. Great theme. Ending made me jump out of my seat.
82,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,2.0,p,"It was somewhat predictable. Not worthy of Elisabeth Moss' talent. Not bad, just not great."
83,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,4.0,n,"I did not expect to like this film as much as I did. Interesting story well made, and definitely worth two hours of your time."
84,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,2.0,p,Wow!! Galway through the movie I began to root for the invisible to just kill her do the movie would end. How do directors watch a scene and not see the stupidity? Elizabeth Moss has a gun 5 inches from her and decided to grab it after about 8 policemen die? Seriously? A policeman sees something and decides to reach for a taser 10 seconds later?
85,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,3.5,n,"There are a lot of things not working in the film but then again, all horror films are flawed. The first part is strange and I didn't connect with the characters much. The thrill starts when ... oh, I'm not giving info about the best part, the last 1/3 of the film."
86,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,3.5,n,"I was losing interest in the rather slow first half of the movie. However, It does pick up dramatically and became a much more tense and interesting movie thereafter.
Worth the watch and Elizabeth moss is excellent in it."
87,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,2.5,p,"It was ok, trailer was more promising I'd say and in the end just weird."
88,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,1.0,p,"Wish I can make this film invisible.
1/2 star for directing that was clunky and cheap horror movieish. 

0 stars for another film ripping off a classic title, bastardizing from the true title origin and from future use.
 
1/2 star for Elizabeth Moss fair acting - but she over did it and failed to create a sympathetic character.  She came off as unlikeable to all other characters, so we did not feel empathetic to her survival.  The more I watched it the more I wished she would disappear."
89,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,1.5,p,Very entertaining. Interesting take on the invisible man. cheap-predictable rushed ending that insults the viewers intelligence.
90,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,These characters actually experience and that tiny shift really refreshes the franchise.
91,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,Kudos to Pixar for making yet another film that satisfies on so many levels.
92,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,A sublime ending to a perfect franchise.
93,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,"Pixar's franchise heads into new territory with this funny, poignant, charming road trip about passing on the baton."
94,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,"It may not have truly needed to be made, but Toy Story 4 is just as good as any of the other films in the series and proves once again that Pixar is the undisputed master in the animation field."
95,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,"While I have to acknowledge that it isn't a particularly necessary movie, I also must say I'm so very glad they made it."
96,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,"What Pixar does so well is they take something familiar or, in this case, done thrice before, and make it fresh ... Toy Story 4 is a beautiful bookend to a story that holds a special place in the hearts of many."
97,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,"Although it's unusual for Pixar to continue a series for this long, if each new episode is going to remain this spectacular, keep them coming."
98,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,"Though the film covers much of the same ground from the three previous entries, there's still enough emotional gas in the tank to make this worth seeing."
99,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,"Toy Story 4 is more like an epilogue than a new chapter. A funny, moving, surreal epilogue filled with existential angst."
100,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,I'm not crying. You're crying.
101,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,"Let's hope new renditions of Disney properties continue such correctives, and that genre revisionism will again be in service."
102,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,Toy Story 4 proves there's still life in these toys in an emotionally heartfelt tale.
103,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,One of the most admirable things about Toy Story 4 is its refusal to bow to the easy call of nostalgia.
104,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,At least the end result is a fun jaunt. Anything past this would just tug its threads to a fray.
105,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,"Josh Cooley's feature debut is yet another showcase of heartfelt entertainment, alive with energy and delivering yet another tear-jerking roundhouse of a finale."
106,toy_story_4,critics,rotten,n,"I notice the absence of magic, humor and sense of wonder that characterizes the three past films. [Full review in Spanish]"
107,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,"If the ""Toy Story"" trilogy took us to infinity, the fourth installment just took us beyond. Here's hoping Woody hangs his hat here and goes out on top."
108,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,"It plays like a nice, warm, final hug before we all have to grow up and move on."
109,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,Woody and co will make you heartily smile in the heartfelt and wholesome fourth outing.
110,toy_story_4,audience,3.0,n,"To keep their new kid happy, Woody must teach a newly created toy, how to be a toy. This film proves that this franchise has legs after the original trilogy. The voice acting and animation are all top notch, as per the norm from Pixar. This film is very Woody centric, leaving Buzz, Jessie, and others to lesser roles. The villain is weak at best and the film may have been better without one. Not a bad film, just not one that I would recommend more than one viewing of."
111,toy_story_4,audience,2.5,p,a totally unnecessary and contradictory film to the previous one
112,toy_story_4,audience,3.0,n,"Toy Story 4 was ok, but we never needed another sequel. I will give praise for the animation though. Still, I won't plan watching it again."
113,toy_story_4,audience,2.5,p,It was good I will never ever ever watch it again too sad
114,toy_story_4,audience,2.0,p,quite an unneeded and boring finally to a movie franchise that had a perfect finish with its 3rd instalment
115,toy_story_4,audience,2.0,p,"I don't care for this movie, I've seen it once, and probably never again."
116,toy_story_4,audience,3.5,n,"It didn't need to be made, but I still had fun with it"
117,toy_story_4,audience,3.0,n,"Es bastante normal , Toy story 4 no esta ni de chiste a nivel de las demas por que arruina el final perfecto de Toy story 3 , le falta personajes mas memorables y no me gusto que Boonie preferiera a un estupido cubierto en vez de a Woody pero esta bien pa pasar el rato"
118,toy_story_4,audience,2.5,p,Good but they really can stop now with this franchise.
119,toy_story_4,audience,3.5,n,Its a pretty good movie but everyone knows that it should have ended in the 3rd one
120,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"A wonderfully bizarre sci-fi rom-com with a polished aesthetic, some architecturally interesting settings, lovely performances, and tragicomic undertones."
121,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,This is the epitome of the 21st (22nd?) century love story.
122,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,Maren Eggert's performance as Alma is subtle and on the mark at all times; but it is Dan Stevens' portrayal of Tom that is the most eye-catching.
123,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"""I'm Your Man"" is an unexpected delight, succeeding as a romantic comedy - and as much more."
124,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"I'm Your Man is an enjoyable but essentially lightweight affair; it poses questions about love, freedom of will, and what it means to be human but doesn't really attempt to answer them."
125,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"A lovely gem of a scifi rom-com that's witty and delightfully entertaining, featuring a career-best performance from the ever-so-versatile Dan Stevens. Definitely my favorite film about human + AI love story since Spike Jonze's HER."
126,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,A spunky sci-fi dramedy that asks some good questions about what humans want in relationships and if AI beings should have rights.
127,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Schrader doesn't overwhelm with the science-fiction aspects of the story (though the scene where a nightclub is populated with holograms is cleverly done), instead letting the human elements unfold gracefully and into unexpected directions."
128,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Some more original elements could have made I'm Your Man a more memorable and powerful experience. As is, the movie won't become a genre classic, but sci-fi and rom-com fans will still find it an enjoyable watch."
129,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Ultimately, this film leaves you thinking as much as it leaves you smiling."
130,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,The bittersweet tone provides just the right setting for an understated setting where holograms and sentient robots seem almost natural.
131,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,I'm Your Man is a very satisfying genre-defying cross between Her and Ex Machina and any Kate Hepburn romantic comedy - but from a decidedly feminist point of view.
132,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Here's a rom-com with heart and depth. Maria Schrader's I'm Your Man presents a powerful examination of the nature of love and what qualifies as having a 'soul', which is to say, what it means to exist with meaning."
133,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"A thoughtful film that both tugs at our heart and makes us think, and Dan Stevens and Maren Eggert turn in strong, affecting performances that help propel the film."
134,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,Robot Tom is like a puppy who is hit by a newspaper ... still loving but with a little hurt behind his eyes. A romantic story that actually has something to say about romance.
135,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,Utterly delightful is the only way to describe I'm Your Man.
136,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"It's a rich story full of fun, wonder, lapses and questions about the ethics of robot love and partnership, big questions dealt with in sweet ways."
137,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"A delightful exploration of humanity and love, I'm Your Man is a rom-com that thankfully never quite goes where you expect."
138,im_your_man_2021,critics,rotten,n,There was not enough rom or com or sci-fi in this rom-com sci-fi film. This was a cool concept where they didn't really add anything to the genre.
139,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Honestly, if Jane Austen were alive and writing on a MacBook, she might come up with something like this."
140,im_your_man_2021,audience,4.5,n,"Presents both sides of the argument well: on one hand, fashioning your own dream partner is living in a make-believe world, but on the other hand, finding companionship in ANY reasonable way is life-fulfilling and life-affirming."
141,im_your_man_2021,audience,5.0,n,"I wondered whether the premise would wear thin, but I needn't have worried. The film keeps you guessing right up to the unpredictable final moments. Very warmly recommended!"
142,im_your_man_2021,audience,4.5,n,"Beautiful cinematographic and script, one of the best films of 2021"
143,im_your_man_2021,audience,5.0,n,"I was ready to not like it but I did like it. I gave it a chance because it seems like it might be interesting and creative in its exploration, and it was."
144,im_your_man_2021,audience,5.0,n,Absolutely captivating film! While I typically don't watch subtitles films---this is worth watching. Maren Eggert and Dan Stevens are incredible in their roles. The film had some funny parts but also heart-breaking scenes. It is a MUST WATCH if you need something different. (Buy or rent on Apple TV). I definitely see this film being nominated for movie awards!
145,im_your_man_2021,audience,5.0,n,"Amazing movie with layered performances. Somehow a comedy, but full of deep thought and stunning revelations about humanity and love. I suggest purchasing it, as you will want to watch it again. And again."
146,im_your_man_2021,audience,4.0,n,"This is a really delightful, off-kilter comedy with surprising insight into human relationships. Dan Stevens is a comic delight, speaking German throughout, as a robot designed and submitted for approval and evaluation as a lover/companion for a single professional woman. I hope this is Germany's submission in the Oscar race for Best Foreign Language Film. It's pretty great."
147,im_your_man_2021,audience,4.0,n,"I’m Your Man is a very interesting sci-fi romance. Dan Stevens and Maren Eggert were both great. I liked how their relationship developed throughout the film. The film tackles its themes of loneliness and love very well. It kept me engaged throughout. Overall, I quite enjoyed this. It’s smart, funny, and never boring. It takes a smart concept and develops it well. Definitely check it out."
148,im_your_man_2021,audience,4.0,n,"Stevens e o comoara, restul e bun"

152,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"It doesn't pack the psychological punch of Get Out, but Us confirms that Jordan Peele's phenomenal debut film was no fluke -- and the praise he's given is indeed well deserved."
153,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Similar to his first film, Peele practically demands multiple viewings."
154,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,It's a film that confirms Peele as that rarest of things - a true auteur.
155,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,Jordan Peele returns with another inventive and ambitious psychological horror film.
156,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"There's a messiness here, a beautiful anamorphic widescreen messiness that Peele seems to relish."
157,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Us introduces so many ideas that it can be difficult to focus. But it's fascinating to watch those ideas emerge, contort and dance around on screen, even if they don't always come together to form a cohesive story."
158,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,An outlandish story but the powerful message resonates in Trump era America.
159,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"While imperfect, Peele and his team get enough right with Us to make it a worthy follow-up to Get Out. Combining popcorn thrills with thoughtful commentary is Peele's calling card, something that should make him a director to watch for years to come."
160,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Smart and quick witted, Peele knows when he needs to be obvious - title Us also doubles as US, as above so below/mirror image concept, in a pivotal moment, and when to be subtle - ok, not really."
161,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,The best advice I got before heading to the theater was just not to think too hard about it.
162,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Us is a perfect storm of horror, acting, and social commentary: a beautiful dark mirror that conveys a confidence seldom seen in sophomore efforts."
163,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"What sets Us apart from others in the genre, and likewise Peele apart from his contemporaries, is the voice that whispers a warning in every scene, a foreboding that follows you out of the theater and into your sleeping subconscious."
164,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Jordan Peele delivers more of his now signature style, but also flips a switch on something you'd never expect. His ability to create another flawless and compelling story truly cements himself as a true Master of Horror."

166,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"The cast is first-rate, while the cinematography, framing, and editing all sensationally contribute to the supremely disconcerting ordeals."
167,us_2019,critics,rotten,n,The plot twists don't always add up and there are too many red herrings that create a sense of disappointment as Peele doesn't follow through.

169,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"With Us, another simplistic yet petrifying demonstration of the confrontational, Jordan Peele has announced himself as a master of horror."

174,us_2019,audience,1.0,p,"Get Out was great. This movie was a mess. It takes every cliche from all the great B movies and churns them into a movie that makes no sense. I kept waiting for some explanation or something that would salvage this film, but it never came. If you start to ask questions like ""Why do they have scissors?"" or wear red jumps suits when there are not wearing them in other parts etc... Wait till you can see it for free and then it might be worth it."
175,us_2019,audience,4.0,n,"A follow up by Jordan Peele completely beats the ""sophomore jinx.""  It is a horror film that that cites tropes and precedents of horror in order to deeply root the film in the terrain of pop culture and then pull up those roots."
176,us_2019,audience,5.0,n,"Another Jordan Peele masterpiece. Stunningly acted, beautifully directed, the score is 10-10. Slight better than get out and that's saying a lot because Get Out is amazing. Highly recommend"

178,us_2019,audience,3.5,n,A really good horror movie but ultimately let down by its final act. Lupita Nyong'o is awesome but has to carry the film due to a less-than-outstanding cast (with the notable exception of Shahadi Wright Joseph).
179,us_2019,audience,5.0,n,One of the scariest movies I've seen recently. It made me re afraid of the dark for a couple days after watching the movie.

181,promising_young_woman,critics,fresh,p,"This is a superb feature. Indeed, it feels a necessary one."
182,promising_young_woman,critics,rotten,n,"In a strange combination of drama and satire, I didn't find Promising Young Woman to be either revolutionary, nor funny. It lacked the courage to show the true horrors behind its truth. Mulligan is tremendous. [Full review in Spanish]"
183,promising_young_woman,critics,fresh,p,"It's certainly not everyone's cup of tea, and is perhaps not as original as it thinks it is. However, as a thriller exploring what happens when one decides to take justice into their own hands, it's strikingly unforgettable."

186,promising_young_woman,critics,fresh,p,Promising Young Woman shows how an egregious assault is not so dissimilar from the ubiquitous less explicit assaults comprising what we often label 'seduction.'

188,promising_young_woman,critics,fresh,p,"Fennell pushes then questions her avenging angel metaphor, in a bold and funny film that is more about the complicity of good people than the wickedness of bad ones."

200,promising_young_woman,audience,4.0,n,"Pretty good, but cheesy at times"
201,promising_young_woman,audience,5.0,n,"The movie Promising Young Women, directed by Emerald Fennel in 2020, starred Carey Mulligan & Bo Burnham. Is about Cassie a empowered feminist women getting revenge on men who took advantage of her best friend while she was drunk. She makes men feel morally wrong for taking advantage of vulnerable women who are blackout drunk, but she acts to be drunk at bars to then trick the men that go after her, and threatens them to not go after women who are drunk just to have sex with them. But her main goal was to go after the guys who raped her best frined by linking up with her past ""friends"" and she blackmails and manipulates people into giving in and feeling guilt for what they did and not speaking up about it.

One aspect that stood out to me would be the music and lighting. Because the music supported the emotions and actions that were going on in the scenes. Especially when she confronts the people that she is looking for and targeting.

I feel like the movie was well made overall and it can seem sort of dark at times. But its a very solid movie that shows the intentions of men that see vulnerable women as a thing they can exploit for their own pleasure. Which happens in the real world and many get away with it because there's no ""proof"" so to say, And I would recommend this to other people of age to watch it because the movie is constantly making you guess what's going to happen next with unexpected turn of events."
202,promising_young_woman,audience,3.5,n,"Let me start by saying trigger warning as this film contains difficult subjects such as rape and assault. The film is dark and unique (sick at times).  Major parts of the plot is predictable, yet an entertaining thriller that will have you wondering how it'll all end."
203,promising_young_woman,audience,5.0,n,"Wow! This movie is absolutely astonishing with surprising plot twists and suspense that makes it hard to breathe. The music is the kicker here. This is by far the most creative use of pop songs in a movie I have ever heard and it just adds another layer of perfection to it. On top of that, the movie is about an important issue and makes you think long after you finished watching it."
204,promising_young_woman,audience,4.5,n,"Promising Young Women is a thriller/comedy directed by Emerald Fennell in 2020. This film stars Carey Mulligan, Bo Burnham, Alison Brie, and Clancey Brown. Promising Young Women takes place in suburban Ohio. Cassie Thomas who is played by Carey Mulligan was a medical student. She dropped out of medical school and she worked at a coffee shop after. She dropped out to comfort her best friend, Nina. Nina was also a medical student, but she was raped by a fellow colleague. No one believed Nina's story of rape, except Cassie. Nina eventually fell into a depression and this led to her death, suicide. Nina's death traumatized Cassie. This caused the beginning of Cassie's revenge story where she would go to bars alone, act drunk, and then she would lure men to see if they would take advantage of her. That is where everything all began.
	One thing that stood out to me was how the medical students Ryan and Al both knew that they did wrong, but they made the excuse that they were ""just kids"". Al raped Nina while she was drunk and passed out. Ryan took part in the assault by watching and he recorded everything when he had the power to stop it. They were both grown men with successful medical practices, but they both acted like they should have been exempt from all the trauma that they caused since they were ""just kids"". 
I really liked the film, Promising Young Women because the director, Emerald Fennell, did a good job of keeping the audience guessing. There were many plot twists throughout the film. I really believed that Bo Burnham's character, Ryan, was going to change Cassie for the better. I thought that her nights of going out to bars and acting drunk were going to come to an end because of him. He really liked her and she started to like him as well, but everything was ruined when Cassie found out that he was involved in Nina's assault. This really surprised me because I thought he was good. I really liked how throughout the film I could not tell if Cassie was depressed or actually psychotic. The quality of the movie was good, the lighting was different from all the other films that I have watched. I would recommend this movie to young viewers like myself because it shows a very serious topic in a somewhat comedic way. I would give this film 4.5/5 stars."
205,promising_young_woman,audience,3.5,n,"It's a good story, just a bit heavy handed.
But it's definitely watchable."
206,promising_young_woman,audience,5.0,n,I was very impressed by this movie. It's a very entertaining and thought provoking film. My congratulations to Emerald Fennell and the cast for a movie well done.
207,promising_young_woman,audience,4.0,n,Love the concept! The movie was great. Didn't get five because the ending was kinda weird not what you were expecting.
208,promising_young_woman,audience,4.5,n,"Interesting, great performances and thrilling to the end."
209,promising_young_woman,audience,4.0,n,"What goes around comes around.  An obsession never ends well.  Carey is on a quest to right a wrong from her friend and her past.  The men and the women who laughed at a girl being drugged drunk, raped and beaten are sick, beyond sick.  Girls watch it and alcohol ALWAYS clouds the picture and you hope you have a nice guy.  I took several drunken girls home in my time and believe me I could of but what I could not do afterward would be to live with myself if I did.  However, how many guys and women could???"
210,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"It's a good one. If you like Little Woman, the you'll love this interpretation."
211,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Even though it's been 25 years since Winona Ryder, Susan Sarandon, and Christian Bale delighted us in the last version of Little Women, this new version? Definitely worth seeing."
212,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"All the frilly dresses of Little Women's numerous film versions prevented me from accepted Louisa May Alcott's classic story as a pro-feminist creation, even when Katharine Hepburn played the lead. Writer-director Greta Gerwig changed that."
213,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Too many stitches in the narrative quilt, its often rushed sentiment suffocating the genuine moments of resonant emotion. But it does have a thing or two to say about love."
214,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,Gerwig's narrative proposal is modern and dynamic and gives her a fertile ground to reflect on the creative act and femininity with a subtlety that greatly enhances his discourse. The cast is superb in every way [Full review in Spanish]
215,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Why make another ""Little Women"" adaptation? Because we all needed Greta Gerwig's magical touch on this delightful tale. Gerwig taps into the same honest vulnerability she succeed in through her Oscar nominated film, ""Lady Bird""."
216,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"One of the best films of the year, it's a tonic for recent depressing events."
217,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,Gerwig's sumptuous film shows a modern audience that feminism and romance can fit together nicely...
218,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"To her credit, and to one's pleasant surprise, Gerwig does not attempt to inject contemporary identity politics into her film, at least not overly so."
219,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"With the high level of acting and a filmmaker proving her chops once again, these Little Women are well worth your time."
220,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"It has all the coziness and warmth one expects from this sort of nostalgic period drama, while also capturing the revolutionary spirit of Alcott's novel."
221,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"A rarity, an adaptation of an often told tale that manages a rethink while still holding true to what made the source material so beloved."
222,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,Rarely does an adaptation so steeped in the national consciousness and embedded in popular culture hit the right notes in the right order for the right audience at the right time.
223,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"These are good people doing their best, loving each other even through their mistakes, and that love emanates from the movie."
224,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Gerwig draws out the progressive strands in Alcott's original, emphasising its latent feminism."
225,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"A superb, well acted adaptation that solidifies Greta Gerwig as one of our greatest filmmakers, that Saoirse Ronan is one of our great actresses, and that Florence Pugh has a terrific career ahead of her."
226,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"[Greta Gerwig] brought a filmmaker's perspective to the story of the March sisters, as she put a meta spin on the proceedings that deviated from the source material ... but seemingly honoured who Louisa May Alcott ... was as a person"
227,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"There isn't a single false note in this tale, and that starts with the acting and goes all the way down to the production design, score, and costumes."
228,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,[Greta Gerwig] indeed offers a fresh spin by infusing her humanistic directorial voice while remaining loyal to the timeless story.
229,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,Little Women proves that Gerwig's directorial debut Lady Bird was no fluke - firmly confirming that she is a great filmmaker; a force to be reckoned with. It shines a new light on a classic story that retains the themes and drama that made it so.
230,little_women_2019,audience,4.5,n,"Absolutely touching and amazing film, I have no words."
231,little_women_2019,audience,3.0,n,Not a bad adaptation with good characterisation in the actors of the March sisters.  However a choppy and confusing stop start storyline and a poor choice in actor for Laurie let's itself down badly. I tend to find it important that when characters are aged up it's important to do all the characters properly. After the time skip compared to the girls Laurie looks to young and it just makes Amy look like a cradle robber.
232,little_women_2019,audience,4.5,n,"This is one of the best movies I've watched... ever. I had to take half a star, though, because there was something plot-wise that I wish were... different."
233,little_women_2019,audience,3.5,n,"I liked everything about this movie except as follows: Emma Watson's acting wasn't very good (I know, I was surprised too)...and the time jumps were confusing to everyone that wasn't already familiar with the story."
234,little_women_2019,audience,5.0,n,esta pelicula es increible con actuaciones solidas
235,little_women_2019,audience,5.0,n,A wondrous gem of a film.
236,little_women_2019,audience,4.0,n,"Entertaining.  Well done.  Seeing Saoirse Ronan & Emma Watson brought into sharp focus the difference in acting ""chops"" of these young women.  Emma should have hung it up after Harry Potter.  Saoirse is an enormous talent.  I think the story is a bit saccharin, but I think Greta Gerwig did a good job getting beyond that and making it interesting."
237,little_women_2019,audience,5.0,n,This movie so gorgeous and story so many emotion. my fellings when i watching it was unpredictable.You must see..
238,little_women_2019,audience,2.0,p,"I have several issues with this movie. If it's the first time experiencing this story, the out of order narrative would be confusing. The costumes and hair are too far off from being correct. I don't require exact historical accuracy, but they just took it too far with this one, especially Joe. I also don't understand why American actors could not be found to play the sisters, although Florence Pugh was lovely. I much prefer the 1994 version with Winona Ryder."
239,little_women_2019,audience,3.5,n,"Peli que en su corto tiempo logra evocar sentimientos novelescos/dramaticos. El cast, su interaccion y el diseño de produccion es de lo mas destacable. (vistas 1)"
240,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Chicken Run, if anything, offers an alternative to a desolate world that many of us are increasingly afraid of."
241,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,So great.
242,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Its plump chickens maintain that strange, haptic quality that makes you yearn to reach out and squeeze them."
243,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Even without Wallace and Gromit, most of the trademark joys are here: the compound of squashy creatures and heavy machinery, the wide, open-ended rictus of a toothy smile, and the great Parkian gulp."
244,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"It coaxes you to laugh and cry, flatters your intelligence, and practically guarantees a cheap night out: at dinner afterward, no one's going to be ordering anything but salad."
245,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,It's a warm-hearted and amusing entertainment that your children will enjoy.
246,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Chickens are inherently funny, like nature's idea of a very practical joke. Park and Lord have just improved the old rubber chicken gag, making it movable, turning it into something closer to who we are and what we know as humans."
247,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,Chicken Run is a charmingly conceived entertainment. But it's a little bit twee.
248,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,What gives this movie its oddly strong grip on a viewer's heart is a physical tenderness inseparable from the nature of claymation.
249,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"The claymation comedy Chicken Run is eggsactly what the doctor ordered. It's a witty, high-spirited adventure that will appeal to moviegoers of all ages. Call it chicken soup for the funny bone."
250,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"The first feature film from England's Aardman Animation, and the first truly terrific film to be released by DreamWorks."
251,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Most of the time Chicken Run entertains, instructs, involves and enchants."
252,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,Run to Chicken Run. This clay-animation comedy is the most entertaining animal story since Babe.
253,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"The film is brilliantly voiced across the board, with special notice to Mel Gibson as Rocky and Julia Sawalha as Ginger."
254,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"The sly, sardonic flight of fancy known as Chicken Run is a delightful epic of fowl deeds, quests for freedom and poultry heroics from the off-kilter English cartoon house, Aardman Animation."
255,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Like Wallace & Gromit, it's a paean to British eccentricity, equal parts cluelessness and hopefulness, full of English slang and dry Brit humor."
256,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Indeed, it's the best movie comedy to come out of England since Monty Python packed up the circus."
257,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Chicken Run contains some gorgeous, destined-to-be-classic set pieces, and this is where the Aardman production team flex their animation muscles."
258,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"It's nothing less than a stop-motion tour de force, bursting with charm, humor, invention and eye-popping mise en scene."
259,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"With its winking homages to films like Stalag 17 and The Great Escape, Run is visually inventive, its characters plump with personality and, for a bunch of chickens, ever so brave."
260,chicken_run,audience,4.0,n,"The voice acting is great, jokes smart, and great action sequences.  The movie uses animals as surrogates for our hopes and fears with the chickens running through one failed escape after another."
261,chicken_run,audience,3.5,n,"An amusing claymation-style stop-motion movie (similar to ""Wallace & Gromit"") about friendship, helping others in need and teamwork. With slapstick-style comedy, the film is fun for parents as well as kids."
262,chicken_run,audience,5.0,n,"Truly one of the defining cinematic works of our time—and no, this isn't some joke review.  Aardman carries the entirety of the claymation genre on its back, and rightly so.  The voice acting, the jokes, the plot, the SUBTEXT (yes, you heard me right, a G RATED MOVIE has a deeper subtext)...it's just stunning."
263,chicken_run,audience,2.0,p,something about this movie just makes me not like it
264,chicken_run,audience,5.0,n,"I used to watch it when I was a child. After 15 years, this movie is still fresh and enjoyable. The stop motion is amazing. Moreover, i found out this is an ecological and environmental reinterpretation of the Holocaust and it made me appreciate the movie even more"
265,chicken_run,audience,3.5,n,Clever story and funny to watch
266,chicken_run,audience,3.0,n,"While Chicken Run has a great animation style and compelling characters, the plot of the film was too generic and cliche for me."
267,chicken_run,audience,2.0,p,"I guess I'm part of the minority who isn't that impressed with the animation. The story is interesting and I get the holocaust parallels. But it just didn't keep my interest, even with the short run-time."
268,chicken_run,audience,3.0,n,"On one side we have chickens as symbols for humanity.
On the other side we have fried chicken, baked chicken, pineapple chicken, lemon chicken, coconut chicken, pepper chicken, chicken soup, chicken stew, chicken salad, chicken and potatoes, chicken burgers, chicken sandwich and chicken parmesan.
You get the idea."
269,chicken_run,audience,5.0,n,"This movie was already way ahead of it's time back when it was released. It's not the story of ""an america  rooster who falls in love with a British chicken"", it is literally the story of a group of women enslaved workers joining forces to escape a Nazi working camp
Spoilers:
This movie has simply amazing dynamics between women, be it friendship, disagreement, protection, union, hopelessness... and the story of their visionary leader, willing to sacrifice herself so that those she lead could experience freedom. Her friendship with Mac, a woman engineer, is heartwarming especially when they see the fruit of all their hard work: their plane is ready.
Rocky is your regular selfish overconfident man, that is, until his character development brings him to be honest, to not turn a blind eye to those suffering around him, to care, and ultimately to find the courage and dignity to join the chickens' cause. Over his character development, he also finally becomes worthy of the amazing woman (or hen) Ginger is."

275,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"The Dark Knight managed to capture something complex and instinctive about the ""war on terror"" era."
276,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"A masterpiece. Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight is not only one of the greatest comic book movies you'll ever see, but also one of the best films of all-time."
277,the_dark_knight,critics,rotten,n,It seems almost cruel to take beloved child archetypes and turn them into projections for adult angst.
278,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"Heath Ledger gives one of the best performances of the last twenty years. When you watch his take on the Joker, it's one of complete surprise and mystery. It's frightening with how chaotic and mischievous he makes him."
279,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"Ledger's performance alone is good enough to make The Dark Knight a very good movie, but fortunately this is a film with even more than that -- making it the not just the best film of the summer, but one of the best films of the year."
280,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,The Dark Knight represents a masterpiece in filmmaking as Christopher Nolan takes the Batman Begins sequel to an entirely new level.
281,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,The definitive movie of its genre and the best Batman film to date
282,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,Heath Ledger is great.
283,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"The movie's a real neo-noir all right, wallowing in darkness, thrilled with how bad we are, and getting such a kick out of our impending doom it cheers you right up."
284,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"Not just a perfect comic book movie, not just a perfect Batman movie, but darn-near a perfect movie, full stop."
285,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"A film is only as good as its villain. By that standard, The Dark Knight achieves true greatness."
286,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"The Dark Knight always ought to be played on the biggest screen possible, and played loud, like a Led Zepplin song. Director Christopher Nolans' skyscapes, the helicopter shots and views from the 200th floor, are IMAX at its best."
287,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"It might not be the most fun superhero movie ever made, but it's certainly the most mature, complex and intriguing of them all. [Full review in Spanish]"
288,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"The Dark Knight may not supply a happy ending, but there is a feeling of exhilaration as Batman rides off from the pursuing cops, and the realization that this is another big step forward for comic book movies."
289,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,The action sequences are like being injected with a shot of adrenalin straight into the heart.
290,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,n,A cinematic masterpiece about the war against terror and definitely the most accurate Batman movie vibe ever made
291,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,n,"My favorite of the trilogy, the plot is very good, heath ledger portrayed a unsettling, psychotic villain, which is the best joker performance yet. The interrogation scene is just amazing. This is one of the best batman films, Christopher Nolan did a very good job on this film"
292,the_dark_knight,audience,4.5,n,This is the best movie in the trilogy. Ledger brings this home offering the best characterization of the Joker. Sometimes Ledger makes the Joker legit scary. Something I haven't experienced before.
293,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,n,"It's a perfect movie. Everything is well done, the acting is all very good, the special effects adequate, a great direction from Nolan, all the character arcs well done and a joker who always steals the show. Side by Side with Spider-Man 2 in terms of best super hero film (my opinion). (10/10)"
294,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,n,"While ""Batman Begins"" laid the cinematic groundwork for a gritty narrative on the Caped Crusader, this movie miraculously exceeds its predecessor by highlighting the moral dilemma of vigilantism, accompanied with many twists and turns. The titular protagonist exhibits enough screen time of brains and brawn, but it is Ledger's portrayal of the Joker that steals the show as he constantly pushes the hero to his limits, raising the stakes in a battle between order versus chaos. Even though the fight choreography is arguably mediocre, I appreciate the more realistic direction as intended. ""The Dark Knight"" remains the gold standard for the superhero genre."
295,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,n,One of the best Comic book movies Ever
296,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,n,This might just be my favorite superhero movie. It’s a masterpiece
297,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,n,Easily the best comic book adaptation of my generation. Outstanding!!!
298,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,n,"Literally the best super hero movie ever made, it ticks all the boxes. I will watch it time and time again"
299,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,n,Till now is the greatest superhero movie

302,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,"...a sumptuous, haunting love story with moments of dynamism..."
303,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,"Once in a while there is a work of art so specific, so complex, so new in its oldness and old in its newness, that it moves the craft, our craft, to another level of seeing."
304,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,"While it says much about the female gaze - both as painter and painted, watcher and watched - that doesn't stop it from sagging in its final act."
305,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,"[A] deconstruction of the male gaze, bringing forth a new lens through which to view women's agency and historic contributions to art... wrapped in a gentle yet painful love story."
306,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,"Unfolds as a liquid painting, shades of honey, earth, and time, with a soundtrack burning off all that is unnecessary."
307,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,The movie is a deeply affecting memory piece where even present-tense pleasure is edged with sadness and regret.
308,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,"Portrait of a Lady on Fire is a brilliant and visually stunning meditation on the meaning of art and love, as well as the choices we make as artists and lovers."
309,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,"In a film filled with arresting images, none is better than its final shot. Haunting and raw."
310,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,"Through this acceptance of women's flaws, the most important message of the film becomes judgement is faulty, fleeting, and unsustainable, while love, even neglected and unfed, lives on for a lifetime."
311,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,Few of us have figured out how to upend over a century of defining and reinforcing what cinema is. Sciamma did it.
312,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,"Portrait of a Lady on Fire is set 260 years in the past, but the sentiments of its story are extremely modern. It's also as great, if not better, than any movie with a male focus, and continued proof that women's voices deserve to be heard."
313,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,"There is a joyful vivrancy about the film. They fully accept their fate, laid out by period and society. Yet they enjoy their few days together and remember it forever. It's super life affirming and uplifting, rather than sad."
314,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,"With gorgeous cinematography, [and] a beautiful script that shows off the French language at its very best...Céline Sciamma's new film is easily one of the best of the year."
315,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,"It's high art to the highest degree, a movie that is great now, will be great in 50 years, will be great in 150 years."
316,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,"There's almost no single moment in Portrait of a Lady on Fire that couldn't be captured, mounted, and hung on a wall as high art."
317,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,"There are many great acting moments in this film, but you should especially savor the final shot, the long close-up of Haenel in profile. Put simply, it's why we go to the movies."
318,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,"Metaphorical and melancholic, Céline Sciamma's masterpiece is a slow burn period romance that takes its time to draw you in. But once it does, there's no looking back."
319,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,[Sciamma] frames Marianne and Héloïse's developing relationship with such exquisite skill that almost every detail throbs with meaning and emotion.
320,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,audience,5.0,n,One of my all time favorites. Very cute real lesbian period drama. It's the pining! The yearning!
321,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,audience,5.0,n,"Céline Sciamma creates a beautifully reminiscent masterpiece, with subtle but powerful performances, meaningful dialogue, and enthralling camera work. It praises simple, and patient filmmaking, that ends with an astoundingly profound finale."
322,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,audience,5.0,n,Anyone who's lived has experienced pieces of this movie. And that last shot... good grief.
323,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,audience,4.5,n,Thoroughly enjoyed this deeply moving film.
324,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,audience,5.0,n,Triste com Tesão!!!!
325,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,audience,5.0,n,"I love the silent romance, suffocating grief, endless sadness of the movie"
326,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,audience,5.0,n,"What an amazing sapphic period piece. The film is an incredible portrayal of two beautifully complex characters who find themselves hesitant in admitting their feelings for one another.

The creative choices—like there being no male characters featured in the bulk of the movie—make this piece all the better. Portrait of a Lady of Fire is a must-watch."
327,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,audience,5.0,n,"Romance in its greatest splendor. Portraited it in a cinematography that every single shot can be a gorgeous painting. Every single aspect feels the most genuine and natural that I've ever seen in a love film; the acting, directing, script, cinematography and editing are summarized in a simple word, BEAUTY."
328,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,audience,5.0,n,"OH MY GOD, this movie. GORGEOUS. Just watch it. I don't even know what to say other than WATCH IT NOW."
329,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,audience,4.5,n,"Telling the story of an intoxicating affair between two 18th century women, Céline Sciamma directs Noémie Merlant and Adèle Haenel in this passionate drama. After premiering at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, the film went on to win the Queer Palm and Best Screenplay. The film also received nominations for nine César Awards and a BAFTA Film Award. 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire' also marks the third collaboration between Haenel and Sciamma, both previously working on the 2007 drama 'Water Lillies' and the short film 'Pauline'.

Set on an isolated island in Brittany, a young painter, Marianne (Noémie Merlant),  is tasked to paint a wedding portrait of Héloïse (Adèle Haenel) without her knowledge. Marianne must discreetly observe her model as she works under the illusion of companionship. But as feelings between the two women flourish, an ardent romance begins between the two women.

Shot in 7k, nearly every shot in the film resembles a painting. Claire Mathon makes sure none of the lighting comes off too harsh and does a splendid job of making the light seem natural in both exterior and interior shots. The smooth camera movements help immerse the viewer in the scene as the camera follows the character and the lack of cuts within these shots aids the audience in feeling like they're watching each sequence as it unfolds. Diegetic sound also plays a role in drawing in the viewer.  Mixed with the absence of a score, it helps the viewer to feel like they're right there with Marianne and Héloïse. Sciamma stated the reason the film lacks a score is so that viewers can be obsessed with the rhythm of each scene in both the body movements and the camera.

Throughout the film, both women each have a main outfit. Marianne wears a refined, red dress, a colour that directly opposes Héloïse's vibrant green dress. Both fabric-heavy garments are perfectly juxtapositioned in terms of colour and style; each representing the character's personality. As well as being shot in an 18th-century castle, the costumes emphasise the authenticity of the film. Noémie Merlant and Adèle Haenel both give incredible performances across the film. Luàna Bajrami gives a great performance as the housemaid whom Héloïse and Marianne help to get an abortion.

Sciamma does a great job bringing delicate themes to the forefront of 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire', including abortion and arranged marriage, both of which were issues that women faced in the 18th century. These sensitive themes are handled with care and aren't glorified by the director. The story of Orpheus and Eurydice also holds some importance to the story. For example, both women choose the memory of each other and when Marianne leaves Héloïse, Héloïse asks Marianne to turn around, like how Eurydice asks Orpheus to turn around. 

Something viewers might notice is the distinct lack of men in the film, the few scenes that feature male characters, they're either barely focused on or purposely have their back turned to the camera, supporting the fact that the film is a love letter to the female gaze. Sciamma doesn't oversexualize the relationship between these two women, and any nudity featured feels incredibly natural. Viewers will pick up on the suggestive imagery lightly scattered through the film, the most obvious one being the scene in which an armpit is made to look like a piece of the female anatomy.

Overall, 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire' is an erotic, sensual love story between two women in a short-lived affair. Sciamma brings viewers a story that delves into the exploration of love and its inevitable departure. Films that have a resemblance to 'POALOF', in terms of its central love story include the 2017 drama 'Disobediance' and Francis Lee's 2019 feature 'Ammonite'. Helmed by brilliant performances and artistic cinematography, the film is a visually stunning feature that spans over 120 minutes."
330,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,An impressive technical achievement. [Full review in Spanish]
331,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The truth is that the film is presented as entertainment, but not so naively. [Full review in Spanish]"
332,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Only half a good movie. When mucking around with unfunny body-swap nonsense, it falls flat. When pondering the deep passions that give us reasons to live, it excels."
333,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"It's comedic, moving and the animation is pristine. [But] [i]t's like animation meets Get Out, meets Magical Negro."
334,soul_2020,critics,rotten,n,I wish the film focused on and channeled more of its energy into that relationship and Joe's own life rather than his bump-in with 22.
335,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Soul [is] a wildly ambitious, sometimes brilliant, gorgeously animated (in every sense of the word) film, all while breaking one of Disney/Pixar's biggest glass ceilings: an animated film featuring a Black lead character."
336,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,[Soul] opens as a metaphysical theme park and morphs into a slapstick body-swap comedy ... It's a quietly joyous send-off to a relentlessly bleak year.
337,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,It's solid Pixar working their magic with a couple rough spots but nothing to truly sour the experience.
338,soul_2020,critics,rotten,n,"Soul cannot make its discrete parts work as a whole of something when it feels like it is stuck in its own ""Great Before""."
339,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"With a simple, yet life-altering moral, wrapped in the greatness that we now expect from Pixar, it's no surprise as to why Soul is achieving a momentous amount of awards, while simultaneously being a perfect family voyage."
340,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,An animated film that infects me when it tackles with sensitivity and grace a rather clever concept that celebrates the value of human life. [Full review in Spanish]
341,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Even if the story hits too many familiar beats to completely succeed, the animation is absolutely stunning."
342,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,The film beautifully illustrates the communion of life's spark and human purpose. [Full Review in Spanish]
343,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,The shape-shifting keeps Soul light on its feet and keeps your eyes wide open.
344,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"An animated masterpiece about a soul's adventure that will get you thinking and talking about the life and the afterlife, your passions and purpose, and the spark that sets it all going."
345,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,The film's multilayered charms - a Pixar hallmark - seamlessly blend heart and humor in a package that parents will be able to enjoy alongside their kids.
346,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,Directors Pete Docter and Kemp Powers manage to land these [existential] ideas. [Full review in Spanish]
347,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"A smart, tender and contemplative piece of stunning filmmaking all on its own terms."
348,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"This may be Pixar's most 'adult' film, in terms of its themes, its mostly middle-aged characters, its sometimes experimental and -- yes -- jazzy animation (heaven is run by characters who are nothing but squiggly lines), and its soundtrack."
349,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"With its fragmented narrative, it feels almost like a shorts collection jazz riff on the theme of existence and metaphysics, plus quite a few of the jokes feel extremely American-specific and won't translate well for international audiences."
350,soul_2020,audience,5.0,n,"I loved the movie, the animation, the story's creativity and mainly because they used Jazz as the main character's musical taste"
351,soul_2020,audience,5.0,n,The best movie of all time!
352,soul_2020,audience,4.0,n,"A perfectly crafted universe animated in best Pixar traditions lets the story dive deep into a metaphysical realm of before- and after-life. There are some beautiful and well thought ideas and concepts, although it is hard to say that all of them are aligned well enough to represent a coherent system.
Otherwise it is a perfect family story packed in a great music box and the best animation and visual effects imaginable."
353,soul_2020,audience,3.5,n,"The film is full of surprises and shows the extremely pronounced creativity of the makers of Pixar. The film raises exciting questions, not all of which are unfortunately answered. Especially the middle part of the film stretches a bit in length. I would have liked to see more of the Great Before. And especially the topic of jazz music me off, because the music is very exhausting, especially when it accompanies you throughout the film. The end was really disappointing for me. It seems like Pixar didn't dare to let the character die, but that would have rounded off the movie perfectly for me. All in all entertaining, but not a new masterpiece from Pixar."
354,soul_2020,audience,3.0,n,Like the concept and especially the message is great. But again we have a POC character that's human for like 5 min of the movie.
355,soul_2020,audience,5.0,n,"Don't make the mistake of thinking this is a ""kids' movie"" or some sort of musical as the trailers' may lead you to believe. It's funny, cute, and thought provoking. And literally any age can enjoy it. Pixar delivers another masterpiece."
356,soul_2020,audience,3.0,n,"Not one of the better Pixar films, but somewhat interesting.  It is a bit like Inside Out, but more to it.  Typical of Disney Pixar it is a feel good movie with some decent music and crazy fantasy adventure."
357,soul_2020,audience,4.5,n,"A breath of fresh air for all animated films. Youth and adults alike can revel in Soul's powerful message. A template that should be saved for the future, and a benchmark for all forthcoming cartoon fare."
358,soul_2020,audience,5.0,n,"Soul is worth every ounce in Gold. The movie has a very charismatic approach towards being alive. The characters perfectly sum up the perspective of someone who lost their meaning of life. It is very vivid, it is very lively. Everyone should definitely watch Soul atleast once, and especially when they aren't sure of their purpose to live. It sets a tone for looking ahead. Simply amazing!"
359,soul_2020,audience,5.0,n,"This movie hits every box on my list that is needed for a what a perfect movie should be. The animation is beautiful, the actor do an amazing job bringing these character to life, and the message is simple and sweet, but powerful that will affect everyone trying to figure out what they want to do in life."
360,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Gashi's sturdy, no-nonsense portrayal of a sturdy, no-nonsense woman doesn't traffic in cheap inspiration and neither does Basholli's film."
361,hive,critics,fresh,p,"As a statement -- a universal statement -- on how women are so often treated as chattel, or worse, Basholli has constructed something every bit as inspiring as it is powerful."
362,hive,critics,fresh,p,Rarely does a film win over its audience with such effortless execution.
363,hive,critics,fresh,p,Yllka Gashi's portrayal of Hoti is excellently controlled...
364,hive,critics,fresh,p,Anchored by Gashi's quietly determined performance as the heroine-a real person whose company now employs 50 people-Hive is itself restrained but powerful...
365,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Hive is a touching, inspiring drama about the power of sisterhood, filled with fine performances, particularly by star Yllka Gashi, and an insightful glimpse into another culture."
366,hive,critics,fresh,p,"[Writer/director Blerta] Basholli has given us a vivid portrait, not only of one woman's real life struggle to put food on the table but also to transcend gender and cultural bias."
367,hive,critics,fresh,p,"A simple story told without flourish, Hive reminds us that necessity not only can breed invention but also the courage required to keep from going under."
368,hive,critics,fresh,p,It's based on a true story of feminist defiance and healing that counts as one of the more affecting tales of recovery to come from the conflict...
369,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Basholli's film is a spare and unsparing portrait of a survivor who refuses to bend to ancient traditions. As storytelling, this is as good as it gets."
370,hive,critics,fresh,p,It's an observant film that buzzes in anger like bees seem to do in a hive.
371,hive,critics,fresh,p,Though the film is a gorgeously realized dramatization...it can't help but feel detached from the actual war crimes that have still largely gone unaccounted for.
372,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Based on true events, the dramatic film Hive takes place in Kosovo in the 2000s, but it speaks to universal experiences of women who overcome discrimination and misogyny to become business entrepreneurs."
373,hive,critics,fresh,p,The effects of political unrest in postwar Kosovo are felt throughout this bittersweet and quietly perceptive story of healing and humanity in the face of tragedy.
374,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Though it doesn't break new ground, Hive still reminds one how urgently significant it is to honor the unique fighting spirit of women."
375,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Somewhere behind ""Hive,"" I think, you can hear the far-off cry of Euripides' ""The Trojan Women""..."
376,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Hive is ... quietly, unaffectedly inspiring in its simple gestures ... as well as its broader implications..."
377,hive,critics,fresh,p,"""Hive"" seizes and holds your interest simply through the drama created by sympathetic characters trying to surmount awful, unfair hurdles."
378,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Hjve unfolds as a kind of modern folklore. Sentimentality is traded for the undistorted reflection of a culture in a certain time and place, when a woman becomes the life-sized hero who ushers a community towards change."
379,hive,critics,fresh,p,"What Basholli has made is a thoughtful, humanistic exploration of the fortitude needed to summon hope in a time and place resigned to hopelessness."
380,hive,audience,5.0,n,"Based on true story, great movie. Must see!"
381,hive,audience,5.0,n,This is the best movie with the best theme I have ever seen.
382,hive,audience,5.0,n,"Forceful, powerful, and hauntingly honest. The honesty in capturing a woman's plight even when she's fighting for others was second to none."
383,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"It's the greatest comedy - and funniest movie - of all time. ... But, as with most of Chaplin's other films, it'll also make you cry your eyes out."
384,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Several high spots stand out as notable examples of Chaplin's expert timing of slapstick burlesque, scenes that are apt to make the spectator shed tears from the strain of laughter."
385,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"The sequence in which the modern mechanical feeder for workers is introduced is a gem of comedy invention. It is one of the funniest episodes, and certainly the most ingenious."
386,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,There are reminders of every Chaplin picture that was ever made all through Modern Times and there are enough brand new comic inventions to explain why Charlie takes such a long time between pictures and why they are so superlatively worth waiting for.
387,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"What most amazes you about Modern Times, is the fact that, in this day of superfine sound films, it says everything without saying anything."
388,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"In many ways Modern Times is old-fashioned film comedy, but it is the kind of comedy which has made millions of people laugh all over the world and which has won Mr. Chaplin the great affection and love."
389,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"While he has borrowed a few symbolic touches from the Russian picture makers, there is nothing of real significance in Chaplin s work except his earnest desire, and his really great ability, to entertain."
390,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Modern Times, underneath its farce, is a curiously passionate jibe at the herd-instincts and herd clangour of a machine age."
391,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"The monotony of this Job ""gets"" Charlie and he runs wild, attacking everything and everybody in view with his brandished wrenches in one of the funniest scenes ever filmed."
392,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Miss Goddard put us in mind more of a ballet dancer in portraying her role than a screen player, which fits in, on the whole, rather well with Chaplin's style. She's attractive and has charm."
393,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"It is episodically hilarious but never consistently so, and you come away from the Penn remembering, not so much the heroic Chaplinesque figure as a nut-and-bolt factory, a red flag, a feeding machine and a song."
394,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"It doesn't seem possible to inject a large quantity of heart appeal in a heavily gagged-up comedy but Chaplin does it. That's Chaplin's forte, and that's what distinguishes his comedies from all others."
395,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,Chaplin exhibits his amazing versatility in the fast-forgotten art of pantomime and makes you laugh when you had perhaps expected to cry.
396,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Remaining silent, Charlie is more eloquent in pantomime than many other comedians are with the added use of spoken words. Poking gentle fun at mechanized industry, Charlie is comic indeed."
397,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Five years absence from the screen has not diminished Chaplin's art. In his usual fashion, he can provoke laughs or tears, and keep the audience absorbed in whatever he is doing."
398,modern_times,critics,rotten,n,"What begins as a rather heavy lampooning gets lost in a series of first-rate slapstick acts and ends up as an idyll. Modern Tunes is, of course, funny picture; it Is also a very disappointing one."
399,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Chaplin [has] returned to basic fundamentals in story construction, coupling with it an ironic poke or two at the System, as constituted today, and combined with that his great talent in his first screen appearance since City Lights."
400,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,There are many sequences which will become famous. The philosophy is evident. It is clear that Chaplin's answer to modern times is that if the individual does not conform he is taken away in a van to prison or to hospital.
401,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"The full revelation of [Paulette Goddard] is not to be detected in this production, but there is unusual promise in her work -- perhaps more than in the instance of any other Chaplin leading woman."
402,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,".Many of the situations are slapstick and many of a higher order, some quite amusing and a few hilarious."
403,modern_times,audience,1.0,p,20% rating. Didn't laugh as much as I wished.
404,modern_times,audience,5.0,n,esta película es totalmente divertida que te va a dejar escapar una risa
405,modern_times,audience,2.5,p,"I mean its typical Chaplin. I find his humor mostly predictable and the original annoying steve urkel. He is not really my cup of tea. In this day and age, I prefer more intellect with my humor, although this keeps you somewhat entertained. I liked seeing how the old department stores were organized and how police used to wander the streets. I also liked seeing the inappropriate coke scene and when they talk about ""darkies"" this people back in the day had no chill. Cant believe this is what people looked forward to for entertainment, the bar was not very high. This wasn't his best film I'm afraid and I don't like slapstick to begin with."
406,modern_times,audience,5.0,n,Chaplin Brings his slapstick comedy Genius to his Timeless as his beloved Character The Tramp and goes from Working in a factory to jail then to a waiter and the along the way the results are every time hilarious results in this Slient pre code masterpiece from one of the masters filmmakers of all time
407,modern_times,audience,4.0,n,"Class on precarious jobs and how to face it, more valid today than 85 years ago."
408,modern_times,audience,2.5,p,"I think it's safe to say that I'm just not a big fan of Charlie Chaplin. As of writing this review, I've seen The Great Dictator, City Lights and, earlier today, Modern Times. The latter is a noted criticism of industrialisation and its effect on humanity, but most of the film is, unsurprisingly, The Tramp spending long stretches of time falling over, bumping into things and being so gosh darned loveable that you just wanna pick him up and take him home. It felt like the least funny and least substantial of the 3 films, with a scattershot plot and sporadic social commentary. This might have been intentional, as this was to be The Tramp's final cinematic outing, and Chaplin wanted him to go out doing what he had become famous for. It does end on an organically positive note, and if Chaplin's style of comedy appeals to you, then Modern Times should be on your watchlist. But I wasn't won over by its message or its content."
409,modern_times,audience,5.0,n,I love Modern Times so much I came back for the second showing! See my earlier post.
410,modern_times,audience,5.0,n,"Charlie is mesmerizing. Modern Times is one of my favorite films. Its funny and poignant, a timeless classic as relevant today as it always was. This was the Little Tramps last appearance and Charlies last silent film. There is some dialogue as well as sound effects and a brilliant score but Charlie himself doesnt speak. We do hear his voice, however, at the end!"
411,modern_times,audience,5.0,n,Charlie Chapman's talents mesmerize.
412,modern_times,audience,4.5,n,"Modern Times is unexpectedly hilarous. Somehow the 30s humor still works. The story is related in a very good way, and the mix between sound and silence is just incredible.
Modern Times is one of the most important films in history, uniting silent and sound movies, but more important, it is a really good film."

429,up,critics,fresh,p,Up is breathtaking in its imaginative detail and astonishing in its emotional range.
430,up,critics,fresh,p,I challenge you not to tear up.
431,up,critics,fresh,p,The first 10 minutes of Pixar's fantastical 3-D animated adventure Up are a sublime testimonial to the purity and magic of the cinema. I know because I was a sobbing basket case by Minute 11.

436,up,audience,4.0,n,Es buena por su inicio de la vida de Carl y Ellie que es de lo mas memorable y lloras y te enseña a dejar ir a alguien que murio y quedarte con sus momentos de felicidad pero el resto de la película es mediocre pero me gustan los personajes
437,up,audience,4.0,n,"An elderly gentleman finally gets to go on an adventure to Paradise Falls. As many people have already said, the first 11:30 of this movie is fantastic! Once again Pixar displays their ability to tell a great story without using a word. Post that eleven and a half minute mark the film doesn't live up to that opening, it isn't bad, just not as great. The voice acting is well done, but no real standouts. The animation from Pixar is again terrific. This film succeeds in invoking a sense of awe, adventure, comedy and in the end will warm your heart. Highly recommended movie, go check it out!"
438,up,audience,4.0,n,One of the few times I've been in a movie theater where it went totally silent. That beginning montage starts so happy and ends so heartbreaking all with the same tune just slowly morphing into a slower more somber version was brilliant. All you could hear in that silence of the theater was sniffling. A wonderful heartwarming tale of the grouchy old man and the enthusiastic young kid meshed so well together. The only thing I didn't like was that it kind of dragged in the middle.
439,up,audience,4.0,n,"A movie that a lot of people hold it on high regards but I have never had that feeling. Yes, the opening scene is phenomenal and the humor is good and emotions are flourished  like any other Pixar film but I kind off disconnected with it sometimes but that's just my personal opinion."
440,up,audience,4.0,n,Once again pixar delivers A touching movie that will tug at the heart strings there is plenty of deep moments and humor mixed in Russell and mr. Fredricksen have a good relationship its no finding nemo or toy story but still has it where it counts

443,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Despite the unexplained language barriers or farfetched plot, this delightfully delicious foray into the unimaginable never becomes preachy or immature."
444,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"This is a film about a rat who becomes a chef in Paris. But it's so much more than that. It's about what a great artist can be, where a great artist can come from, it's about food and how to savour it."
445,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"A love letter to Paris, a valentine to the fine art of cooking, and a gift to film fans of all ages."
446,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,A delectable treat that represents the finest qualities in animation and American cinema.
447,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,Has great vocal performances throughout and is about a character figuring out where they belong and finally being accepted there. I love it!
448,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"That is the (...) imperative message of Ratatouille. Everyone is not an artist, but anyone could be an artist. Because, as living creatures, it is simply what we do."
449,ratatouille,critics,rotten,n,"The studio's latest effort offers beautiful and strikingly realistic animation, but the flawed concept should have been scrapped..."
450,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"I won't spoil the broth, but suffice to say Ratatouille is a bursting with bright flavors, some spice, and deep warmth that settles in your belly and satisfies body and soul."
451,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"There is so much to enjoy and celebrate here, Ratatouille deserves more than a review: it could (and probably will) inspire books about creativity and good taste."
452,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Ratatouille was written and directed by Brad Bird, the guy behind The Incredibles, and while his new movie isn't as brainy as that one, it has lots of lovely touches to appeal to parents as well as kids."
453,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Ratatouille is a triumph that not only pays tribute to the spirit of discovery, but revels in the fun of making a few of its own."
454,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"And there's Remy himself, voiced by irreverent comic Patton Oswalt. Yes, he's a rat, and a pantless one at that, but he's a charming rat."
455,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,The latest from Pixar and Oscar winning writer-director Brad Bird is a fabulously enjoyable parable about the pursuit of excellence and rising above the preconceptions of others.
456,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"It's not just the best animated film this year, it's the best animated film to come out of the U.S. since Bird's last effort, The Incredibles."
457,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Like the snooty restaurant critic Anton Ego (voiced by Peter O'Toole), we enter Ratatouille thinking we've tasted it all, and we leave hoping for seconds."
458,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,It's a great programme for all the family.
459,ratatouille,critics,rotten,n,It's not my favourite Pixar film.
460,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"No restaurant has ever benefited from placing rats in a recipe, but the digital wizards in Pixar's kitchen have cooked up a winning peasant dish in Ratatouille."
461,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Ratatouille is a wonderful, wistful comedy, and a sparkling return to form for the computer animation studio Pixar after last year's lacklustre Cars."
462,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"As in his previous films, Bird offers up a story with substance."

465,ratatouille,audience,5.0,n,This film is the definition of a masterpiece
466,ratatouille,audience,5.0,n,"My favorite movie of all time, very compelling and very calming basically memorized every scene."
467,ratatouille,audience,4.5,n,i love how this movie tells that food can hug people when they need
468,ratatouille,audience,5.0,n,"One of Pixar's best movies! Remy, a rat, is an aspiring chef and finds a way to realize his dream in Paris. As with every film, Pixar ups the game in animation. The water, fire effects are great as is the movement of the rat characters. The human characters are stylized, but believable in a cartoonish way. Brad Bird does an amazing job as director/writer and crafts an excellent story. Patton Oswalt is great as Remy and Peter O'Toole is a perfect cast as Anton Ego. The writing is also well done, Ego's review near the end of the movie is a highlight. An amazing film, go see it!"
469,ratatouille,audience,4.0,n,Very well made and felt very artistic and didn't care to be made for a child audience and go all kidish. It even went into a partial emotional route which was a well surprise. Rating A-
470,ratatouille,audience,3.0,n,Kinda weird they let the rats run the kitchen but you do you I guess...
471,ratatouille,audience,4.0,n,"One of the best Pixar movies ever made, Brad Bird is an amazing director, the movie can be enjoyable for all ages."
472,ratatouille,audience,5.0,n,This movie is absolutely brilliant on every conceivable level. Brad Bird proves again that he is one of the top animated movie directors. The story of the unlikely hero is incredible and written with great purpose. The visuals in this movie are breathtaking. Remy's first sight of Paris is one of the most beautiful animated movie shots ever and the ending monologue from Anton Ego and the way it is presented is the cherry on top of this breathtaking and incredible film.
473,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,Pixar continues to set the standards for which all other animation projects attempt to reach.
474,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,"[G]ood writing, great gags, superior animation, perfect casting, over the top energy and cuteness, and above-all - characters guaranteed to make Disney's coffers go ""ch-ching"" with holiday toy buying!"
475,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,A timeless toon tale.
476,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,It's a delight.

478,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,"It's a terrific piece of work: smart, inventive and executed with state-of-the-art finesse."
479,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,"It's funny, the characters are endearing, the monster world is cleverly developed, and the Pixar gang really has fun with this one."
480,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,Remains as wonderful and remarkably charming as it was when it was first released.
481,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,[A] fixedly sweet bedtime story and exercise in imaginative possibility.
482,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,"...the movie becomes a giddy, kiddie inversion of time and space."
483,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,"[I] really don't see the point of paying extra for children under eight. Their eyes are still developing, their noses are still small for slippery glasses, and... isn't a trip to the pictures enough for them in any case?"
484,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,"If anything, it improves with age."
485,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,Monsters displays wonderful imagination which makes it worth reliving in an extra dimension - particularly the energetic chase scene along a conveyor belt of doors.
486,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,Pixar's soaringly lovely fourth feature ...
487,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,"[An] exciting, imaginative and very likable adventure."
488,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,"Despite its eternal message about physical differences and the importance of love over fear of the unknown, Monsters, Inc primarily remains an ambitious concept film."
489,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,"It's in the visuals that 'Monsters Inc' comes to life, from the jazzy, Norman McLaren influenced opening to the hilarious, shakycam amateur-dramatic recap over the closing credits."
490,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,"Another chance to see Pixar's most dazzling premise, now spruced up with a third dimension."
491,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,"Now in 3D, the filmmakers have created a wonderful reality - the reality of Monstropolis, which like the worlds of Oz and Pleasantville, whisk us far, far away on a magic carpet of fantasy"
492,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,"A shrewdly timed reminder of Pixar's early, heady days, when the animation powerhouse could do no wrong."
493,monsters_inc,audience,5.0,n,"Such a classic plus Mike and Sully are one of the best duos ever to be put on screen, up there with Woody and Buzz. All time classic!"
494,monsters_inc,audience,5.0,n,"Película ESPECTACULAR. Una trama que te mantiene pegado al televisor, unos personajes MUY bien desarrollados y profundos, y un universo súper interesante de explorar y que le genera a uno una curiosidad genuina sobre el funcionamiento de la sociedad. Respecto a.... AHHHHHH....¡¡¡UN NIÑO FLOTÓ SOBRE MÍ Y VOLÓ UN AUTO CON SU RASHO LASER!!!"
495,monsters_inc,audience,4.5,n,"The same great mixture of heart, humor, and technical wizardry that made A Bug's Life and Toy Story into instant classics.  It's delightful and should be the textbook definition of adorable.  Like Jim Henson who decided to make his Sesame Street characters monsters so kids would not be afraid of monsters again, the people behind Monsters, Inc. have created monsters that even the shyest child will find unscary.  In fact, kids may decide multiple heads, removable eyes, and hair made from snakes are kind of cute."
496,monsters_inc,audience,4.5,n,Una de las mejores películas de Pixar
497,monsters_inc,audience,5.0,n,"I have never had a monster before, and I truly wish I did so I could understand this film more"
498,monsters_inc,audience,5.0,n,I think that this movie has a amazing story about how you should love some one while you have them before they are gone forever. I also think it is a great Disney movie
499,monsters_inc,audience,4.0,n,"In this Pixar film, two monsters named Mike and Sully must protect a young human girl from an evil plot. In typical Pixar fashion they really up their game in the animation department with each film. In this movie you can see their improvement in the textures, specifically Sully's hair and their snow animation. The story here is great and the relationship between Sully and Boo, the young human girl, is the heart of the film. Randell, the antagonist, is voiced well by Steve Buscemi and is a threatening presence throughout the film. The very last scene of the movie always leaves me with the warm-fuzzies. Highly recommend you check this movie out!"
500,monsters_inc,audience,4.5,n,"For 2001:

PIXAR's fourth animated entry continued to prove the studio's passion for storytelling resonating with audiences 
'Monsters Inc' asks the question what if monsters were actually real and hid in our closets, not only that but actually lived in their own world working for a living?
Actors Billy Crystal and John Goodman play Sully and Mike, two best friends who work at a company called Monsters, Inc that specializes in collecting human children's screams to turn into clean dependable energy 
But the days are getting tougher with kids getting harder to scare and a scare shortage might be on the rise 
Sully is the top scarer competing with rival Randall 
Mike has a girlfriend Celia and the company is run by Mr. Waternoose 
Things change big time when a little human girl named Boo stumbles into the monster world thereby putting Sully and Mike in a bit of a pickle 
Moreover all monsters are lead to believe that a single touch from a human child is toxic 
But Boo bonds with Mike and Sully while at the same time they try to keep her avoid getting caught in a darker conspiracy 
PIXAR does it again with top-notch computer graphics, wonderful voicework, a really creative setup, nice monster designs being very distinguished, funny moments, and plenty of emotional ones too 
Sully and Mike are the best kind of duo buddies, Boo is so adorable tugging at the heartstrings, and the writers have the monsters fear something not from their world they don't quite understand 
A funny twist of us being scared of monsters but having them be scared of us in return 
I remember seeing it in the Adirondacks with my sisters and we were enamored 
The movie was another hit making over $800 million 
A perfect mix of pathos, humor, adventure, and heartbreak 
I like Jennifer Tilly as Celia and Steve Buscemi as Randall 
Im really glad too they put the movie as a level in Kingdom Hearts 3 
20 years later and the movie still leaves a big impact on our culture as well as animation fans even spawning a prequel, video games, and a recent Disney + tv series 
'Monsters Inc' is one of the earliest examples of children's entertainment that works telling a human story with non-human characters at the helm"
501,monsters_inc,audience,5.0,n,"Another certified Disney Pixar classic. It doesn't matter if this is a Halloween movie or not, all it matters is it's a great movie. 5/5"
502,monsters_inc,audience,4.0,n,A fun time. One of Pixar's hits.
503,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,"The Velvet Underground may not offer the same joy as listening to its eponymous band, but does a great job of reminding the audience why that band remains hugely influential and unique so many years later."
504,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,"If you already love the Velvet Underground, this is two hours of visual and aural bliss. If you don't, same."
505,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Claims for the eternal qualities of any music are dubious at best, but what Haynes exhibits through his own complex, textured documentary is that the Velvet Underground's music remains fertile ground for inspiration."
506,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Captures both why Warhol was so taken by the band, and the reason the Velvet Underground were not made for factory settings."
507,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,"If you're a fan, it will send you back to the original albums with new zeal. If the group is only something you know from banana t-shirts... it will likely make you a convert."
508,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,Haynes jettisons the traditional role of talking heads; he dispatches incidental music; he regards emotional arcs and sentimentality the way he might a toothache. He made a film that feels of a kind with the subject.
509,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,"What makes a rock band worth attending to a half century after its breakup isn't its personalities or backstory or context, interesting as those can be, and here they're all highly interesting. It's the music."
510,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,An artfully rendered and understandably chaotic account of the New York art scene of the 1960s.
511,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,The scene was well documented and the seemingly unlimited access Haynes and editors Alfonso Gonçalves and Adam Kurnitz had to the Warhol Foundation archives help paint a picture of an amphetamine-fuelled era.
512,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Half a very good music documentary, and half an extraordinary, exultant experience."
513,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,"If you're a fan of the late Lou Reed, Todd Haynes' skillfully made and informative documentary ""The Velvet Underground"" is right up your alley."
514,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,"It's artistic, accomplished, but your response to it might depend upon your age and where you were in those years."
515,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,"From the gorgeous gloom of V.U.'s debut with Andy Warhol and Nico to the dissonant pop-art audaciousness of their follow-up White Light/White Heat, the story is one of inspiration and evolution"
516,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,"It's not a great documentary, yet fairly informative and entertaining."
517,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,An audiovisual blast that delves into the creative combat that birthed America's first great avant-garde rock 'n' roll band.
518,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,Todd Haynes's excellent new documentary on legendary rock band the Velvet Underground reminds us of just how daring both music and film once was not that long ago.
519,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,"It's beautifully flawed, far too long, and deeply rewarding."
520,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,"No fan of Haynes or the VU should skip this - and if you're not a fan of at least one of the two, what gives?"
521,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,"The most appropriate documentary possible for the influential avant-garde rock band: An eclectic, challenging and artful movie that a lot of people may not get."
522,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Haynes' dazzling visuals are grounded by interviews with the two living band members - most extensively John Cale, the Welshman and classically trained violist who formed a potent partnership with the Long Island-born Reed."
523,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,5.0,n,I love box office man
524,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,5.0,n,The definitive doc that in years to come will be inseparable from the bands legacy. Captures the essence and spirit of the band.
525,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,5.0,n,"Excellent documentary for Velvet Underground fans.   It discusses the band members fairly equally with a focus on what their motivations were, how they worked together, inspirations and their backgrounds.   Includes a good deal about Nico as well.  Great clips of Warhol and some of his art films, too. It will re-spark interest in their music if you hadn’t heard them in awhile. It almost  “takes you there” to the time period and captures it’s energy."
526,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,4.5,n,A pretty good documentary about one of my favorite bands and a favorite artist.
527,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,4.0,n,"Better than expected - it has a narrative but a little overlong, especially at the beginning. Lots about Lou as you might expect but little from him. He was difficult to interview l guess. Glad Mo Tucker got a shout out for After Hours. That deserved to be a big record, best flat singing ever (eat your heart out Morrissey). John Cale looks miles better now than in the day when he would walked it into Slytherin. Not sure how a non fan would like this. Nor am l really sure what the legacy is. Definitely Bowie. Moontans, skinny tight everything black and shades?"
528,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,3.5,n,"Highly recommended for anyone interested in the Velvets or the 1960s avant garde art/music scene, but might be a bit boring for others. Interesting/artsy use of video clips. Lots of old video/audio clips that have probably never been seen/heard by most viewers."
529,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,2.5,p,"The director of this documentary is obviously a huge fan of the late 60s avant garde movement in New York. While it was interesting to see what brought the band together, a little more time could have been spent on their later work. Most of the movie seemed more centred on Andy Warhol and his ilk, instead of the genius that Lou Reed and company brought to the table. Most of the focus is on the first two albums, then it seems like "" Oh then they made a couple of more successful albums and Lou Reed walked away. The end."""
530,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,5.0,n,"It gives a new whole perspective about the importance of The Velvet Underground. In addition to incredible unpublished footage, the film contextualizes the band's emergence within an effervescent avant-garde scene of the 50s and 60s in music (John Cale disciple of John Cage and La Monte Young), literature (Lou Reed linked to Allen Ginsberg and Delmore Schwartz ), visual arts (Warhol, etc.) and cinema (Jonas Mekas)."
531,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,3.5,n,"The Velvet Underground is a pretty unique documentary. I didn’t know anything about the band going into this. The main reason I watched this is because I’m a big fan of Todd Haynes as a director. I was very curious to see what he’d bring to the documentary genre. I learned that the titular band was very experimental, and Haynes’ approach to the material fits that description. I loved the use of split screen, and the editing of the images worked very well. The film was at its best when it wasn’t afraid to diverge from what you typically see in a music documentary. Unfortunately, there were times where the film leaned into those cliches, with the typical talking heads structure and moving from album to album. I feel like this could’ve been amazing if it stuck to the weird montage style the entire time. Still, it’s a pretty interesting watch. Overall, I liked this. It packs a lot of information in 2 hours, and it’s definitely not a fast paced watch. But Haynes’ direction and the band themselves make it a worthwhile watch. If you love the band you’re probably watching regardless of what I say. But if you’re on the fence I say give it a watch if you like things that are more on the experimental side."
532,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,"It's almost like watching therapy in real time, and it's one of the best films I've seen this year. [Full review in Spanish]"
533,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,A movie that'll make your hugs squeeze a little tighter and words carry more significance once it concludes.
534,mass_2021,critics,rotten,n,"Kudos to Ann Dowd, Martha Plimpton, Reed Birney and Jason Isaacs, but this is not the stuff that movie careers - or memorable movies - are made of."

552,mass_2021,audience,4.5,n,"Rating: A

""Mass is undoubtedly one of the most emotionally challenging viewings I've ever had to face. Fran Kranz's feature directorial debut tells an unbelievably heavy story through four actors who dive deep into their characters, all delivering career-best performances. Everyone is an incredible standout: Jason Isaacs, Ann Dowd, Martha Plimpton, and Reed Birney deserve a massive campaign to receive every acting award there is. The cast drains every single ounce of emotion within the viewers, transforming a tiny little room with impactful mise-en-scène that tells its own story into an extremely tense, heart-wrenching, almost unbreathable environment. Dozens of meaningful matters and challenging feelings are addressed in the span of little less than two hours, creating a truly devastating film that left me sobbing. It's utterly impossible for someone not to be affected by this movie, even if it's in a negative way. It's one of those films that I'll recommend to everyone and support throughout its eventual release, but I can't deny this might have been my one and only watch of such a brutally demanding, authentic story."""
553,mass_2021,audience,4.5,n,"Somewhere between In The Bedroom and We Need To Talk About Kevin, this is the best chamber piece written for the big screen in a long time. Fran Kranz delivers one of the very best screenplays of the year and the quartet of performances is nothing short of extraordinary. Heartbreaking, magnetic, unforgettable."
554,mass_2021,audience,5.0,n,"On the eve of yet another school shooting, Mass is the perfect movie to dispense with the theatrics of extremist politics, and really dive in to the after effects of trauma of what these moments are like for the people who are left.. Raw, unflinching, and emotional.  Mass will reach the part of you that knows this has gone on for far too long."
555,mass_2021,audience,4.5,n,"Fran Kranz, previously known mainly as an actor, tells an original story in his directorial debut Mass, which could seem like an adapted play to many. Six years after a devastating tragedy, the parents of two victims gather in the room of a church to come to terms with the events of that time together. This results in a real emotional chaos between four protagonists, peppered with grief, pain, anger and pure fear.

I have often heard that Mass is a quiet film. Yes, it's not a sci-fi blockbuster with countless scenarios, dispenses entirely with any effects and has only four central characters. In that respect, it is definitely a quiet film. But if you define calm by emotional connection, then Mass is probably the spectacle of the year. For what is rehashed and thematised here rips your heart out. Rarely have I shed so many tears at a film. Rarely have all the protagonists grown so close to my heart despite their different behaviours. Never have dialogues and monologues been so close to my heart. This is largely due to Franz's borderline brilliant screenplay. But in this film it is the actors who make the difference. I have rarely come across such a top-class performance from an ensemble. All four get moments to shine and do so with incredible bravura. I'll start with Jason Isaacs, probably the most recognisable name among the four. His character Jay still can't believe the incident and death of his son. He tries to understand the psyche of the perpetrator, who turns out to be the son of the other parents. Although he tries not to ask too much of them at first, he becomes more and more impatient and angry as time goes on. This leads to a scene where Jay snaps and takes the conversation in a completely different direction. From this point on he is an emotional wreck. You buy both emotional states from Isaacs through his facial expressions alone. Best Supporting Actor 2022: Jason Isaacs, Mass. Let's move on to the two mothers, Gale (Martha Plimpton) and Linda (Ann Dowd). The former is unexpectedly restrained until the last act, before letting her baggage run free at the end. And in a way that is simply unfathomable. Plimpton's chemistry with Isaacs is insanely authentic and if you said they'd been through this thing in real life, I'd believe it. Ann Dowd is much more eloquent in her role and always tries to be the emotional constant through subtlety. Until a final monologue that must win Dowd the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Even though she and Plimpton give each other nothing here. If only there were Reed Birney as the no-nonsense and proud businessman Richard. He talks a lot but never really gets too specific. He is emotionally stiff. Although he visibly wants to open up more, he can't. This is frustrating to watch, but also couldn't be better portrayed. Birney also deserves all the praise in the world for his less emotional but efficient performance.

So yes, Mass is an acting masterpiece. One that I have rarely seen in this form and one that will stay with me for a very long time. It tells a tragic story in such a realistic manner that you almost believe you are really standing in the room listening to the four people on the spot. Dialogue has rarely been so tangible and distant for someone who, thank God, has never had to go through something like this. But at the same time, it's a film I probably won't be able to watch again because of the sheer harshness of its subject matter. Moreover, certain visual cuts are unnecessary. But no one cares about that."

557,mass_2021,audience,5.0,n,Powerful performances by everyone! Such an important movie.

586,judas_and_the_black_messiah,audience,2.5,p,"Before I get into this review, I have to say the soundtrack(or at least this one tune that's part of the soundtrack) really annoyed me. It plays in the beginning before Bill goes into the bar and once again near the end when he's getting the drugs to off Fred. To me it sounded like a very loud and weirdly annoying train and each time I just had to hit the mute button. Anyways, for the movie itself.. it was alright, but a bit too long for my taste. Depressing a bit, cops killing blacks in the late 60's in Chicago and one of the guys in the Black Panther party is an undercover guy working for the FBI because of a stolen car. Sucks that this is the way of the totally not racist America(:sarcasm alert:) but that's the reality we live in, even today."

The film is a technical marvel, with immaculate, time period accurate production design and visuals, supported by an immersive soundtrack. It is also superbly acted and very well shot.

Non ci sono facili colpi di scena, ne personaggi ""manichino"" volti ad abbellire il cast.
Si punta tutto sulla grandissima qualità della sceneggiatura e sull'ottima credibilità del cast; in special modo su uno degli astri nascenti del cinema quale Daniel Kaluuya, in grado di rappresentare con grandissima intensità un personaggio che per tutto il film non usa mai il suo corpo o le sue espressioni in maniera esagerata; ma che colpisce solamente con lo sguardo e con le parole.
Il finale è scioccante tanto da lasciare interdetti nella maniera più assoluta; le didascalie finali offrono il giusto resoconto per permettere di essere a conoscenza anche dei fatti tralasciati per ragioni cinematografiche."

Her friends did a great job supporting her until the end and you also one friend pull away, as does happen sometimes in the face of inevitable tragedy. I agree they should have depi ted hair loss, as most people with cancer do experience it while only a lucky few don't, but other than that, this was a good movie.

We are informed that Marley is funny and likable, but none of her words or actions demonstrate this. I'm not sure why her friend lets her be alone with her kid so much, given she's the sort of person to ride a bike drunk in the middle of the street.

Our beloved Kate Hudson comes back to treat us with another witty,  heart-wrenching romance (as we have all come to expect from her). Kate and the fellow cast for this movie give us a cancer story like no other. As you watch Hudson's character (Marley) develop, you fall in love instantly. 

This movie has become one of my most cherished finds of all time. I have to say, I was very dismayed to see such a bad reception. The movie does drift away from the realities of cancer. AND THAT IS OK! I don't know anyone who would want to endure an entire movie of sadness and heartache without a little humor and zest?! I sure don't. Long story short, give the film a chance.

There's lots else that doesn't make sense about this movie.  Where the random barrels of fire around the underground basketball court came from remains a mystery to me, for example.

There was a period of time that this was the lowest rated film on all of IMDB.  While I don't think it is fair to call it the worst film ever made, it is terrible (though there is something oddly entertaining about how truly bad it really is).  It certainly has many ""so bad it's good"" moments."

I soon realize that this movie is complete trash that 8 year old me couldn't see. I want get through with the positives first. Ok I admit I was entertained but not in the way that the movie wanted me to be entertained. To make that statement clear, I was having a great time laughing throughout the movie. Another positive thing is that I feel for the two main characters because of their brief backstory and their complexity of characteristics/ personalities. And the last positive thing is that the street ball sequences are well choreographed and pretty cool. Ok now we are getting into the real juice here. The negatives are the poor directing overall. The very low budget sound editing is atrocious. The acting is pretty bad. Besides the main characters everyone else is either one dimensional or paper cut outs or even both. Sloppy editing especially when pointless montages occurs during the halfway mark. The pacing is undetected. The music doesn't fit into scenes correctly. Shaky cam and poor lighting everywhere!!! Throw away plot that is so generic is should become a plot for a TV soap opera. Actually, this is a soap opera but made into a movie. The movie is extremely predictable. Horrible dialogue that makes me die of laughter every time I think of it. Drama that you can care less about. All these factors drive this film down even more. I've seen potential but was just wasted by the wrong guys for the job. I don't hate the movie I just thought it was bad to the point that you can't take it seriously. Truthfully I won't watch this film ever again in my life. That being said I would recommend you watching this at least once for free. So you can get a huge kick out of this. Trust me this a great comedy disguised as a horrible sports drama. I want to give this film a F but I can't do it when I think of the entertaining aspect of it in the wrong way. Basketball scenes were pretty good too bad they only had only 2 scenes. Overall, I will give the movie 'Crossover' a D- grading."

652,jaws_the_revenge,critics,rotten,n,"Jaws: The Revenge (1987) has that amazing Percy Rodrigues-narrated trailer (""This time ... it's personal"") and a sadly excised voodoo subplot, but it's also an attempt to give Lorraine Gary something to do after 12 years and too many folk lost."
653,jaws_the_revenge,critics,rotten,n,...an entirely misbegotten capper to a seriously erratic series.
654,jaws_the_revenge,critics,rotten,n,"At least, the onslaughts are a bit bloodier than before, and this 1987 production doesn't resort to unsophisticated computer graphics."
655,jaws_the_revenge,critics,rotten,n,"After all the dire reports of production delays, inclement weather and special-effects foul-ups, it should come as no great surprise that the problem-plagued ""Jaws: The Revenge"" looks like something haphazardly pieced together in a hurry."

657,jaws_the_revenge,critics,rotten,n,"The film is wholly unnecessary and adds nothing to the series, instead pulling the shark into weirdly supernatural, slasher-movie territory."
658,jaws_the_revenge,critics,rotten,n,"'Jaws: The Revenge' bears the marks of its rushed production, from the seemingly first-draft screenplay to its sloppy execution to the slender running time (under 90 minutes without credits) to the generally cheap look and feel."

662,jaws_the_revenge,critics,rotten,n,"Everything in Jaws the Revenge is utterly expectable, which isn't a bright idea for a film relying on suspense and tension."
663,jaws_the_revenge,critics,rotten,n,Let`s put it this way: When you see and hear the nasal Lorraine Gary on screen you want the shark to eat her.

686,shadow_conspiracy,critics,rotten,n,"Sadly, Sheen doesn't even look profound. Like a zombie who's spent too much time in the gym, he blunders heavily from one stunt to the next, his pursed lips conveying nothing more than pique."

693,shadow_conspiracy,critics,rotten,n,The film is so contemptuous of its audience it doesn't even bother to present a surface resemblance to reality.
694,shadow_conspiracy,critics,rotten,n,The whole thing is so vague and preposterous and paranoid that it almost goes without saying that Donald Sutherland plays a key role.
695,shadow_conspiracy,critics,rotten,n,
696,shadow_conspiracy,critics,rotten,n,"Sheen is a handsome and resourceful actor, but not enough so to win in this conspiracy of shadows over substance."

703,shadow_conspiracy,audience,0.5,p,"There was an audience review mentioning it being bad because Cosmatos not only directed this, but also directed Rambo III.  Absolutely false.  He did not direct Rambo III (he directed II), and he is not to blame for this disaster.  Charlie Sheen is the one responsible for this mess by over stepping his bounds and rewriting large parts of the script.  Cosmatos didn't even finish the filming of this movie, going to the hospital of exhaustion.  It is a shame that his legacy is tarnished by Sheen.  Look at Cosmatos' other work and judge for yourself."

707,shadow_conspiracy,audience,1.5,p,"Terrible plot, and Sheen is unconvincing and very slow on the uptake for a wunderkind.  Silly and funny in all the wrong places."
708,shadow_conspiracy,audience,3.0,n,"Certainly has cheesy, poorly-funded production characteristics, but is actually quite a good little thriller. Little lower-budget Terminator-envy shoot 'em up action sequences'll never hurt anybody...and it's a lot more enjoyable than many by-the-numbers ""good"" movies. Recommended, courtesy of yours truly."
709,shadow_conspiracy,audience,0.5,p,"This is an absolute disaster of a movie. Poor acting and a failure to create an atmosphere that anyone is in any danger (even those who are being directly targeted) sinks this movie, and then you still are left with another hour to watch."

733,jack_and_jill_2011,audience,4.0,n,Its quite nonsensical and silly but the thing that gives this film thumbs up from me is it is funny. Sure the story is kind of stupid but it is really humorous and I laughed so many times.

745,getting_even_with_dad,critics,rotten,n,The new summer movies don't get much more formulaic than this bald attempt to capture the audience that can't wait to see the next three or four installments of Home Alone.
746,getting_even_with_dad,critics,rotten,n,The feeble attempts at verbal and physical slapstick are so lacking in humour that they're embarrassing for both the players and audience.
747,getting_even_with_dad,critics,rotten,n,"Howard Deutch is a proficient enough second division director, but here he allows sentimentality to run riot, and the awkwardly ageing Culkin (approaching adolescence) no longer possesses the mischievous charm of old."

750,getting_even_with_dad,critics,rotten,n,This seems to be the work not of screenwriters but of Hollywood marketing executives who believe movies are popular because they tell audiences what they want to hear.

794,material_girls,audience,2.0,p,Even the gr8 director Martha Coolidge (Valley Girl) can't save this hot mess
795,material_girls,audience,0.5,p,"When I tell people that I watch any type of film, I really do mean it. Though I am a guy, I'm certainly not above watching chick flicks. However, that being said, chick flicks have also given me some of the worst film-watching experiences I've ever had that still scar me years after watching them. Sometimes I even shudder as I recall the experiences of watching them.

I know there are female viewers that try to say that these films are escapist entertainment, much like what us guys watch when it comes to action films or gross out comedies, but even the stupidest of those films still have some level of respect for their viewers, even if it is rather minimal at times. With a film like Material Girls, it has no respect for its viewers. It views its audience as a bunch of prissy, whiny, stupid, glamor-obsessed girls with roughly the same brain cell count as a cardboard box, while throwing in a half-assed moral message that means nothing in the end.

It's a film that thinks if it sticks popular (At the time, of course) preteen icons for girls into a film, fashion, annoying pop music, romantic cliches so lazy you'll want to vomit, pop culture references, and a gamut of other things that plague chick flicks, that it can just get away with being a piece of shit because of its ""target audience"" which is quite shameful. Oh no, Material Girls, I'm not letting you get away.

Sisters Tanzie and Ava (Real-life sisters, Hilary and Haylie Duff) are two rich girls who spend all their time partying and shopping, as they inherited their late father's cosmetics company, even though they do nothing to help run it. They are simply riding on the cash flow from the company.

But, Tanzie still dearly misses her father, even watching an old TiVo recording of him promoting his cosmetics every now and then and refusing to erase it, despite pressures from her sister to do so.

But one day, their lives are turned upside down when a tabloid program claims that the company's cosmetic products cause terrible skin conditions, threatening to destroy the company, causing their assets to be frozen, having an angry mob after them, and losing all of their so-called ""friends"" in the process.

While at home in their mansion, with an angry mob outside their gates, a fire is accidentally started, burning down their mansion and forcing them to stay with their maid, since their credit cards are no longer active and they can't stay anywhere else. They are now homeless, broke, jobless, and completely clueless as they have no idea how the outside works from their insular rich bubble of a world.

But, there is a ray of hope for the girls when a rival cosmetics company offers to buy their company for several million dollars. But, Tanzie refuses the deal, and decides to start an investigation into what is really going on at their company since she believes that they were framed, resulting in a series of supposed-to-be-funny shenanigans along the way as they investigate.

I do enjoy a good comedy about high society or takedowns of rich people (Including celebrities), but Material Girls is horribly dissatisfying in its storytelling. Even by the most minimum standards of chick flicks, this storyline is vacant and hollow, doing only the bare minimum to have a story and one-note characters so that it can be considered a film. There was absolutely no effort or care put into the storyline. This is easily one of the most lazily-written films I've ever seen. The average viewer, even if they possess no writing abilities of any sort, could write a script that would look Oscar-worthy in comparison to this script.

The two lead characters are nothing but two spoiled, bratty bitches, while the Tanzie character only has the minute elements of being a semi good girl sort of character who is also slightly smarter than her very dim-witted sister, Ava. I never rooted for them and I never cared, even when their characters seemed to become smarter and learned how to be semi-normal people.

Even with cast members like Anjelica Huston and Brent Spiner (Who also appeared in another horrible comedy, The Master Of Disguise. Were things really so bad after they stopped making Star Trek films for awhile?), the script does absolutely nothing with them, outside of simple caricatures, being possible lame villains, or red herrings in the story's abominable insertion of mystery elements that makes even the most generic of mystery films look masterful by comparison.

It also has absolutely nothing insightful to say about rich people, high society, regular life, clearing one's name from a false accusation, or anything all together. It's all about following two air-headed tarts who aren't even funny or interesting air-headed tarts (I should have Romy And Michele's High School Reunion again instead. Now that was a funny film about air-headed tarts).

The acting is horrible across the board. As much as I disliked A Cinderella Story, in which Hilary Duff was the lead star, I felt that she gave a good performance in that film and showed signs of being far more capable than what that film would lead the viewer to believe. Unfortunately, that aura is definitely not present in this film. Here, Hilary Duff is just annoying, though at least she's more tolerable than her sister. I'm not sure what sort of acting abilities Haylie Duff might possess, but she was beyond bad in this film. Together, they're both just annoying tarts that began to grate on my nerves within less than two minutes of watching this abomination.

Anjelica Huston is shamefully wasted and her presence is practically nonexistent, though she is probably the best actress of the bunch by doing another bitchy sort of performance, which was mildly entertaining at times. No other cast members are worth noting, other than expressing sadness over seeing the decline of Brent Spiner's career.

Entertainment? What entertainment? This film is so hollow and vacant, that even viewers with the most minimum standards for chick flicks will be hard-pressed to find anything of value in this film. It has only the most shallow elements of storytelling, characters so one-dimensional they are one step away from just being cardboard cutouts, horrible and unfunny jokes, and horrible acting. There is nothing to derive from this film other than brief moments of Anjelica Huston's performance which can be momentarily entertaining to watch.

Humor? Are you fucking kidding me? For comedies I usually try to have an extra paragraph to dedicate to humor, but there is not one positive thing that I can say about the humor. There are no funny parts.

Material Girls is a horrible film that has only a single redeeming quality thanks only to Anjelica Huston's performance. Other than her, there is nothing of value to find, even if you have even the most shallow of standards for this type of film. Avoid it at all costs if you want to keep your sanity intact."

(Mauro Lanari)"
890,playing_for_keeps_2012,audience,0.5,p,"Playing for Keeps is a really hard movie to like. I tried to find one positive thing to say about the film, and I came up empty. I can imagine even rom-com fans will have a hard time liking this film, as I'm sure they have seen many better ones.

The acting is serviceable, which is the highest praise I can give to this film. Playing for Keeps stars Gerard Butler, Jessica Biel, Dennis Quaid, Judy Greer, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Uma Thurman. Not a bad cast. You're not going to think any of them are bad actors/actresses (even the child actor was pretty good overall), but they're not really doing their best, and the chemistry between Biel and Butler isn't that great.

The problem with this movie is that it's very melodramatic. Playing for Keeps was directed by Gabriele Muccino, director of The Pursuit of Happyness and Seven Pounds, both decent movies that starred Will Smith. Though they were both very melodramatic, at least the movie earned some of the melodrama. Playing for Keeps does not because the lead character isn't relatable. He's a former football player (as a British person, the word soccer doesn't exist) who's down on his luck, but seemingly gets everything handed to him when he becomes a children's football coach, such as a job as a sports anchor and a Ferrari just because he's friends with Dennis Quaid. Kids love him, women want to have sex with him, men want to be him, and it's one of the most self-aggrandizing pieces of shit I've ever seen (with Butler also serving as a producer).

Dennis Quaid was over-the-top and annoying. He plays a supporting role as a rich, unfaithful businessman who bribes George (Gerard Butler) with what looks like a thousand dollars (my estimate might be wrong) so that his son can be goalkeeper and his daughter can sing the national anthem. Why is that so important to him? And his admiration for George just felt awkward.

The women in the movie are idiots, with Uma Thurman being the biggest idiot of them all, and her shrillness made her character really irritating. Not that George is any smarter because he lets his child drive a Ferrari on the road at what looks like 60mph. The women are idiots for comedy purposes, but I only laughed once. The tone was also inconsistent. It's a bland and slightly crude rom-com in one scene and a mawkishly sentimental family drama in another.

Playing for Keeps is a very basic rom-com where Gerard Butler tries to be more responsible and rekindle his relationship with his son and ex-wife. Of course, his ex-wife takes him back in the end because the movie didn't even try to give her fiance a personality. He does nothing other than open the door and greet Gerard Butler. There isn't even a subplot where he's suspicious that Jessica Biel might be cheating on him.

Playing for Keeps is a really bad film, which plays right into Gerard Butler's wheelhouse (I have yet to see a good Gerard Butler movie), but it's sad to see Gabriele Muccino sink this low. Playing for Keeps is a terrible rom-com that's on par with Gigli, and we all know what happened to Martin Brest after that film. Muccino's career is probably dead now because of this film, as his latest film (Fathers & Daughters) was a critical and commercial failure. Thankfully, I saw this film on YouTube as no one cares enough about the film to take it down and it helped me fall asleep. So the next time I need help falling asleep (because I do get insomnia), I'll just watch this film again on YouTube."
891,playing_for_keeps_2012,audience,2.0,p,"Playing for keeps is a pretty stereotypical romantic comedy. The movie comes across as entirely too predictable, but with an extremely diverse gamut of characters (this is not a good thing). I didn't understand about half of the characters in this film, as a matter of fact, I would argue that if you got rid of them it might actually push this movie to be slightly better. Gerard Butler and Jessica Biel are pleasantly average in their performances and the storyline is mediocre-ly interesting. 

Overall the movie was enjoyable, but definitely not something I'm going to be reaching for to rewatch anytime soon."

A process server, Joe Tyler (played by Matthew Perry) is given the task of serving divorce papers on Sara Moore (Elizabeth Hurley), the wife of of a wealthy Texas businessman.  To do so he needs to contend with her attempts at evasion and the attempts of a colleague to undermine him.

You would think that the comedy of Matthew Perry and the allure of Liz Hurley would make for a decent movie.  They do the best they can, but are massively undermined by the script writers.  The movie is not funny.  The attempts at jokes are incredibly bad - even Perry with his great physical humour, timing and delivery can't make them work.  You can't polish a turd...

On the plus side (and it's the only plus), Liz Hurley does light up the screen and is a good distraction from the woefulness of the remainder of the movie.

Interesting to note that the supporting cast includes Amy Adams in one of her earliest movies.

930,because_i_said_so,critics,rotten,n,"This is a by-the-book chick flick we're talking about, but the writers and director apparently didn't want to push the envelope when it came to the supporting characters -- or the main characters."

961,getaway,critics,rotten,n,"For all of its vices, I can't help but think that we've brought Getaway on ourselves. It's not the car chase film we need right now, but it's probably the car chase movie we deserve. And if the finale is any indication, a sequel could be ready to go."

He is given a car and given marching orders thru the streets of Bulgaria in the meantime he comes across computer wiz Selena Gomez.  Together they try to out smart the villain who turns out to be Jon Voight and to get back his wife before it's too late.  Unless you like the multiple police car chases and car crashes this is your type of movie.  Overall it was an okay movie to watch nothing great and nothing you will ever remember watching. You could skip this one.

980,getaway,audience,2.0,p,"Story/Screenplay: (1.5/5)  Ridiculous.

Duration/Tempo: (2.5/5)  At 1 hour and 30 minutes, this is a short movie, which is good because it still felt a little long.  Good pacing, but the story line was poor.

Cast & Crew: (3.5/5)  Ethan Hawke and Selena Gomez did well with a bad story.  Enjoyed them both.

Summary: Overall, 2 out of 5 stars.  Our protagonist gets to drive a Shelby GT500 very fast for most of the movie.  This should be cool, but he's forced into reckless situations that put hundreds of other peoples' lives at stake.  Not cool.  This film had potential but failed to realize it."

Even in a pile of dung there is some good and I do think the two female leads Louise and and Renee had good on-screen chemistry the script was just garbage."
1033,gold_diggers,audience,3.0,n,National Lampoon's have done much better comedies and this film's plot is ridiculous but I have to admit that I did laugh at some elements here. Will Friedle does well as a leading man in this movie and clearly tries to step out of his Eric Matthews character from Boy Meets World. It does go way over the top and tries to be as offensive as American Pie with Chris Owen who played Sherman in American Pie cast in Gold Diggers.

1042,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,Nina feels like a movie made by people who fundamentally misunderstood Nina Simone. It conclusively proves that representation behind the camera is as important as representation on screen.
1043,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,"This film had a great opportunity to take a once-in-a-lifetime story about a troubled, legendary singer, and add insight. Nina, in the most frustrating way, bungles that mission."
1044,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,"If this is a greatest hits album, Nina picks the least-accessible songs and then puts them all in the wrong order."
1045,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,"An insult to the legacy of the High Priestess of Soul, those looking for a richer exploration of the woman, artist, activist and legend, are best served elsewhere."
1046,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,"Never seems authentic or real, just a bizarrely staged re-creation."
1047,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,"While Saldana gives her very best in trying to embody the essence of Miss Simone with equal support from co-star David Oyelowo, both are confined to a weak script and for Saldana, probably the worst makeup job she's had on the big screen."
1048,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,"All in all, Nina is watchable in and of itself, but I can't recommend your paying full price for it, especially if you're a Nina Simone devotee."
1049,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,"A 90-minute-long character assassination, transforming a music legend into a Hanna-Barbera cartoon."
1050,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,"Respectfully factual in its over-all contours but sensational and sentimental nonetheless, the movie reduces Simone's life to clichés about hope; it replaces the creative drive with the commercial one, the artist with the celebrity."
1051,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,"Saldana does a fine job of delivering the lyrics -- a daunting task for any actress required to step into those vocals, but fans of Simone will be aching for the real deal."
1052,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,"A Nina Simone novice seeing this picture would have no idea who this complex, magnificent artist was, or why she mattered."
1053,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,"Zoe Saldana's woeful casting is just one of a myriad of reasons to despise Nina, as its plot and characterization fail to glean any insight into the iconic musician and Civil Rights activist."
1054,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,"Why Mort, who wrote and directed the film, has chosen to focus on Simone's troubled 1990s period in France is anyone's guess."
1055,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,Nina teaches us an important lesson about waiting for a film to come out before criticizing it. For it is only then that we can know how truly heinous it is.
1056,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,The word on this Nina Simone biopic has been so toxic for so long - it was filmed in 2012 but only released now - I was really hoping to find something good in it. No luck.

1063,nina_2016,audience,1.5,p,As far as autobiographies girl Nina is definitely at the bottom of the barrel. After watching this film I learned very little about Nina and a bunch of the film is her just singing music. The movie is miss cast with what seems forced performances. The script was also pretty bad. The movie had good intentions but it’s also pretty boring.
1064,nina_2016,audience,0.5,p,"awful.  poorly casted, poorly written."
1065,nina_2016,audience,0.5,p,"Terrible casting; it tanked the entire movie. Nina's story needs to be told, but not like this."
1066,nina_2016,audience,3.0,n,"The best bit of this film is Zoe Saldana's performance as Nina Simone, I thought she was spot on playing the singer at her most self destructive. What lets the film down a little is the way it is edited.  It flits through various times in her life often without purpose.  The focus is on Nina's later years and her relationship with her assistant who tried his best to look after the singer and save her career.  It's a film with a strong decent lead and some very good music, it's just a shame that the rest of the film can't lift this up to the level of better musical biopics such as Walk the Line, Ray, Love & Mercy, Backbeat etc"
1067,nina_2016,audience,0.5,p,"i didnt even know the movie was still made, this is hilarious."
1068,nina_2016,audience,3.5,n,"Deserved a far better response.  Whatever wingspan this thing lacks behind the camera, is well made-up-for by Saldana's own."
1069,nina_2016,audience,3.0,n,"Nina is a by-the-numbers musical biopic riddled with every conceivable cliché about ""the tortured artist."" Nina never decides what it wants to say or where it wants to take us. Saldana (Avatar, Guardians of the Galaxy) is an accomplished and bankable actress, but she doesn't look much like Simone. That has led to several complaints, including from the Simone estate. A certain integrity and seriousness of intent gleams through, but Nina is just too big a subject, and talent, to be compressed into such a small package. Ignore all the politically-correct, blackface haters. Singing aside, Zoe Saldana delivers a decent enough Nina Simone impersonation here to make you wonder what all the brouhaha was ever about. Aside from some clunky expository dialogue and a few concluding title cards, the film barely goes into how Nina ended up so broken. It does try to give her a half-hearted redemption arc, but it fails to take off without convincing the audience why Nina needs or deserves redeeming. Zoe Saldana stirred up controversy by taking the title role, because she darkened her skin with makeup to play the part. That said, she acts with the right fire and sings beautifully and evocatively. During a long, uncut performance of ""Wild Is the Wind,"" one of Simone's signature songs, we suddenly see why jazz fans swooned at her feet.

VERDICT: ""In The Zone"" - [Mixed Reaction] These kinds of movies are usually movies that had some good things, but some bad things kept it from being amazing. This rating says buy an ex-rental or a cheap price of the DVD to own. If you consider cinema, ask for people's opinion on the film. (Films that are rated 2.5 or 3 stars)"
1070,nina_2016,audience,4.0,n,"uste eden dobar muzicki film za golemata legendarna Nina Simone...film koj vredi da se pogledne, posebno tie sto ja cenat i slusaat...edinstvenoto sto ne stima vo filmov e sto Zoe Saldana e premnogu zgodna i ubava za da ja igra Nina :)"
1071,nina_2016,audience,1.5,p,"Despite Zoe Saldana's fairly decent performance, this film is a disappointing biographical drama to the great Nina Simone. The script is bland, the sequences boring, and the musical moments don't represent her powerful voice."

1073,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,This gravely serious drama is as insular as a tomb with Muzak.
1074,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"Hamm's and Lucas' performances are fine, but first-time director Anders Anderson is heavy-handed and overwrought, portraying emotional turmoil with clichs."
1075,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"A leaden murder mystery with a clunky structure that swings back and forth between 1958 and 2008, Stolen wastes the talents of a reasonably good cast."
1076,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"One poorly told story would be bad enough but with ""Stolen"" we have two."
1077,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"Not a masterpiece, perhaps, but technically polished, with inspired performances and enough suspense that by the time Mr. Hamm found the redemption that freed him from his own demons, I was so wired I needed a Valium."
1078,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"No one is able to make much of the disposable script, but Hamm is so limited by the period trappings that it seems as if he simply wandered onto the wrong set."
1079,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"Plays like a middling episode of Law & Order: SVU, drawn out an extra half-hour and embellished with pretentious literary and cinematic flourishes."

1081,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"Every bit the unpleasant slog one might expect, glum and murkily shot, wallowing in pedantic histrionics and badly lacking the breathing room it desperately needs."
1082,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"The low-boil mystery-thriller Stolen was once known as The Boy In The Box and then Stolen Lives, but now has a title as nondescript as its contents."
1083,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"Hamm himself is too smart a performer for movies like these, but let's write it off as a canny career move to take a vacation from Don Draper and his glumness."
1084,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,[A] graceless piece of tragedy porn...
1085,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,Anders Anderson's thriller struggles to intertwine the two mysteries and ends up doing justice to neither.
1086,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"Not pretentious in its implications, 'Stolen' nevertheless depends excessively on coincidence, on unlikely connections and not clearly differentiated characters."
1087,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,Stolen reveals a filmmaking hand in need of a considerable amount of seasoning.
1088,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"In the lead-up to the inevitable connection, Anderson builds suspense around innumerable close-ups of telephone touchpads, liquids being spilled, [and] Lucas straining to be a credible hayseed."
1089,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,A technically polished thriller marred by textbook filmmaking that grows increasingly dull as the plot wears on.
1090,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,Two missing children stories are combined to less than compelling effect in this sluggish thriller.
1091,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"None of the actors make much of an impression in Stolen. But then, neither does the film itself."

1106,the_nutcracker_in_3d,critics,rotten,n,"Delivering the cinematic equivalent of a lump of coal in a Christmas stocking, The Nutcracker in 3D is an apparent Scrooge-like attempt by Russian filmmaker Andrei Konchalovsky to forever ruin children's associations with the classic Yuletide ballet."

1113,the_nutcracker_in_3d,critics,rotten,n,"The best part of this variation on the classic ETA Hoffmann story ""The Nutcracker and the Mouse King"" is Elle Fanning, but it's unreasonable to expect a child to support the weight of a resolutely un-magical fantasy film."

1116,the_nutcracker_in_3d,critics,rotten,n,"This non-balletic adaptation by the Russian director Andrei Konchalovsky is something gnarled and stunted and wrong, something that should never have been allowed to see the light of day. How's that for a holiday-ad pullquote?"

1122,the_nutcracker_in_3d,audience,0.5,p,"This movie was absolutely horrible in every way. Between the odd and offensive plot, horrifying CGI, and visually unappealing SFX. This movie is pure nightmare fuel, definitely not suitable for children, and not appealing enough in any sense to be enjoyable for adults. Watching this movie make me feel like the bleach under my kitchen sink would be better suited for washing my eyes out, than for cleaning my vomit after watching this horrific movie."

1124,the_nutcracker_in_3d,audience,0.5,p,"...Somehow, the fact that this has a 0% here on Rotten Tomatoes makes me VERY uncomfortable. :/

I saw another review on YouTube, and from what I saw, even the darkest kid-friendly Don Bluth film looks cute and cuddly next to this horror movie. (Yes, I went there.)

I have to agree with The Nostalgia Critic, the film is WAY too dark for the target audience. I'll do a full review later, but dang... This film is messed up."
1125,the_nutcracker_in_3d,audience,0.5,p,This abomination offers no value to the original story that I felt more emotion from in a local theatre production with a budget that would dwarf the scale and price it took to make this film.

Surely everyone sees this as one of the worst movies of all time."
1130,the_nutcracker_in_3d,audience,1.0,p,"And why did this movie bomb so hard, I wonder? At least the tagline was accurate. Can't fault them for that. The acting is as wooden as the Nutcracker himself, save for John Turturro's hammy performance, the CGI and makeup effects look absolutely nightmarish and they actually added LYRICS to Tchaikovsky's ballet music. To say nothing of what the rats are being depicted as. What the hell was the director's problem there? But some of the visuals are nice. Does The Nutcracker In 3D deserve all the hate? YES, IT DOES!!!"
1131,the_nutcracker_in_3d,audience,0.5,p,"Just seen this movie with my nephews and all I can say is I regret even looking at the cover. The story is nothing like a Christmas film with There nazi rats, creepy nutcracker design and the toys that are said to be alive get burned in a fire. Do not watch, Have your family watch a Stephen King move it is way less scary."
1132,deuces_wild,critics,rotten,n,Scott Kalvert's attempt at a gangster picture is the worst film of 2002.
1133,deuces_wild,critics,rotten,n,"Maybe if the movie had left all the expensive period artifacts, and most of the hackneyed script, on the street corner and let its capable young cast loose, Deuces Wild would have offered the audience a more interesting game."
1134,deuces_wild,critics,rotten,n,"It's full of sound and fury, and the ensemble tries hard, but mob boss Fitzy has it right: They're just kids who need to grow up."
1135,deuces_wild,critics,rotten,n,"This clichd tale of combative Brooklyn street gangs in the late 1950s gets it so wrong in so many ways, it's almost cruel to count them."
1136,deuces_wild,critics,rotten,n,Deuces Wild's not worth anteing up the ticket price.
1137,deuces_wild,critics,rotten,n,"A repellent orgy of gratuitous violence and hackneyed melodrama, Deuces Wild marks a grim nadir for everyone involved."
1138,deuces_wild,critics,rotten,n,"It not only promotes every stereotype and invokes every clich of Brooklyn lore, it combines them all into an insulting composite, fuses that to the chrome-and-fins of the pointless Fifties, and then -- weirdly -- pretends it's Shakespeare."
1139,deuces_wild,critics,rotten,n,"Skip it. Just fill in the blanks and you too can brew the same bland, goopy mixture."
1140,deuces_wild,critics,rotten,n,"A flashback to a heroin casualty on a rain-soaked playground is a crucial visual aid, but any punch-drunk victim of Deuces Wild might prefer the needle to the damage done."
1141,deuces_wild,critics,rotten,n,"This is a movie that can't say no to a melodramatic opportunity, and whatever verisimilitude inspired Paul Kimatian and Christopher Gambale to write a script based on Kimatian's memories of the gangs has been utterly lost along the way."
1142,deuces_wild,critics,rotten,n,Slow-motion shots of swaggering tough guys punctuate this painfully hackneyed gang drama set in late-50s Brooklyn.
1143,deuces_wild,critics,rotten,n,"The script from first-timers Paul Kimatian and Christopher Gambale requires Dillon to say corny things like: 'Bricks don't fall outta the sky in this neighborhood unless I'm throwin' 'em.' Tony Soprano, he ain't."
1144,deuces_wild,critics,rotten,n,"What died in here, and who can we call to take its carcass away?"
1145,deuces_wild,critics,rotten,n,"If it was the intention of Kalvert, Gambale and Kimatian to infiltrate their script with every stereotypical hoodlum clich from every movie covering Brooklyn bad boys, they were on the money. Too bad their movie isn't."
1146,deuces_wild,critics,rotten,n,"Tentando desesperadamente se transformar em uma espcie de O Selvagem da Motocicleta do novo milnio (com toques de Amor, Sublime Amor), o filme  esquemtico demais, tornando-se artificial e nada envolvente."
1147,deuces_wild,critics,rotten,n,"With a couple of plot twists and a few powerful performances, Deuces Wild is worth checking out -- but only on home video."
1148,deuces_wild,critics,rotten,n,"I accuse films of being generic and unoriginal on a regular basis, but rarely have I seen a movie so determined to check off every clich on the list as Deuces Wild."

This is cheap and unsubstantial ""entertainment"".  I've seen worse, but that doesn't make this movie any good.  It blatantly rips off of better coming-of-age gangster films like 'A Bronx Tale' ('I Wonder Why' by Dion DiMucci and The Belmonts is used in the opening scene). 
 A movie riddled with bizarre editing choices and dramatical theatrics that try to convey the ""seriousness"" of the movie's story but instead comes off as melodramatic and often times corny.  Frankie Muniz (Malcolm in the Middle) had no business being in this movie as his character served zero purpose to the central story.  Riddled with generic gang brawl sequences and an abundance of greasers punching each other in slow mo, this is a forgettable film.  It's a shame that so many familiar actors were involved in this squalor."
1153,deuces_wild,audience,2.5,p,"I was gonna go with 3 stars on this movie but went with 2 1/2 stars. I am shocked and not so shocked tbh when I saw the other reviews of this movie. I have heard people in the past say bad stuff about this movie, I never knew why. I have seen this movie many times and I would watch it again and I watch whenever it is on t.v. I liked the movie, the actors, the story, time period etc... in my opinion I think that this movie deserves a lot more love then it gets be kind to this movie give it a watch. If you watch it and find out that it is not your cup of tea that's fine too."

1155,deuces_wild,audience,5.0,n,absolutely one of the best movies ever made.  amazing cast and great story.
1156,deuces_wild,audience,2.5,p,Started reasonably well but just became a very mediocre and predictable film almost like a budget film in the end.
1157,deuces_wild,audience,1.0,p,"It's like a 12 year old boy dreamed up this film and wrote the script. Very tough neighborhood dreamed up nonsense with a love story in it. That for scene in the park is ridiculous. There are a few good performances, by Reedus mainly. Tough cliche Italian neighborhood flick, again something I would have written when I was like 12 years old."
1158,deuces_wild,audience,5.0,n,Brilliant movie! It was sort of like a Bronx Tale mixed in between.
1159,deuces_wild,audience,0.5,p,The Kuffs of 2002.....too self aware with one really $hitty script.

I enjoyed ten glorious minutes of this film when I feel asleep in the cinema, before waking to realise the torture hadn't ended, and I had another half an hour to endure.

The cat was entertaining, though. The worst out of Vanguard Animation's holy trinity of bad animated features they released in the decade and only stands out for how it, alongside the comparatively much better Shrek the Third, led to the decline of this specific type of spoof film."
