0,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,Episode 45: The Farewell / Jackie Brown / Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood
1,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,Bring a box of tissues... [Awkwafina] is super darling.
2,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Lulu Wang's The Farewell is a particularly articulate piece of filmmaking. It beautifully captures the sense of alienation of a child of two cultures, and finds warmth and humour in little family moments."
3,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Lulu Wang's The Farewell is bittersweet in the truest sense of the word, balancing on the knife edge of grief and joy."
4,the_farewell_2019,critics,rotten,n,"The movie wants you to believe that there are no easy answers [...] But unfortunately, there are easy answers here, and The Farewell did not do a good enough job of convincing me that this lie was necessary or ethical."
5,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"No matter where you come from, you'll likely find some point of connection with The Farewell. The film's themes of love and loss resonate far beyond its Chinese location, thanks to a talented cast and deft writing and directing."
6,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Isn't this life? Nobody really knows, we just do the best we can."
7,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,It is remarkable that Wang created this film...steeped in Chinese and Chinese-American culture and yet has a message so strong that it can appeal to wide audiences.
8,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"A slow burn, a movie that builds to a poignant climax that not only feels earned but deserved."
9,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"A profound meditation on young vs. old and East vs. West, [The Farewell] looks to bridge a generational and cultural divide...through reconciliation and understanding."
10,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"It is exactly what it is, unapologetically. A funny, sweet, heart-felt, heart-wrenching film about family, identity, love and loss."
11,the_farewell_2019,critics,rotten,n,"Such an average, uneventful, small, intimately-designed, down-to-earth, slice-of-life drama that very little of it is memorable."
12,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,The fact it's based on writer-director Lulu Wang's real life experiences only adds the poignancy.
13,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"As authentic and involving as a family drama could hope to be, and one of the most effective takes on the tension between culture and identity seen in the last few years"
14,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,The Farewell packs a powerful emotional punch while still offering plenty of humor to give it some levity.
15,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Wang has produced an utter marvel of a film. The Farewell is a beautiful, resonating gem, fuelled by some standout performances and told with touches of pure grace."
16,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"It's about watching, about waiting. It's when it's at its most natural that The Farewell connects the inside and the outside with an honesty that's hard to resist."
17,the_farewell_2019,critics,rotten,n,"The second film as director of Lulu Wang doesn't move me nor does it seem funny, but I can't deny that it contains a certain intimacy with the intercultural treaty that describes the vicissitudes of a Chinese family. [Full review in Spanish]"
18,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"""The Farewell"" will fill you with the same feeling as Yasujirô Ozu's Japanese masterpiece ""Tokyo Story."" You'll want to immediately pick up the phone, call your grandparents and tell them how much you love them."
19,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Injecting what is a tragic setup with comic elements requires a precarious balancing act from the filmmaker and star alike, but Wang and Awkwafina traverse the tightrope without a wobble."
20,the_farewell_2019,critics,rotten,n,"What follows is a series of hackneyed scenes about the different interpersonal relationships within the family, centering on the heroine's bond with her grandmother."
21,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Thematically, The Farewell is about reconciliation with the past and wrestling with cultural traditions that now seem foreign in a country that once was home. But it's also simply about grappling with loss..."
22,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"The Farewell is a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Simply put, it's one of the best films of the year."
23,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Magnificent screen presence. I thought it was really lovely. I thought it was really funny. I thought it was really moving. You will laugh, you will cry."
24,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Ultimately, it's all about balance, a yin and yang of roots and identities, humour and pathos that comes together into a satisfying, bittersweet wedding banquet of a movie."
25,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,You'll be spewing with tears before the first act is done.
26,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"A lovely, warm family picture featuring a star-making turn from Awkwafina."
27,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Wang's family story is modestly affecting and deserves an audience, but if it does prompt thoughts about weighing up the importance of emotional truth, they mainly come afterwards."
28,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"There are no grand declarations or tear-stained confrontations, as it's not Downton, mercifully. And if you think grandma knows the truth and is fooling everybody else, you will need to think again, as it's just not clichéd in this way."
29,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,Panic and self-doubt are at the heart of [the] movie...
30,the_farewell_2019,critics,rotten,n,"The film could have had wit, attitude, poignancy, style - or any single one of the four. Instead it slithers along, shallow and soapy."
31,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Immigrant in-jokes abound but this isn't a niche film, it's a crowd-pleaser that's been a box-office hit in the US. Not every scene works but it's an enjoyable watch and Awkwafina is a revelation in a central role."
32,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Goes softly-softly on the Big Themes, but packs an emotional wallop."
33,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Both a vehicle for Awkwafina's formidable talents and an incredibly charming ensemble piece. If there's any justice, it'll be remembered when it comes to award-scattering season."
34,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"This is an intricately constructed, deeply personal and surprisingly funny story - one of the real highlights of 2019 in cinema"
35,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"There's plenty of humour, especially in the lengthy wedding sequence with its speeches and songs; but the film's main strength lies in its sympathetic examination of the differences between the Chinese who have never left China and their cousins..."
36,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Immigrants, for whom such experiences often overlap in intimate ways, can tell some of the most compelling stories about the human condition and the dislocating shocks of modernity."
37,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Launches no thunderbolts, no dazzling revelations. The film is too gentle for that, with too much affection for its characters."
38,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,A charming portrait of a family struggle. Beautiful performances and an unexpected--and very welcome--ending.
39,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Awkwafina finds her footing as a first-time leading lady, excelling with her emotionally nuanced and vibrant performance in a story about familial love and the gray area one cultivates from straddling different homelands."
40,the_farewell_2019,audience,5.0,n,"Wonderful, truly moving and a good reflection on family and grief. Thank you."
41,the_farewell_2019,audience,0.5,p,"One of the rare instances of me aborting the watching of a movie.  The premise of the story is very interesting, but it was mostly sub-titled Mandarin spoken language AND (more importantly) most of the sub-titles were white text on a white or light background. No English overdub available.  Impossible to comprehend the dialogue and story."
42,the_farewell_2019,audience,4.5,n,This is an impressive debut by Wang! This was a beautiful story of cultural identity and family ties. It's great to see Awkwafina show off her acting skills in this heartwarming drama.
43,the_farewell_2019,audience,4.5,n,"A poignantly told story based on a real lie, moving, ridiculous, hilarious, sad, an emotional rollercoaster. Great movie making."
44,the_farewell_2019,audience,5.0,n,reality that happens a lot in a family. from this I know that a sound mind will save man. Simple but beautiful story
45,the_farewell_2019,audience,3.5,n,"Summary: Billi scrapes up the money to fly to China in order to say goodbye to her dying grandmother. Based on a true lie, the grandmother turns out to be the only family member that doesn't know she's ill. 

Takeaways: This movie amplifies the American-Chinese cross-cultural experience. Come along for family conflicts, a fake wedding scheme, and moral dilemmas."
46,the_farewell_2019,audience,1.0,p,i dont even know why its called The farewell when its just chineese
47,the_farewell_2019,audience,3.5,n,"It makes you laugh, it makes you cry and it has an interesting plotline.  What more could you ask for.  The dialogue is superb and it makes you feel like you're listening to real conversations."
48,the_farewell_2019,audience,3.5,n,It's worth a watch but a little overrated. It is great that Hollywood is making movies of diversity and different cultures. Some of the writing just feels a little forced.
49,the_farewell_2019,audience,5.0,n,"This family comedy drama, directed by Lulu Wang, features one of the most powerful and beautiful endings in the recent years, which is by itself enough for the recommendation. Add to this story a big family gathering, whose members are facing the possibility of losing their loving matriarch and you'll get a universally relatable picture, in this case painted in Chinese American colors. Central part of the movie belongs to the touching relationship between grandma and granddaughter, masterfully played by Shuzhen Zhao and Awkwafina."
50,the_farewell_2019,audience,5.0,n,We enjoyed it very much. Very entertaining and funny
51,the_farewell_2019,audience,5.0,n,"Thoughtful portrayal of family dynamics with wonderful characters.  Interesting reveal of customs.
Excellent acting.  Well written script."
52,the_farewell_2019,audience,5.0,n,emotional and funny synth same time. Great movie
53,the_farewell_2019,audience,3.0,n,I thought it was going to be a comedy but it wasn’t at all funny.
54,the_farewell_2019,audience,5.0,n,Loved the idea of family loyalty and tradition.  Food scenes were delicious.  Awkafina was excellent as were other members of the cast.  The director captured scenes in China perfectly.
55,the_farewell_2019,audience,4.5,n,"Touching, heartfelt. A Must see!"
56,the_farewell_2019,audience,4.0,n,Good depictions of Chinese family & culture.  Loved family interactions.  Very careful with politics & having a politically correct view of China but a perfect story about a family & its approach to the impending  death of a beloved matriarch.  Worth seeing & experiencing life in a modern extended Chinese family.
57,the_farewell_2019,audience,5.0,n,"Loved the concept, story, cultural custom explanations, acting, direction"
58,the_farewell_2019,audience,4.5,n,"It was a wonderful family story, told from an often unheard-from perspective.  So unusual -- such a pleasant surprise -- to be wrapped up in such a compelling story without the standard sex/car chase/violence components,"
59,the_farewell_2019,audience,3.0,n,Good storyline. But movie was depressing.
60,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Despite the unexplained language barriers or farfetched plot, this delightfully delicious foray into the unimaginable never becomes preachy or immature."
61,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"This is a film about a rat who becomes a chef in Paris. But it's so much more than that. It's about what a great artist can be, where a great artist can come from, it's about food and how to savour it."
62,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"A love letter to Paris, a valentine to the fine art of cooking, and a gift to film fans of all ages."
63,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,A delectable treat that represents the finest qualities in animation and American cinema.
64,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,Has great vocal performances throughout and is about a character figuring out where they belong and finally being accepted there. I love it!
65,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"That is the (...) imperative message of Ratatouille. Everyone is not an artist, but anyone could be an artist. Because, as living creatures, it is simply what we do."
66,ratatouille,critics,rotten,n,"The studio's latest effort offers beautiful and strikingly realistic animation, but the flawed concept should have been scrapped..."
67,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"I won't spoil the broth, but suffice to say Ratatouille is a bursting with bright flavors, some spice, and deep warmth that settles in your belly and satisfies body and soul."
68,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"There is so much to enjoy and celebrate here, Ratatouille deserves more than a review: it could (and probably will) inspire books about creativity and good taste."
69,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Ratatouille was written and directed by Brad Bird, the guy behind The Incredibles, and while his new movie isn't as brainy as that one, it has lots of lovely touches to appeal to parents as well as kids."
70,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Ratatouille is a triumph that not only pays tribute to the spirit of discovery, but revels in the fun of making a few of its own."
71,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"And there's Remy himself, voiced by irreverent comic Patton Oswalt. Yes, he's a rat, and a pantless one at that, but he's a charming rat."
72,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,The latest from Pixar and Oscar winning writer-director Brad Bird is a fabulously enjoyable parable about the pursuit of excellence and rising above the preconceptions of others.
73,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"It's not just the best animated film this year, it's the best animated film to come out of the U.S. since Bird's last effort, The Incredibles."
74,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Like the snooty restaurant critic Anton Ego (voiced by Peter O'Toole), we enter Ratatouille thinking we've tasted it all, and we leave hoping for seconds."
75,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,It's a great programme for all the family.
76,ratatouille,critics,rotten,n,It's not my favourite Pixar film.
77,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"No restaurant has ever benefited from placing rats in a recipe, but the digital wizards in Pixar's kitchen have cooked up a winning peasant dish in Ratatouille."
78,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Ratatouille is a wonderful, wistful comedy, and a sparkling return to form for the computer animation studio Pixar after last year's lacklustre Cars."
79,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"As in his previous films, Bird offers up a story with substance."
80,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"This is a film about a rat who becomes a chef in Paris. But it's so much more than that. It's about what a great artist can be, where a great artist can come from, it's about food and how to savour it."
81,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,It's a great programme for all the family.
82,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Ratatouille is a wonderful, wistful comedy, and a sparkling return to form for the computer animation studio Pixar after last year's lacklustre Cars."
83,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Kids are gonna gobble Ratatouille up; adults will relish its wit, and everyone will want to go out to eat after."
84,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"A comedy that relates realistically to life, fashioned not with dozens of hilarious jokes but with due regard for proper storytelling."
85,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Clever, certainly; ingenious, occasionally; enjoyable - hardly ever."
86,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Purveys huge charm, enough to make you fall in love with the rat species and enough, with its array of screen dishes, to make America forgive France, re-dub freedom fries as French fries, and fall sobbing on the country's cordon bleu shoulders."
87,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,Director Brad Bird has created a Pixar movie that's a joy to behold.
88,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"I loved Ratatouille. I was even tempted to drop the odd bit of popcorn, like tipping the waiter after a particularly good meal."
89,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Anton Ego, the restaurant critic of The Grim Eater, is one of the greatest performances of Peter O'Toole's career."
90,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"The animation is superb, the vocal work flawless, the script witty, the central conflict between family ties and the pursuit of excellence subtly handled."
91,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,That feeling you have as you leave the cinema - that buzzing in the fingers and lightness in the heart - is called joy.
92,ratatouille,critics,rotten,n,"Occasionally inspired, but mostly trivial and pointless."
93,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"It's always been Pixar's boast that it keeps its computers in their place -- at the service of the story -- and with Ratatouille, it has proved it yet again."
94,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"A lot of animated movies have inspired sequels, notably Shrek, but Brad Bird's Ratatouille is the first one that made me positively desire one."
95,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,Ratatouille is a veritable feast for the eye and the ear. Don't miss it.
96,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"In Ratatouille, the level of moment-by-moment craftsmanship is a wonder."
97,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,I think Brad Bird is working on another level than most animated writer/directors.
98,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"The original writer and director of Ratatouille, Jan Pinkava, was replaced in midproduction and, for all the exquisite detail, the movie is missing a dash of heart."
99,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"This delicious tale of a rat who cooks is pure joy, a grand achievement -- one of the most beautiful animated pictures ever made."
100,ratatouille,audience,4.5,n,88/90 goooooood very good
101,ratatouille,audience,5.0,n,I love this movie so much I raced a boat my family was on in france so I wouldn't be split up with them but also so I could take a picture of the restaurant this movie was based on
102,ratatouille,audience,5.0,n,This film is the definition of a masterpiece
103,ratatouille,audience,5.0,n,"My favorite movie of all time, very compelling and very calming basically memorized every scene."
104,ratatouille,audience,4.5,n,i love how this movie tells that food can hug people when they need
105,ratatouille,audience,5.0,n,"One of Pixar's best movies! Remy, a rat, is an aspiring chef and finds a way to realize his dream in Paris. As with every film, Pixar ups the game in animation. The water, fire effects are great as is the movement of the rat characters. The human characters are stylized, but believable in a cartoonish way. Brad Bird does an amazing job as director/writer and crafts an excellent story. Patton Oswalt is great as Remy and Peter O'Toole is a perfect cast as Anton Ego. The writing is also well done, Ego's review near the end of the movie is a highlight. An amazing film, go see it!"
106,ratatouille,audience,4.0,n,Very well made and felt very artistic and didn't care to be made for a child audience and go all kidish. It even went into a partial emotional route which was a well surprise. Rating A-
107,ratatouille,audience,3.0,n,Kinda weird they let the rats run the kitchen but you do you I guess...
108,ratatouille,audience,4.0,n,"One of the best Pixar movies ever made, Brad Bird is an amazing director, the movie can be enjoyable for all ages."
109,ratatouille,audience,5.0,n,This movie is absolutely brilliant on every conceivable level. Brad Bird proves again that he is one of the top animated movie directors. The story of the unlikely hero is incredible and written with great purpose. The visuals in this movie are breathtaking. Remy's first sight of Paris is one of the most beautiful animated movie shots ever and the ending monologue from Anton Ego and the way it is presented is the cherry on top of this breathtaking and incredible film.
110,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Chicken Run, if anything, offers an alternative to a desolate world that many of us are increasingly afraid of."
111,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,So great.
112,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Its plump chickens maintain that strange, haptic quality that makes you yearn to reach out and squeeze them."
113,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Even without Wallace and Gromit, most of the trademark joys are here: the compound of squashy creatures and heavy machinery, the wide, open-ended rictus of a toothy smile, and the great Parkian gulp."
114,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"It coaxes you to laugh and cry, flatters your intelligence, and practically guarantees a cheap night out: at dinner afterward, no one's going to be ordering anything but salad."
115,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,It's a warm-hearted and amusing entertainment that your children will enjoy.
116,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Chickens are inherently funny, like nature's idea of a very practical joke. Park and Lord have just improved the old rubber chicken gag, making it movable, turning it into something closer to who we are and what we know as humans."
117,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,Chicken Run is a charmingly conceived entertainment. But it's a little bit twee.
118,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,What gives this movie its oddly strong grip on a viewer's heart is a physical tenderness inseparable from the nature of claymation.
119,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"The claymation comedy Chicken Run is eggsactly what the doctor ordered. It's a witty, high-spirited adventure that will appeal to moviegoers of all ages. Call it chicken soup for the funny bone."
120,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"The first feature film from England's Aardman Animation, and the first truly terrific film to be released by DreamWorks."
121,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Most of the time Chicken Run entertains, instructs, involves and enchants."
122,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,Run to Chicken Run. This clay-animation comedy is the most entertaining animal story since Babe.
123,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"The film is brilliantly voiced across the board, with special notice to Mel Gibson as Rocky and Julia Sawalha as Ginger."
124,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"The sly, sardonic flight of fancy known as Chicken Run is a delightful epic of fowl deeds, quests for freedom and poultry heroics from the off-kilter English cartoon house, Aardman Animation."
125,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Like Wallace & Gromit, it's a paean to British eccentricity, equal parts cluelessness and hopefulness, full of English slang and dry Brit humor."
126,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Indeed, it's the best movie comedy to come out of England since Monty Python packed up the circus."
127,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Chicken Run contains some gorgeous, destined-to-be-classic set pieces, and this is where the Aardman production team flex their animation muscles."
128,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"It's nothing less than a stop-motion tour de force, bursting with charm, humor, invention and eye-popping mise en scene."
129,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"With its winking homages to films like Stalag 17 and The Great Escape, Run is visually inventive, its characters plump with personality and, for a bunch of chickens, ever so brave."
130,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Chicken Run, if anything, offers an alternative to a desolate world that many of us are increasingly afraid of."
131,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Its plump chickens maintain that strange, haptic quality that makes you yearn to reach out and squeeze them."
132,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Even without Wallace and Gromit, most of the trademark joys are here: the compound of squashy creatures and heavy machinery, the wide, open-ended rictus of a toothy smile, and the great Parkian gulp."
133,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"It coaxes you to laugh and cry, flatters your intelligence, and practically guarantees a cheap night out: at dinner afterward, no one's going to be ordering anything but salad."
134,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,Chicken Run is a charmingly conceived entertainment. But it's a little bit twee.
135,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Most of the time Chicken Run entertains, instructs, involves and enchants."
136,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,Run to Chicken Run. This clay-animation comedy is the most entertaining animal story since Babe.
137,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"This first feature by Nick Park and Peter Lord, the team that brought you Wallace and Gromit, is a diabolically witty piece of work, a haymaker."
138,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Apart from looking like no other type of animated film, Chicken Run stands alone in its unwavering determination not to play down to the kiddies."
139,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Chicken Run isn't just chock-full of references to classic prison-break movies and some witty inside Hollywood jokes, but is filled with a secret ingredient sadly missing from its super-digitized, merchandise-driven counterparts: heart."
140,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"It is not only an amazing technical accomplishment, it's also the wittiest and best-voiced animated movie to come along in years."
141,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,Chicken Run boasts the most delicious collection of desperately funny Brits since The Full Monty. Poultry has never been so stuffed with personality.
142,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"The finale and a scene set inside the pie-making machinery prove that the Rube Goldberg formula is infallible, and the puns -- another staple of crossover animation -- range from ""fowl"" to ""poultry in motion."""
143,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"The level of invention on display, from the vividly detailed models and figurines to the gallery of memorable supporting characters, is astonishing at any length."
144,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,Fab animation from Wallace and Gromit creator.
145,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,Exactly the picker-upper this macho-movie summer needs.
146,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,It'd be churlish to carp about this triumph of craftsmanlike technique.
147,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"The poultry cast are capable of an extraordinary range of expression, especially during the sad or mildly scary scenes."
148,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"May not maintain quite the same frantic level of invention as the Wallace and Gromit shorts, but it has more heart."
149,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Fans of the more subversive Wallace and Gromit tales are almost bound to be somewhat disappointed by this safer, more mainstream effort."
150,chicken_run,audience,4.0,n,"The voice acting is great, jokes smart, and great action sequences.  The movie uses animals as surrogates for our hopes and fears with the chickens running through one failed escape after another."
151,chicken_run,audience,3.5,n,"An amusing claymation-style stop-motion movie (similar to ""Wallace & Gromit"") about friendship, helping others in need and teamwork. With slapstick-style comedy, the film is fun for parents as well as kids."
152,chicken_run,audience,5.0,n,"Truly one of the defining cinematic works of our time—and no, this isn't some joke review.  Aardman carries the entirety of the claymation genre on its back, and rightly so.  The voice acting, the jokes, the plot, the SUBTEXT (yes, you heard me right, a G RATED MOVIE has a deeper subtext)...it's just stunning."
153,chicken_run,audience,2.0,p,something about this movie just makes me not like it
154,chicken_run,audience,5.0,n,"I used to watch it when I was a child. After 15 years, this movie is still fresh and enjoyable. The stop motion is amazing. Moreover, i found out this is an ecological and environmental reinterpretation of the Holocaust and it made me appreciate the movie even more"
155,chicken_run,audience,3.5,n,Clever story and funny to watch
156,chicken_run,audience,3.0,n,"While Chicken Run has a great animation style and compelling characters, the plot of the film was too generic and cliche for me."
157,chicken_run,audience,2.0,p,"I guess I'm part of the minority who isn't that impressed with the animation. The story is interesting and I get the holocaust parallels. But it just didn't keep my interest, even with the short run-time."
158,chicken_run,audience,3.0,n,"On one side we have chickens as symbols for humanity.
On the other side we have fried chicken, baked chicken, pineapple chicken, lemon chicken, coconut chicken, pepper chicken, chicken soup, chicken stew, chicken salad, chicken and potatoes, chicken burgers, chicken sandwich and chicken parmesan.
You get the idea."
159,chicken_run,audience,5.0,n,"This movie was already way ahead of it's time back when it was released. It's not the story of ""an america  rooster who falls in love with a British chicken"", it is literally the story of a group of women enslaved workers joining forces to escape a Nazi working camp
Spoilers:
This movie has simply amazing dynamics between women, be it friendship, disagreement, protection, union, hopelessness... and the story of their visionary leader, willing to sacrifice herself so that those she lead could experience freedom. Her friendship with Mac, a woman engineer, is heartwarming especially when they see the fruit of all their hard work: their plane is ready.
Rocky is your regular selfish overconfident man, that is, until his character development brings him to be honest, to not turn a blind eye to those suffering around him, to care, and ultimately to find the courage and dignity to join the chickens' cause. Over his character development, he also finally becomes worthy of the amazing woman (or hen) Ginger is."
160,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"For me, it didn't fulfill the promise of Infinity War, but it did fulfill the promise of the previous twenty movies."
161,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"I'm just grateful to have the privilege to watch this along with the rest of the world. It's not perfect, but it has been one hell of a ride."
162,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"Here's the other really neat thing about Endgame: it made me think of priorities in life and what or who is worth sacrificing for, especially loved ones..."
163,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,The true superteam event releases marked something slightly different and spectacular...End Game over the original Guardians by a hair...
164,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,This goes beyond the usual scale.
165,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,A film that somehow manages to be as epic as fans hope and as dramatic as the MCU deserves.
166,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"Films don't come any huger than this: the closing chapter to an 11-year saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, told across some 22 movies. And by the end of its three-hour runtime, there will definitely be tears."
167,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,There really is very little that could be improved about Endgame. There's certainly no more that could be thrown at it.
168,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"So much of the art form is about storytelling, and bringing so many side stories and characters to a satisfying conclusion is tough, and the film blended a (rather) unpredictable plot with emotional character beats deftly..."
169,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"Avengers: Endgame is everything Marvel fans could want and more. It will be interesting to see how the MCU moves into the future after the events in the film, but woe be upon anyone who doubts their ability to adapt and succeed mightily."
170,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,I found Avengers: Endgame wonderfully satisfying.
171,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,There are [Marvel] movies that have been just as entertaining and a lot smarter than this one.
172,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"Feels like the end of the old cycle, the beginning of a reset. Old favourites gone, passing the mantle to others before they go. We even see a poster that reads, ""Where do we go, now that they're all gone?"""
173,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"The MCU is the ultimate long game, and Endgame feels like its glorious final lap."
174,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"Terms like masterpiece and game-changer are often thrown around a bit hastily, but not on this occasion."
175,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"The fight scenes, while chaotic and intermittently exhilarating, are unable to avoid repetition; such is the nature of invincible entities dueling other invincible entities."
176,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"""Avengers: Endgame"" was a wonderful surprise, filling almost every minute (all 181 of them) with excitement, drama, humor, and visually interesting and entertaining intrigue."
177,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,What The Russo Brothers did here is take high expectations and blow them out of the water with an emotionally thrilling finale. Get ready to be moved!
178,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,The only thing that I know for sure has ended with the Marvel Cinematic Universe is my patience.
179,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"Endgame is nothing short of a deserved send-off to the Infinity Saga, stamping an impressive mark on the cultural psyche. It has been one hell of a ride."
180,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"It is this part of the story, the human side, to narrow it down to our marginal planet, that holds the movie together for its three-hour run time."
181,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,This is a feat of engineering... I felt a sense of catharsis finishing it.
182,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"It would be nearly unfathomable to have spent more than 20 preceding films with these characters and not feel anything at the end of the sometimes tedious, mostly satisfying Avengers: Endgame."
183,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"What you will be getting when you walk into an inevitably overstuffed movie theater is something singular that reflects our age in a way that none of the MCU films that preceded it have-indeed, very few Hollywood spectacles ever have."
184,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,The 3-hour culmination of 22 chapters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is worth going back in time and watching again.
185,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,The only complaint about Avengers: Endgame is that it raises the bar so high that there may well never be a superhero movie to match it.
186,avengers_endgame,critics,rotten,n,"What's missing from ""Endgame"" is the free play of imagination, the liberation of speculation, the meandering paths and loose ends that start in logic and lead to wonder."
187,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"The final battle is giddily cathartic, but the catharsis arises from prioritising character development over plot and spectacle. This, I imagine, will be the Avengers' legacy."
188,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"The MCU will go on and on, but this chapter - and the American pragmatism vs. American ideals bromance that drove it - have well and truly come to their ""Excelsior! Nuff said!"" moment."
189,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"It's fun to see all these character threads unravel, and knit up, as the movie waddles toward its big but indifferent climax of Avengers versus Thanos."
190,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,Endgame consists almost entirely of the downtime scenes that were always secretly everyone's favorite parts of these movies anyway.
191,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,It feels like a curtain closing...there was an elegance in the way they moved toward conclusion. No fan is going to watch and feel short-changed.
192,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"...A wonderful, rousing payoff in the context of the big battle and as wildly inspiring imagery."
193,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,Avengers: Endgame makes you keenly aware of the passage of this time.
194,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,A rousing finale. Epic in scale and in heart.
195,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"It's overdone and bombastic. A fitting end, in other words, to a franchise cycle of insatiable commercial ambition...and thundering creative swagger."
196,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"Avengers: Endgame should make a lot of people happy for about three hours and one minute, solid. It's all that audiences could have possibly hoped for."
197,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,The MCU has generally successfully balanced planetary and personal stakes. Endgame is a worthy culmination of that storytelling approach.
198,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"There are horror movies and political dramas with premises less nightmarish than the one in ""Avengers: Endgame... This is an interesting approach for a superhero film to take."
199,avengers_endgame,critics,rotten,n,"You can easily duck out during the middle hour, do some shopping, and slip back into your seat for the climax. You won't have missed a thing."
200,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,n,Amazing film considering the build up for the story for over a decade. Amazing.
201,avengers_endgame,audience,4.5,n,4/5 on the extraordinary scale. On the normal scale it is a 15/10.
202,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,n,Perfect movie and perfect ending tribute to captain America and iron man
203,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,n,"A Masterpiece! I absolutely loved everything about that movie, and have watched it over and over again and still absolutely loved it! Amazingly done!"
204,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,n,"Fantastic culmination of MCU storylines! Acting is outstanding and although the movie is long, no scene is wasted. An absolute treat for Marvel fans."
205,avengers_endgame,audience,3.0,n,"Nothing much to see here, just a return to the usual Marvel-movie quality level. It's good to see the non-superhero Iron Man finally removed from the picture, with his only power in being a rich guy and owner of advanced technology (and completely unconvincingly portrayed as being smart enough to build or fix said technology himself; kind of the equivalent of that other grossly overrated rich tech guy character we have IRL in a certain Elon Musk), though sadly they did have to turn him into The Great Martyr to get him over with.

Really the only impressive Avengers movie in a long time was Infinity War, because it actually did something different and interesting, i.e. killing a lot of superheroes, and introduced a really good, complex villain. Beyond that, all they can do is return to their teen-boy oriented Marvel-as-usual movies."
206,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,n,AMAZING I LOVED THE PART WHEN SHARK BOY 360° NO SCOPED MARIO JUDA WHILE LEBRON JAMES DUNKED ON THANOS
207,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,n,PERFECT. I mean everything about this movie is beyond perfection.
208,avengers_endgame,audience,4.5,n,"Intense, enthralling, and emotionally fulfilling in all the right ways, Avengers: Endgame is a cultural phenomenon that deserves all of its acclaim, past, present, and future."
209,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,n,"The final movie of the MCU is the best cinecomic I've ever seen. It manages to culminate the infinity saga in a movie full of heart and love for the original avengers. First act somehow unexpected , which gives a great idea of the ​​pain that persists through the world after 5 years. Second act which is a love letter to the marvelous first adventure of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that lasted 11 years, full of quotes more or less explicit. Breathtaking third act that left me speechless every minute more, leading to the ending that is bittersweet and one of the most beautiful I've ever seen for a film saga. The characters complete 11 years of evolution in a sublime way, Stark and Rogers above all.
This and much more is the pearl of the Russo brothers. Simply in my top 3 of the movies I've ever seen."
210,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,n,"Taaaa tata ta, taaaa tataaaa taaaa (Ave gers score)"
211,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,n,Best Superhero movie of all time.
212,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,n,So nice i saw it twice in two days. Epic ending to a universe i am so sad to see go but so excited to see where it goes from here.
213,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,n,it made me cry and was so amazing!!!
214,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,n,absolutely loved this movie even though I to see some omy favorite characters go.
215,avengers_endgame,audience,4.5,n,"Probably the last good Marvel movie made. No Way Home might turn out decent, but otherwise nothing since Endgame."
216,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,n,what an emotional journey. great way to close the infinity saga
217,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,n,"5 stars, enough said"
218,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,n,It's only the greatest superhero movie ever made.
219,avengers_endgame,audience,4.5,n,A fitting conclusion masterfully weaved by the Russo Bros and Markus and McFeely.  Well done.
220,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,Takes courage to make your first film. But to make it around the conversation of four giants and pulling it off is on another level of guts. Regina King's directorial debut causes intrigue into knowing more about these men. [Full review in Spanish]
221,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,A good hang-out movie that invokes the stage more than the cinema.
222,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"With these guys out in front and King behind the camera, Miami is quite the appealing actors' show. King and her performers capture a fascinating moment in African-American history."
223,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"With fine acting, clear direction and perceptive relevance, One Night in Miami transforms from a strong play into powerful cinema."
224,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"There is so much beauty seeing our people depicted onscreen without the focus being on trauma, but a way through."
225,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"In such politically troubled times, where it seems that any political disagreement creates an unbreachable interpersonal rift, One Night in Miami shows the beauty of productive disagreement and dissent."
226,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"In the end, there's an underlying reason why there has been nothing but praise for Regina King and One Night in Miami."
227,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"As Cooke, Ali, and Brown, Leslie Odom Jr., Eli Goree, and Aldis Hodge are all in the pocket. It's Hodge, though, who brings the most to his character while still recognizably playing Jim Brown."
228,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,Brotherhood and Race Drive the Beautifully Executed 'One Night in Miami'
229,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"An electrifying philosophical fantasia that imagines four towering figures of 1960s America arguing over how to navigate racism as Black men. Enraging, but also thrilling, bursting with cinematic joy."
230,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"What a sure hand Regina King showed in her directorial debut! It's a solid and proven screenplay, yes, but to block and shoot a chamber piece like this requires a lot else."
231,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,Delivers a timely message on the interplay between celebrity and advocacy during turbulent times.
232,one_night_in_miami,critics,rotten,n,"There's no sense of the spiritual and theological foundations of black American survival. Instead, One Night in Miami establishes a cult of celebrity activism, with Malcolm as its deity."
233,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,What if...?
234,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,This is a must-watch film for anyone who needs to learn why Black Lives Matter.
235,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"A whip-smart, well-appointed period drama built around a terrific cast, crackling dialogue and an undeniably inspired premise."
236,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"Reminiscent of Nicolas Roeg's 1985 film Insignificance, which imagined a fictional hotel room meeting between Marilyn Monroe, Albert Einstein, Joe DiMaggio, and Joseph McCarthy."
237,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,A fictional recreation of a gathering of four Black leaders and their sometimes heated conversation about their goals and aspirations.
238,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"Usually, with these kind of films, people get caught up in the historical accuracy...here, they move and shift events around, but really, it embraces the spirit of the time and the characters. Can't speak highly enough for it."
239,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"A film not only of exceptional power and feeling, but of abundant texture and detail as well."
240,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"Usually, with these kind of films, people get caught up in the historical accuracy...here, they move and shift events around, but really, it embraces the spirit of the time and the characters. Can't speak highly enough for it."
241,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,All the acting here is remarkable.
242,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,One of the captivating elements of this 110-minute movie is its one-night setting. We see the men as they were then and only then.
243,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,One Night in Miami... allows us to see these men beyond how history has written them - as figures of pure action and ideology - and as something more relatably human.
244,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"The final moments of One Night in Miami... will haunt you, and they'll remind you: There's still work to do."
245,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"At this moment in time, King's directorial debut arrives like a thunderclap."
246,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"There's a Shakespearean quality to One Night in Miami, wrestling with grand ideas about the complexities of the human experiences through these flawed but noble characters."
247,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"Here King lets narrative ingenuity permeate each frame as she remains behind the camera, drawing us inside this circle of legends, each of whom represents distinct aspects of Black identity and struggle."
248,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"Masterful. It never felt static even though it was all in a hotel room, because of the superb dialogue and the masterful acting."
249,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"During it, I kept toggling back and forth over ""Which one is my favorite?"" Because all the performances are really strong."
250,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"A compelling, well-made movie based on a play. Uniformly well-acted."
251,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"The movie, as shot by Tami Reiker, is rich in visual texture. And the actors, all terrific, serve as able guides through the material."
252,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"As a filmmaker, [King] is a natural, and if ""One Night in Miami"" rarely leaves that hotel room, it never feels less than a movie."
253,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"We don't know the details of that famous meeting of four legends more than half-century ago, but if it was anything like what plays out in One Night in Miami, oh what a night."
254,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"King and the actors at the heart of One Night in Miami make its most quiet moments compelling, letting its audience become a fly on the wall on the fictional fringes of history."
255,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"King proves to be a generous director, giving each character time to shine. And the soundtrack is awesome."
256,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"One Night in Miami is about innocence and experience, and Ms. King, a well-known actress herself, has a cast at her disposal that is capable of enormous subtlety."
257,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,One Night in Miami is an act of imagination. It does not reinvent the wheel. It polishes and clarifies the spokes -- all while moving and entertaining us in the process.
258,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"The film has the feel of theater, focusing on conversation and subtle power dynamics rather than a lot of movement and action. But some nimble staging and stunning performances from all four of its lead actors make One Night in Miami pulse with energy."
259,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"Director Regina King ignites a powderkeg by casting four dynamite actors as 1964 civil-rights icons-Kingsley Ben-Adir as Malcolm X, Eli Goree as Cassius Clay, Aldis Hodge as Jim Brown, and an Oscar worthy Leslie Odom Jr. as Sam Cooke-and letting them rip."
260,one_night_in_miami,audience,4.0,n,A great story of the struggle to be a public figure. But at times it felt like the movie was dragging on.
261,one_night_in_miami,audience,4.0,n,"Wondered what all the awards were about and now I see.  Great people making a difference in racial equality in their own unique way.  Singing was great, too!"
262,one_night_in_miami,audience,5.0,n,"Electrifying performances from the four leads make this stage adapted, the directorial debut from Regina King never let up. It maintains just enough stage feel to remind the audience where it came from without being too distracting. Its message and dialogue, unfortunately, ring true even today. Ms. King knows her way around behind the camera and I look forward to her next endeavor."
263,one_night_in_miami,audience,1.5,p,This is long and boring.  I learned some things.  But essentially this is a two hour discussion of racism.  It lacked a lot in terms of entertainment.
264,one_night_in_miami,audience,3.5,n,So good. The actors are all incredible and play off each other well.
265,one_night_in_miami,audience,3.0,n,"I had a lot of trouble getting past the part where all of the guys are in the hotel room because Malcolm invited them there under super-false pretenses so that he could railroad them into a sales pitch for his religion. All of the actors did an excellent job with their roles and Odom's singing parts were the highlight of the movie for me, but about 60% of the way through I realized they had wanted me to forgive or forget that Malcolm had not only basically lied to get them all there but then forced them to stay in the room while he took a leisurely stroll to the payphone to have a lengthy conversation with his daughter & to bring a camera back to show them that nobody had any interest in. I think I could've moved on had this been a true story, but since it wasn't it means that someone wrote as a character trait for Malcolm that he was incredibly casual with other people's time, a trait that I doubt he really had. The posturing from the bodyguards wasn't interesting either, but at the end of the day 90% of the movie was watching historical figures interact with each other, and it would've taken more problems than this to have made that an unenjoyable viewing experience."
266,one_night_in_miami,audience,5.0,n,One of the best movies I've ever seen.
267,one_night_in_miami,audience,4.5,n,"Mostly conversation, but great dialogue from interesting characters."
268,one_night_in_miami,audience,1.5,p,"Two words: nothing happens. The plot was nearly as simple as it gets, with most of the film taking place in one hotel room. There were about eight different sets in the entire film - the house at the beginning, the boxing ring, the swimming pool, the hotel room, Malcolm X's house, the hotel roof, the diner, and the TV show at the end. Then the real ending was just some white text on a black background, which felt like a complete cop-out. There was a little bit of suspense when Malcolm X was being followed, but then they didn't do anything, which demonstrated that nothing exciting was going to happen for the rest of the film either. Malcom X's house was on fire for a really short scene, but Malcolm X didn't know how to handle a gun and only his family was shown on screen, again meaning no actual action. As for the dialogue, there was too much of it, and all of it was fictional. The film was just a rambling discussion about being black vs being white, which meant poor pacing. The message has been discussed many times before and felt timed with the current political climate more than anything. The acting was well done but fake at the same time. The characters somewhat lacked depth and came across as rather one dimensional because the dialogue was repetitive. For instance, Muhammad Ali spent the entire film repeating derivatives of 'I am the greatest'. They also weren't given proper introductions, so if you've never heard of them before, you'll be completely lost. However, the cinematography was decent, the visual effects were fine, the sets/props/costumes looked the part, and the soundtrack was all right, although the singing seemed rather edited. Overall, the film could have been so much more than four actors walking around a room arguing about races and discrimination."
269,one_night_in_miami,audience,3.5,n,"Although obviously based on a one-room stage play, the director skillfully stages this adaptation with imaginative camerawork and several flashback scenes; moreover, the four main actors manage to present their interactions with drama, suspense and humor."
270,one_night_in_miami,audience,5.0,n,"The historic aspect as well as the music, set locations & wardrobe. You could really feel the intensity of the moment."
271,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,Small details... give weight to a story about an immaterial person. [Full review in Spanish]
272,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"A thriller whose mandate is to startle its audience with surface-level shocks while simultaneously subverting expectations in a deeper way, dropping us out of our comfort zone toward some sunken place."
273,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"He (Whannell) uses the cinematic language to his advantage, moving the camera in ways which show that he is in complete control of his audience."
274,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,Imbues its classic horror story with real-life terror.
275,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Though influenced by the earlier film, Writer-Director Leigh Whannell reworks outdated elements and comes up with a surprisingly relevant take on the powers provided by invisibility."
276,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"It's fast and violent but crystalline in clarity...letting us experience the violence, shame, confusion, and anger that Cecilia does rather than explaining it to us."
277,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,From the film's opening titles you can tell you're in for something special.
278,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,This film - with its science-fiction slant - delivers scares and works as a heightened examination of obsession and an abusive relationship.
279,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,Leigh Whannell's update of the classic concept stars Elisabeth Moss as the ex-girlfriend of a millionaire inventor turned high-tech gaslighter whose goal is to erase his victim's humanity as effectively as he has obscured his own visibility.
280,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,rotten,n,"The film falls into stale traps, ones so basic and obvious that it's almost maddening to see them regurgitated for yet another rote thriller."
281,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"With some great acting and solid storytelling, The Invisible Man has only strengthened the legacy of Wells' story."
282,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Timely, relevant, and genuinely terrifying...The Invisible Man recontextualizes a classic Universal monster into a modern examination of abuse, toxicity, and gaslighting."
283,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,It's doubtful any of The Invisible Man would work so well ... without Moss.
284,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Staring, waiting, preparing for the worst creates the most unease in the viewer ... Whannell's script is equal parts action, suspense and surprise. He doesn't go for the easy scare, and much of the film is anxiety-inducing, not seat-jumping."
285,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"'The Invisible Man' displays how victims can be in constant danger, whether they're at home or in a crowded room."
286,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The Invisible Man is one of the best horror movies in recent years and, of course, one of the best movies of 2020."
287,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Whannell's simmering long shots get under the skin, the ambient soundscape is successfully designed to terrify."
288,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Anchored by a raw performance from Elisabeth Moss, The Invisible Man cements Leigh Whannell's spot in the horror directors' Hall of Fame."
289,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"I may not have seen every invisible man remake and sequel there is, but of all the ones I have seen this is the best, even better than the original 1933 classic starring Claude Rains (which nevertheless was a technological marvel for its day)."
290,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Anchored by another awesome performance by Moss, this urgently topical reworking of the HG Wells tale is a terrifically gripping thriller - and a brilliant metaphor for hidden coercive control."
291,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"A thriller whose mandate is to startle its audience with surface-level shocks while simultaneously subverting expectations in a deeper way, dropping us out of our comfort zone toward some sunken place."
292,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"There's a lot more to think about than a typical horror film. It's a real psychological thriller...a good strong film, not SCARY scary, but it gets in your head."
293,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The prize asset is Moss, of course, a seven-octave actor equally happy with micro-emotion and going very big indeed."
294,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"In their re-imagined The Invisible Man, filmmaker Leigh Whannell and actress Elisabeth Moss attack the patriarchy and affirm rich white tech bros as the enemy."
295,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Ultimately, The Invisible Man makes for a pacey, if mostly predictable, reimagining of a classic Hollywood horror terror."
296,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,[Elizabeth Moss is] amazing and she does so much just with her eyes. It's a really demanding role physically [and] emotionally; it's a huge range she has to play.
297,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,This is far removed from what you might be expecting.
298,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Whannell is brilliant at distracting us with amusing, knowing dialogue (siblings are rivalrous; architects are trendy; waiters are irksomely urbane). Death comes when you least expect it."
299,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Moss is terrific as a woman who believes (or says she believes) her not-dead husband has come back, masked by an invisibility he has created..."
300,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,rotten,n,"A bracingly modern #MeToo allegory that, despite its brutal craft, rings hollow."
301,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Abusers keep their victims under their thumbs, even when they're absent. That's plenty shocking on its own, and now is just the right time to be telling this story, this way, as a piece of effective entertainment with a core of instinctual horror."
302,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"A smart, unexpected delight."
303,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Whannell uses stillness and empty spaces against the audience expertly. But it's Moss who most sells this new, self-consciously serious take on a hammy monster movie premise."
304,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,rotten,n,"While chock full of relatively good scares, campy effects and an ending that will tickle a very specific demographic of 1990s and 2000s thriller fans with glee, The Invisible Man doesn't deliver more than that."
305,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,Subverting the original text's point of view allows Whannell to privilege his female protagonist while continuing to explore the novel's theme of untrammelled power.
306,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Whannell has gone back to basics crafting a grounded, deeply unsettling character-driven thriller."
307,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"In this heart-stopping update, the 'Gotcha!' moments really do surprise."
308,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,There's some cruelty in this visual; there are moments when The Invisible Man is not fun to watch. But the movie's violence opens up a larger question...
309,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,rotten,n,"[Elisabeth Moss] is a victim in this movie for a long, long time, and I didn't really care for that."
310,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Despite its lack of pretense, there are actually layers of intelligent subtext curling beneath the standard horror plot."
311,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,2.0,p,"Totally forgettable. Kinda cool, but these ratings are just… silly really."
312,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,5.0,n,Incredible film. Great theme. Ending made me jump out of my seat.
313,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,2.0,p,"It was somewhat predictable. Not worthy of Elisabeth Moss' talent. Not bad, just not great."
314,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,4.0,n,"I did not expect to like this film as much as I did. Interesting story well made, and definitely worth two hours of your time."
315,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,2.0,p,Wow!! Galway through the movie I began to root for the invisible to just kill her do the movie would end. How do directors watch a scene and not see the stupidity? Elizabeth Moss has a gun 5 inches from her and decided to grab it after about 8 policemen die? Seriously? A policeman sees something and decides to reach for a taser 10 seconds later?
316,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,3.5,n,"There are a lot of things not working in the film but then again, all horror films are flawed. The first part is strange and I didn't connect with the characters much. The thrill starts when ... oh, I'm not giving info about the best part, the last 1/3 of the film."
317,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,3.5,n,"I was losing interest in the rather slow first half of the movie. However, It does pick up dramatically and became a much more tense and interesting movie thereafter.
Worth the watch and Elizabeth moss is excellent in it."
318,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,2.5,p,"It was ok, trailer was more promising I'd say and in the end just weird."
319,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,1.0,p,"Wish I can make this film invisible.
1/2 star for directing that was clunky and cheap horror movieish. 

0 stars for another film ripping off a classic title, bastardizing from the true title origin and from future use.
 
1/2 star for Elizabeth Moss fair acting - but she over did it and failed to create a sympathetic character.  She came off as unlikeable to all other characters, so we did not feel empathetic to her survival.  The more I watched it the more I wished she would disappear."
320,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,1.5,p,Very entertaining. Interesting take on the invisible man. cheap-predictable rushed ending that insults the viewers intelligence.
321,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,5.0,n,Your review will help others decide whether to watch.
322,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,3.5,n,She got a raw deal with that husband lol. Good acting
323,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,5.0,n,Amazing storyline. Amazing acting. This movie gave me anxiety and had me on the edge of my seat the whole damn time.
324,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,5.0,n,So many unexpected twists and turns! Kept you on edge the entire film :)
325,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,3.5,n,"Pretty good, if a bit long, with enough surprises and plot twists."
326,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,2.0,p,The end was pretty confusing and bad
327,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,3.5,n,"Storyine was good, but many parts were too unrealistic."
328,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,5.0,n,great movie to watch suspence and accition
329,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,4.0,n,Very good movie - suspenseful with a few good twists and a great ending!
330,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,3.5,n,"Extremely slow and uneven start and lacks some character history. That being said, once it picks up steam, it gets in your head and is an exceptional psychological thriller. Elizabeth Moss shines. With technology advancing at an exponential rate, there’s not much disbelief to suspend. I recommend it if psychological thrillers are your thing."
331,argo_2012,critics,rotten,n,"Hold your head high, Argo. But, well, not too high. High-ish."
332,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"Students of history will find plenty to carp about, which does slightly spoil the overall effect, but as a searing slice of entertainment Argo is hard to fault."
333,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"The subject matter hasn't lost any of its edge, especially with the continued bedlam in the Middle East."
334,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"Sometimes, it's the most absurd ideas that make for the most compelling stories and cinema."
335,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"After the frame is built, the plan is set in motion, and the tight pace and constant tension zip you along towards one of those finales where, once it's over, you realize that you've been leaning forward and forgot to breathe."
336,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,Argo is a superb thriller. [Full review in Spanish]
337,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,Who would have thought that anyone could have pulled off an audience-friendly comedy/drama on the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis?
338,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"While Argo does have it's flaws, the film strives for overall authenticity."
339,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"Although the partially true story succumbs to some rather silly Hollywood tropes towards the end, ARGO does an engaging job of burnishing both sides of the Affleck coin."
340,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"You cannot call it a comedy, you cannot even call it a straight book-to-film adaptation - but you can call Argo so many other things: a satirical political thriller, gripping, tense...and fantastic."
341,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"A detailed, true story that has some trouble finding its footing between political thriller and suspense movie."
342,argo_2012,critics,rotten,n,The film plays out in the broadest of broad strokes with Affleck employing a lowest common denominator tone that would make the most hackneyed of Hollywood filmmakers proud.
343,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"As a director Affleck's impressive, expanding on the promise he showed in Gone Baby Gone and The Town. He's adopted a much lighter style for Argo, with a zippy curve-ball narrative spins from wit to suspense."
344,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,You've really got to hand it to Affleck.
345,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,Both a riveting spy thriller and an emotionally engaging piece of historical filmmaking.
346,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"This is a movie best seen with as little knowledge as possible, making the surprises (even the ones that are predictable) that much more entertaining."
347,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"It's a smart and hugely enjoyable action thriller as it is, with some wicked humor and a feel-good ending that's manipulative, sure, but was, in part, bequeathed to us by history."
348,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"For any audience, it is a thriller that provides constant rising tension and actual thrills."
349,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"Not only that Argo is both intelligent and entertaining, it's riveting from start to finish."
350,argo_2012,critics,rotten,n,"The action is exciting, the Hollywood scenes are dryly funny. But we never get to know the people for whom this farcical plot has been invented."
351,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"Affleck continues to impress audiences with his keen eye for direction, knowing just when to fall back and allow this top-notch cast the freedom to interpret the events in a way that will most compel viewers."
352,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"Affleck is still building up his chops as a director, but the intelligence and ambition he brings to filmmaking are particularly apparent in Argo."
353,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"The old saw ""truth is stranger than fiction"" has had its teeth properly sharpened in the superb thriller Argo, a blend of political history and Hollywood hijinks that goes right for the jugular."
354,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"The emotional catharsis of Argo isn't what happens onscreen, but the sheer knowledge that the creaky old moviemaking system has put together something this crowd-pleasing and great."
355,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"Ben Affleck has delivered a knuckle-muncher of a thriller and a satire on Hollywood, both in one unlikely package."
356,argo_2012,critics,rotten,n,"Sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction. And sometimes it isn't, and it must be bent and twisted out of shape until any authenticity becomes purely theoretical."
357,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"The cast helps to keep things moving -- particularly the hilarious interplay between Arkin and Goodman. And is it me, or should Bryan Cranston be in every film released?"
358,argo_2012,critics,rotten,n,Only two scenes do more than hint at the poetic potential of the premise.
359,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"Let's just say that the movie's final section is so nail-bitingly tense, thanks to a skillful combination of acting, writing and crosscutting, that it puts Affleck in the big leagues as a director."
360,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,Entertaining and suspenseful in old-fashioned ways.
361,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"Affleck himself turns in a quietly impressive movie star performance. Tony Mendez is a kind of anti-Bourne, comfortable with his anonymity, living off his wits, not his fists."
362,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"The details make for a rip-roaring story, which Affleck invests with old-school directorial élan."
363,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"Surprisingly enjoyable, given that you may have little prior commitment to this story and only mildly fancy Affleck."
364,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"Talent borrows and genius steals, but Affleck does something in between: he mimics."
365,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"It's impossible to be bored by a story this good, especially with that cast."
366,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,Part of what makes this headspinning story believable is the fact that it pans out in an oddly uncomplicated way.
367,argo_2012,critics,rotten,n,"There is an intelligent, funny film waiting to come out of this story; it will have to keep waiting."
368,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"With Affleck's continued growth as a director, it makes you want to see what he will deliver next."
369,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"For 100 minutes, 'Argo' is close to flawless."
370,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"As a director, Ben Affleck is getting into Alan Pakula territory."
371,argo_2012,audience,4.0,n,"Enjoyable action and contains some tension, but it ultimately felt inaccurate and lacked character depth. The story was important to share and perfect for a film. Unfortunately, the characters were abandoned in terms of development in favour of focusing on the plot, and several events were clearly modified for the purposes of drama. On the other hand, the pacing wasn't too slow nor too fast, the acting was believable, the cinematography felt modern, the visual effects were decent, the sets/props/costumes seemed genuine enough, and the soundtrack was catchy and effective."
372,argo_2012,audience,4.5,n,"An edge of your seat movie with dark humor, it recreates the Iran Hostage crisis with incredible attention to detail and tremendous characters.  Ben Affleck does it again with direction as this felt more like a movie from an earlier era- less showy, frenetic and more focused on narrative.  The only knock is there are so many characters, it is hard to develop them all."
373,argo_2012,audience,4.0,n,"Argo ha senza dubbio una sceneggiatura di qualità; che probabilmente pecca di mancanza di azione per essere totalmente adatta al grande schermo.
Forse questo è l'unico punto debole del racconto; il bisogno hollywoodiano di inserire un finale al cardiopalma e denso di suspense, quando probabilmente sarebbe stato meglio attenersi alla storia vera visto il tipo di film.
Molto interessante la narrazione degli eventi che hanno portato a questa assurda missione; a cui giustamente viene data la priorità rispetto al racconto dei personaggi.
Peccato per una prima scena un po' troppo rapida, in cui non si capisce molto bene la sequenza degli eventi."
374,argo_2012,audience,3.0,n,"It might be true that it takes one day to learn to direct, but then it's true that an entire life is not enough to learn writing."
375,argo_2012,audience,5.0,n,Great Movie! Check out Persepolis!
376,argo_2012,audience,3.5,n,"Anxious, engaging, and interesting, but overall, Argo is a commonly played out political thriller."
377,argo_2012,audience,4.5,n,The beginning makes it impossible for me to root for the Americans.  There should be discussions about what happened back then.  I'm guessing there have been discussions and I missed them all.  Movies are important.
378,argo_2012,audience,5.0,n,An old school edge-of-the-seat thriller of the kind they don't seem to make any more. This reminded me what a pity that is.
379,argo_2012,audience,4.5,n,"It was an amazing and intense ride. The only thing I knew about Argo was that it won the Oscar for Best Picture, I didn't expected this incredible film."
380,argo_2012,audience,5.0,n,Very well represented and acting was A1 thoroughly enjoyed it
381,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,A masterpiece within or outside the superhero & comic book genre it explores. Heath Ledger delivers one of the most iconic performances in film history. [Full review in Spanish]
382,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,A rare beast. It's a summer blockbuster with equal parts brain and brawn.
383,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,The famous masked vigilante has never looked or felt more intense.
384,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"With his smeared whiteface make-up and leering razor-slashed smile, Ledger's Joker is creepy enough to look at, but what he represents is even more chilling."
385,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,The awards hype is warranted.
386,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"The Dark Knight managed to capture something complex and instinctive about the ""war on terror"" era."
387,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"A masterpiece. Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight is not only one of the greatest comic book movies you'll ever see, but also one of the best films of all-time."
388,the_dark_knight,critics,rotten,n,It seems almost cruel to take beloved child archetypes and turn them into projections for adult angst.
389,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"Heath Ledger gives one of the best performances of the last twenty years. When you watch his take on the Joker, it's one of complete surprise and mystery. It's frightening with how chaotic and mischievous he makes him."
390,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"Ledger's performance alone is good enough to make The Dark Knight a very good movie, but fortunately this is a film with even more than that -- making it the not just the best film of the summer, but one of the best films of the year."
391,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,The Dark Knight represents a masterpiece in filmmaking as Christopher Nolan takes the Batman Begins sequel to an entirely new level.
392,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,The definitive movie of its genre and the best Batman film to date
393,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,Heath Ledger is great.
394,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"The movie's a real neo-noir all right, wallowing in darkness, thrilled with how bad we are, and getting such a kick out of our impending doom it cheers you right up."
395,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"Not just a perfect comic book movie, not just a perfect Batman movie, but darn-near a perfect movie, full stop."
396,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"A film is only as good as its villain. By that standard, The Dark Knight achieves true greatness."
397,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"The Dark Knight always ought to be played on the biggest screen possible, and played loud, like a Led Zepplin song. Director Christopher Nolans' skyscapes, the helicopter shots and views from the 200th floor, are IMAX at its best."
398,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"It might not be the most fun superhero movie ever made, but it's certainly the most mature, complex and intriguing of them all. [Full review in Spanish]"
399,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"The Dark Knight may not supply a happy ending, but there is a feeling of exhilaration as Batman rides off from the pursuing cops, and the realization that this is another big step forward for comic book movies."
400,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,The action sequences are like being injected with a shot of adrenalin straight into the heart.
401,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie"
402,the_dark_knight,critics,rotten,n,"Too much psychology and not enough pop. It's possible to be too serious, you know."
403,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,You will feel utterly numb after the screening of The Dark Knight. The film is bleak and brilliant.
404,the_dark_knight,critics,rotten,n,"This is an impressive film in many ways, and Nolan directs with real confidence, yet the overall result feels cumbersome."
405,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,Among the great strengths of The Dark Knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts and setpieces you expect in summer blockbusters.
406,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"To talk of Heath Ledger's performance is difficult, merely because, as gigantic as it is, it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas."
407,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"The Dark Knight is probably the smartest and most stylish action movie since the ""The Matrix."" It thinks and philosophizes. The subject it thinks and philosophizes about, perhaps not surprisingly, considering the times, is the Iraq war."
408,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"An exceptionally smart, brooding picture with some terrific performances."
409,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"The Dark Knight is a film that's fantastic on the action front, seeds its acrobatics in its own reality, and always feels relevant even when its ideas are drowned out by clatter."
410,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"Christopher Nolan is much, much smarter than your average filmmaker."
411,the_dark_knight,critics,rotten,n,Flawed and overrated.
412,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"The symbiosis of good and evil is the film's philosophical core, and images of duality and cloaked identity are strewn through it like shards from a fun house mirror."
413,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,[Ledger's] manic zest gives the film its energy.
414,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"You will exit the cinema with an enhanced respect for Nolan's intelligence, for Wally Pfister's pin-sharp cinematography, and, sadly, for an acting talent tragically curtailed."
415,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"Shouldn't Nolan, marvellous as his directing here is, be creating original films rather than rebooting and retooling franchise fare?"
416,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"Watching the first dizzying, vertiginous overhead shot of the glittering skyscrapers and minuscule streets, I literally forgot to breathe for a second or two, and found myself teetering forward on my seat..."
417,the_dark_knight,critics,rotten,n,"Now you see it, now you don't."
418,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"It has chases and crashes and fight scenes, including a somersaulting truck, but when it is over it is the wrenching choices, the internal confrontations, that reverberate."
419,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"I'm betraying my childhood to concede this, but Nolan has finally topped Tim Burton's two twisted spectaculars."
420,the_dark_knight,critics,rotten,n,Christopher Nolan's latest exploration of the Batman mythology steeps its muddled plot in so much murk that the Joker's maniacal nihilism comes to seem like a recurrent grace note.
421,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,n,A cinematic masterpiece about the war against terror and definitely the most accurate Batman movie vibe ever made
422,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,n,"My favorite of the trilogy, the plot is very good, heath ledger portrayed a unsettling, psychotic villain, which is the best joker performance yet. The interrogation scene is just amazing. This is one of the best batman films, Christopher Nolan did a very good job on this film"
423,the_dark_knight,audience,4.5,n,This is the best movie in the trilogy. Ledger brings this home offering the best characterization of the Joker. Sometimes Ledger makes the Joker legit scary. Something I haven't experienced before.
424,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,n,"It's a perfect movie. Everything is well done, the acting is all very good, the special effects adequate, a great direction from Nolan, all the character arcs well done and a joker who always steals the show. Side by Side with Spider-Man 2 in terms of best super hero film (my opinion). (10/10)"
425,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,n,"While ""Batman Begins"" laid the cinematic groundwork for a gritty narrative on the Caped Crusader, this movie miraculously exceeds its predecessor by highlighting the moral dilemma of vigilantism, accompanied with many twists and turns. The titular protagonist exhibits enough screen time of brains and brawn, but it is Ledger's portrayal of the Joker that steals the show as he constantly pushes the hero to his limits, raising the stakes in a battle between order versus chaos. Even though the fight choreography is arguably mediocre, I appreciate the more realistic direction as intended. ""The Dark Knight"" remains the gold standard for the superhero genre."
426,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,n,One of the best Comic book movies Ever
427,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,n,This might just be my favorite superhero movie. It’s a masterpiece
428,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,n,Easily the best comic book adaptation of my generation. Outstanding!!!
429,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,n,"Literally the best super hero movie ever made, it ticks all the boxes. I will watch it time and time again"
430,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,n,Till now is the greatest superhero movie
431,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,n,everything you want in a Batman movie
432,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,n,"Best villain ever! 
Read about all the Heath impromptu scenes."
433,the_dark_knight,audience,4.0,n,"This movie is so full and rich of quality all the way around — sound, effects, locations, sets, film, editing, acting, plot, storyline. The director really brought everything to full manifestation. It will eternally be a well rounded good movie for the ages."
434,selma,critics,fresh,p,"There's a lump in your throat at the of ""Selma,"" a movie that wisely takes a a snapshot of King's life from the moment he wins the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 through the Selma march in 1965."
435,selma,critics,fresh,p,The controversial story of America's civil rights marches prickles with violence and emotion.
436,selma,critics,fresh,p,"A historical document, but so alive and timely, it is essential viewing almost fifty years after King's assassination."
437,selma,critics,fresh,p,Selma is the best kind of biopic (if you can even call it that).
438,selma,critics,fresh,p,"One of the most effective, well-crafted historical biopics that I've ever seen... giving us a moment in history that feels immediately familiar to the moment we are currently living in."
439,selma,critics,fresh,p,"Wisely uses affective montages, orchestral music, tight pacing, and award-worthy acting to supplement the intense recreations of iconic undertakings."
440,selma,critics,fresh,p,Truly a film that must be seen by today's youth so that we can keep Selma and Ferguson from happening in the future.
441,selma,critics,fresh,p,"Selma is worthy of my highest recommendation. Hopefully like me, you'll clap once the end credits roll."
442,selma,critics,fresh,p,"The acting is exquisite, and DuVernay directs with a sure and confident hand. It's not only the story of Martin Luther King Jr.; it's the story of the American People."
443,selma,critics,fresh,p,"Leaves audiences moved and shaken; this is a movie that will resonate and be remembered for a very, very long time."
444,selma,critics,fresh,p,"In bringing together the personal, the political, and the historic, DuVernay has crafted a film that will be remembered and studied for years to come."
445,selma,critics,fresh,p,"...offering not only a superbly-realized presentation of a particular series of events, but also a sense of what it meant to live through the historical period in question."
446,selma,critics,fresh,p,It's the weight of history that gives Selma so much emotional heft.
447,selma,critics,fresh,p,"...[I]n zooming in on one moment, director DuVernay and writer Paul Webb really force us to live in the trial by fire that was the American South in 1965."
448,selma,critics,fresh,p,"As director, DuVernay employs a style of storytelling... that makes it possible for audiences to find the film engrossing, entertaining, and educational."
449,selma,critics,fresh,p,"Selma is spectacularly staged, impressively acted and narratively satisfying. But it is also something much, much more and we need much, much more like it."
450,selma,critics,fresh,p,"Selma tells a great story about a triumphant moment in civil rights history and the losses it took to get that win, but it doesn't nostalgically let us forget that this moment is just a chapter break in a longer war that still rages on today."
451,selma,critics,fresh,p,There is nothing saccharine about Selma. DuVernay does justice to the illustrious subject matter... and that's no mean feat.
452,selma,critics,fresh,p,A very satisfying picture.
453,selma,critics,fresh,p,"In a time where dedicated activists are speaking their own truths to leaders who are often even less responsive, movies such as Selma feel more essential than ever."
454,selma,critics,fresh,p,"One of the most effective, well-crafted historical biopics that I've ever seen... giving us a moment in history that feels immediately familiar to the moment we are currently living in."
455,selma,critics,fresh,p,"Excellent acting, very good directing, a good tight script -- a little bit of pacing issues and... other characters are nowhere near as investing as Martin Luther King is."
456,selma,critics,fresh,p,"If you don't mind the technical confusion it's a gripping story, and a great credit to DuVernay and co-writer Paul Webb who were unable to use King's original speeches for copyright reasons."
457,selma,critics,fresh,p,"Ava DuVernay's Selma is a beautifully observed drama of public and private lives, of personal narratives and historic moments."
458,selma,critics,fresh,p,"Selma is an always-gripping, often-bruising film, with fantastic performances and a solidly written script that contextualizes King's work in an effectively impactful way."
459,selma,critics,fresh,p,I this movie has some of the most powerful moments I've seen I think all year.
460,selma,critics,fresh,p,"Selma is an important movie, yes, but it is also a great one."
461,selma,critics,fresh,p,"There are no wasted moments here. There are no wasted characters. The film is as much about Martin Luther King Jr. as it is about the people he worked with, and fought for."
462,selma,critics,fresh,p,"It is a very, very good movie, beautifully shot by Bradford Young and deftly, almost astonishingly well-directed by relative newcomer Ava DuVernay."
463,selma,critics,fresh,p,David Oyelowo breathes such life into it and makes you feel like you're seeing this person for the first time.
464,selma,critics,fresh,p,"It's extremely difficult to portray a legendary historical figure in a way that does justice to both that figure's momentousness and his humanity, but Oyelowo has found a way to do it."
465,selma,critics,fresh,p,"Even if DuVernay stumbles a bit when it comes to political sausage-making (really, who knows?), the film is dramatically tight and emotionally true."
466,selma,critics,fresh,p,"So, is Selma the film I wanted? No. Is is a good film? Yes, but it's not great."
467,selma,critics,fresh,p,A monumental achievement.
468,selma,critics,fresh,p,"The timeliness of the picture, coupled with the immediacy of the filmmaking, renders 'Selma' more powerful than even its skilled creators could've possibly intended."
469,selma,critics,fresh,p,"Selma isn't a discrete story of one moment in time that we can observe safely from the sidelines. It is all around us, every day."
470,selma,critics,fresh,p,"In compact, economical form, DuVernay sets out her table: the juxtaposition of domestic intimacy and institutional violence; the tension between the personal and political; the vivid interplay between the historical and the contemporary."
471,selma,critics,fresh,p,In some ways it's beyond criticism as the first-ever major movie about this heroic campaigner.
472,selma,critics,fresh,p,The famed American civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr has been strangely under-represented in the cinema. Ava DuVernay's excellent third film thankfully puts this continued omission right.
473,selma,critics,fresh,p,"Selma is a rousing political drama, made with enough verve and passion never merely to seem didactic. Its near complete absence from this year's Oscar nominations is baffling and suggests a double standard."
474,selma,audience,3.5,n,"This was a hugely enlightening viewing experience. I wasn't aware of even half of the finer details portrayed about the marches and how there were so many other leaders under MLK that did a lot of the hard work like that. I had imagined he had a huge cult of personality surrounding him and that he just mustered people to his side whenever he wanted to organize and can see now that that was never the case. I do wish he'd been given the Malcolm X treatment though; this moment in history was certainly worthy of its own movie like this, but I find myself wanting to see more of his life elaborated upon. I did prefer The Butler over this movie for a few reasons that mostly boil down to that movie having simpler source material to adapt; this movie was super chaotic by comparison and because its source material didn't go off without a hitch, watching it happen as a movie leads to non-ideal lurches in pace. It didn't help that this one had so many historical figures in it whose names I was just not at all familiar with & who were so numerous that few received much screentime, causing some confusion in me as I sat through this one."
475,selma,audience,5.0,n,"This is a reminder of the dangers black people faced, and continue to face, simply attempting to access the rights that are promised to them by our corrupt governmen(s)."
476,selma,audience,5.0,n,Historical and moving. this film was played in my high school History class and it was some of the best class days this year. I found myself immersed in the film and I cared a lot about what happened. The film itself was well paced and fairly easy to follow although it was paused several times during the class for explanations. The struggles depicted in this movie are brutal and shocking which largely make up the films conflict. Including the brutality of the police and racism of the town of Selma the film also includes President Johnson who's performance was one of the best as he truly seems like the actual President Johnson. His character is one of the most complicated as he wants to help the protagonist MLK give African Americans the right to vote but he also has other priorities. When MLK won't take no for an answer Johnson makes some dirty moves on Martin in order to stop him from marching on the capitol. He seems to have good intentions but isn't making his citizens right to vote his priority and he also uses harsh language later in the film when speaking with the intolerant governor of Selma. The lead and protagonist Martin Luthor King is a charismatic and driven character. He makes for an incredibly compelling character as he isn't portrayed as perfect by any means but the film intelligently is able to display his flaws and mistakes while still treating him like the hero he is to the civil rights movement. The supporting cast while not playing huge roles in the film or having much character arcs still contribute to the film and every character they follow has their moment good or bad. The end is a little choppy with the use of text to explain what happens after the events of the film but showing what actually happens after the film with the exception of MLK would not have made for a compelling movie and honestly aren't stories worth telling so why they chose to use text is understandable. Overall the film takes an incredible story of a political strategist and minister who through planning and sacrifice was able to lead the African American community to gaining the right to vote. The film is filled with powerful triumph and sadness as obstacles and loss is dealt with but perseverance jumped over the hurdles were able to bring change to a time that treated some Americans as less of a person.
477,selma,audience,5.0,n,There's only one word that can describe this film: Beautiful. Extremely well made.
478,selma,audience,4.5,n,"Ciò che più colpisce di Selma è l'estrema eleganza con cui viene narrata l'intera vicenda; si racconta di pagine nere della storia americana e di personaggi infimi; lo si fa senza far mancare nulla eppure senza essere troppo espliciti o violenti più del dovuto.
Il ritratto di Luther King jr è completo, introspettivo e molto personale; colpisce come si riesca a rendere perfetta la presenza del personaggio; come se lo si conoscesse per davvero.
Il tutto completato da una canzone meravigliosa e meritatamente premiata con un Oscar.
Qualche immagine di repertorio in più su ciò che realmente accadde, sarebbe stata gradita."

481,selma,audience,4.0,n,"I saw this movie when it came out, I was much younger then I am now, and it had a powerful effect on me. Rewatching it now it leaves much to be desired but in the time frame it was released it was powerful."
482,selma,audience,4.0,n,"Except for the portrayal of Lyndon B Johnson, this was an exceptional film! David Oyelowo is incredible as Martin Luther King jr that its shocking to believe he wasn’t nominated for an oscar."

492,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"In case you've missed the point of all this, we enjoyed It Happened One Night tremendously. We can't, to be entirely honest, remember when we've had quite as good a time at a movie."

494,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"Clark Gable does possibly his best work to date and reveals more of a carefree comedy tendency than heretofore. The Colbert performance, too, is excellent."
495,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"The audience gets tired of waiting for what it knows to be inevitable. The redeeming features, however, are the bright and breezy performances by Gable and Miss Colbert."

497,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,Claudette Colbert is a particularly happy foil for Gable. They ought to be teamed up again.

500,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"[It Happened One Night] is a comedy-romance of much more than usual merit. Frank Capra, director, has taken a mediocre and rather hackneyed story, with trite situations. and made it into a grand bit of entertainment."
501,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"This picture has the pulse. With Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert ideally cast, and... Walter Connolly and Roscoe Karns helping things along, it is just about guaranteed to cure any fit of the blues, and maybe even a headache."

511,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"[It Happened One Night] is a swell picture which will be aided considerably in its popularity by the fact that it brings together, for the first time, Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert."
512,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"[The characters] are, indeed, so pleasant and human that one feels a positive regret that it is impossible to shake hands with celluloid figures."
513,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"A director can be gauged by his handling of players, and if Frank Capra still needed to be recommended to our consideration his direction of stars in his latest film would do so."
514,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"Frank Capra, who directed, has turned out a more than workmanlike job. The production is charming, cheerful and clever. The action may be slight and there are no big dramatic sequences, but the story moves along quickly and adroitly."

526,it_happened_one_night,audience,4.0,n,A solid noir romance. The performances are both outstanding and the ending is very satisfying.
527,it_happened_one_night,audience,5.0,n,"It Happened One Night is amazing, a classic that has aged but remains very current, Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert deliver both comedic and well-crafted performances."
528,it_happened_one_night,audience,5.0,n,"This may be but a wish-fulfillment farce, but well-crafted all the same. It is never dull, and the story keeps you off-balance so the viewer never can really be sure how things will turn out.

A spoiled daughter of a very rich father, tiring of his gilded cage, finally runs off to elope with a daredevil aviator, who is in New York. The father hires a slew of detectives to locate her, but she manages to get on a bus with a reporter who has heard about her situation and wants a big story to boost his career. With that purpose, he helps the daughter on her way to New York, but plenty of things go wrong along the way. And to make matters worse, the father decides to allow the marriage to take place-but complications ensue from that.

Great character interaction and acting not only between the two leads, but between each of them as well as side characters make the story exciting, and the atmosphere of a dull, irritating bus ride and later running through the countryside is perfectly conveyed. Arguably one of the greatest of Frank Capra's movies."
529,it_happened_one_night,audience,4.0,n,"Reviewed 7.26.21  To see this movie for the first time is to have it hit you: all romantic comedies started here.  Sure, Buster Keaton & Charlie Chaplin brilliantly touched on the genre via silent films in the 1920's.  But it wasn't until Robert Risken put pen to paper that this now ubiquitous genre was created.  If not for the cringeworthy way men communicated with women 'way back when,' the flow of the dialogue could have been lifted from a modern rom-com. 
 
It'll seem quaint to today's moviegoer.  Just to think that Claudette Colbert demanded a 'leg stunt double' be called in for the classic hitchhiking scene, before quipping ""that's not my leg,"" and relenting.  The film was pre-code too, but nonetheless, the prudish surface of things pervades.  It's all the funnier for it.  

Add Clark Gable at his still youthful and quirky best, and there's charm to spare.  Without context, one might dismiss it as simple, even frivolous (as many still do today when critiquing the genre).  But alas, it was revolutionary, becoming the first film to win all five major Academy awards. 
 
Sure it has blemishes, the flow is broken at times by odd sing-alongs and quirky asides, but that's kind of the beauty of it.  Romantic comedies still aren't considered high art, so it's the perfect blueprint for the genre it created.  Alone in a vacuum, it's a 3 star movie.  But as it sinks in that you're watching a must-see piece of film history, and a true first, it's 4 stars all the way."
530,it_happened_one_night,audience,3.5,n,"This type of movie is not normally my cup of tea.  Watching it with no context, it is a rather dated lightweight rom com that managed to win best picture at the 1934 Oscars, though few of the best picture winners from the era have aged well.  My opinion of the film improved actually by watching the special features (the main reason I bother with DVDs anymore), particularly the commentary from Frank Capra Jr.  He tells a story of a picture that was not considered to be much of anything by its lead actress, who insisted she had to go on vacation in four weeks and the film simply had to be done in that timeframe.  The result of this hectic and frenetic shooting schedule was a film that FEELS frenetic in terms of its pacing, and it took someone pointing this out to me to see what an amazing, seat-of-your-pants thing it was that the film got made at all, let alone to the great acclaim it received from audiences and critics.  This certainly deepened my respect for if not my enjoyment of this film.  It's got some really funny sequences and is worth the watch!"
531,it_happened_one_night,audience,4.0,n,"This was an enjoyable watch and the movie was clearly well-crafted, made particularly obvious by how tons of rom-coms have drawn inspiration from it. I had actually never seen Clark Gable in a movie before and found myself surprised at how slight and skinny he seemed. Most of the comedy has withstood the passing of time, though like most rom-coms they don't lean into it heavily enough to make the movie as funny as it could've been. Until this movie I'd been very surprised that I liked all the Capra movies I'd seen as he was a conservative with values that aren't held by anyone but the villains in some of his movies; this one was the first I'd seen where Robert Riskin was the screenwriter and it made much more sense after that as Robert (a  big liberal) apparently wrote Frank's earliest successes and Frank repeated them later. Of particular note to me was how much better this movie was than the Best Picture winner from the year prior as that was one of my least-favorite movies of all time; this one being extremely good cements my opinion that Cavalcade just sucked and that it wasn't representative of this era of movies. Woohoo!"
532,it_happened_one_night,audience,5.0,n,"I felt like I was watching the mother of the films. This movie has been so influential to cinema is impossible to not like it. Is so full of details and charming performances, comedy and chemistry between its actors. Definetly, a story that remains in the heart."

539,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,Haynes jettisons the traditional role of talking heads; he dispatches incidental music; he regards emotional arcs and sentimentality the way he might a toothache. He made a film that feels of a kind with the subject.

576,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,5.0,n,"Excellent documentary for Velvet Underground fans.   It discusses the band members fairly equally with a focus on what their motivations were, how they worked together, inspirations and their backgrounds.   Includes a good deal about Nico as well.  Great clips of Warhol and some of his art films, too. It will re-spark interest in their music if you hadn’t heard them in awhile. It almost  “takes you there” to the time period and captures it’s energy."
577,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,4.5,n,A pretty good documentary about one of my favorite bands and a favorite artist.
578,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,4.0,n,"Better than expected - it has a narrative but a little overlong, especially at the beginning. Lots about Lou as you might expect but little from him. He was difficult to interview l guess. Glad Mo Tucker got a shout out for After Hours. That deserved to be a big record, best flat singing ever (eat your heart out Morrissey). John Cale looks miles better now than in the day when he would walked it into Slytherin. Not sure how a non fan would like this. Nor am l really sure what the legacy is. Definitely Bowie. Moontans, skinny tight everything black and shades?"
579,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,3.5,n,"Highly recommended for anyone interested in the Velvets or the 1960s avant garde art/music scene, but might be a bit boring for others. Interesting/artsy use of video clips. Lots of old video/audio clips that have probably never been seen/heard by most viewers."
580,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,2.5,p,"The director of this documentary is obviously a huge fan of the late 60s avant garde movement in New York. While it was interesting to see what brought the band together, a little more time could have been spent on their later work. Most of the movie seemed more centred on Andy Warhol and his ilk, instead of the genius that Lou Reed and company brought to the table. Most of the focus is on the first two albums, then it seems like "" Oh then they made a couple of more successful albums and Lou Reed walked away. The end."""
581,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,5.0,n,"It gives a new whole perspective about the importance of The Velvet Underground. In addition to incredible unpublished footage, the film contextualizes the band's emergence within an effervescent avant-garde scene of the 50s and 60s in music (John Cale disciple of John Cage and La Monte Young), literature (Lou Reed linked to Allen Ginsberg and Delmore Schwartz ), visual arts (Warhol, etc.) and cinema (Jonas Mekas)."
582,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,3.5,n,"The Velvet Underground is a pretty unique documentary. I didn’t know anything about the band going into this. The main reason I watched this is because I’m a big fan of Todd Haynes as a director. I was very curious to see what he’d bring to the documentary genre. I learned that the titular band was very experimental, and Haynes’ approach to the material fits that description. I loved the use of split screen, and the editing of the images worked very well. The film was at its best when it wasn’t afraid to diverge from what you typically see in a music documentary. Unfortunately, there were times where the film leaned into those cliches, with the typical talking heads structure and moving from album to album. I feel like this could’ve been amazing if it stuck to the weird montage style the entire time. Still, it’s a pretty interesting watch. Overall, I liked this. It packs a lot of information in 2 hours, and it’s definitely not a fast paced watch. But Haynes’ direction and the band themselves make it a worthwhile watch. If you love the band you’re probably watching regardless of what I say. But if you’re on the fence I say give it a watch if you like things that are more on the experimental side."

585,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"We are our own demons. This is Boseman's last film and probably his best acting, combining rage and passion. The movie presents its characters through dialogue, and uses its music for catharsis and tension instead of pleasure. [Full review in Spanish]"
586,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"This film should be an essential addition in any filmmaker course, for what it does right and where it failed-Viola Davis in a fat suit."
587,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"A touching final performance from Chadwick Boseman wonderfully rounds out this sweaty, robust drama of music and indignation."
588,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"A film that rides on the coat-tails of its magnificent leads. Davis and Boseman give two of the finest performances on screen this past year, but it's a slow-burn and definitely lacks universal appeal."
589,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"While it's sad that this is the last performance of one of the best actors of the last decade, it's also obvious as hell that Chadwick Boseman, as with everything he ever did, gave it his all."

591,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is an example of what happens when a director and cast have intimate knowledge of the material, making it as great as it can be."
592,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"Not coincidentally, the abject absence of a benign, just deity runs through Tony Award-winning director George C. Wolfe's sublime adaptation of Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, August Wilson's 1984 Pulitzer Prize-winning play."
593,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,rotten,n,"[The film] feels respectful yet bloodless, unwilling to risk much in cinematic transposition, and thus putting all of the responsibility on the performers to provide the juice."

595,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,A beautiful piece of film that captures the root of theater and the very gut of Blues.
596,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,rotten,n,"On stage, Wilson's work retains an operatic force - it's big, and expressionistic and impactful. But on screen, everything feels small in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom .It's dutiful and earnest but it's never lively and rarely natural."
597,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"A Black story for a Black ensemble, well-made and true to the material."
598,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"Boseman's last performance is a marvel of enthusiasm and detailed invention, with Levee's final outburst the polar opposite of this actor's generosity."
599,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,...a somewhat stagy yet mostly captivating drama...
600,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"It not only illustrates a biographical fragment of Ma Rainey's short career and a tribute to the jazz era, but also uses her image to dialogue behind closed doors with relevant topics about racism, injustice and segregation. [Full review in Spanish]"
601,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"Boseman is a marvel from his high-spirited intro, shoes first, to his shockingly vulnerable confession monologue, to his rage against both the white man and God, and on through to his inevitable exhausted defeat."
602,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"For a film named after a groundbreaking blues icon, Ma Rainey frustratingly gets very little screen time."
603,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,The sense that we're beholden to the whims of unseen forces-that we're not the protagonists of our own stories-cuts deep in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.

605,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"The story concerns itself chiefly with the role of music in documenting and, in some cases, defusing the unspeakable pains that birthed the blues."
606,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,Acting doesn't come much bolder and more blistering than in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.
607,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"Each of the actors rises to the occasion in this production, riding a wave of heat crafted by screenwriter and Wilson whisperer Ruben Santiago-Hudson."
608,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"The downside to the film's almost musical rhythm is that it never quite transcends its stagey feel... On the other hand, it's hard to argue against the power of seeing Boseman or Davis' faces fill the screen."
609,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is pure art, just as beautiful as it is heartbreaking."
610,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,rotten,n,"Ma Rainey has the weight of Hollywood power players behind it, but it seems incapable or uninterested in taking advantage of the delights of what film can do."
611,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"You never forget that you're watching a play on film, but that's okay because the dialogue snaps and leaps -- it's so intense and so exquisite, and yet the emotion beneath it is real."
612,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"It has the sensibility of an Ernie Barnes painting throughout, capturing the many different hues of Black people... And then of course, there is the music, which is extraordinary. Good work all the way around."
613,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,Levee is a force that pummels through the film... Davis burns through the pageantry.
614,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"Like Ma demanded in her time, Davis claims every scene in which she's centered without dimming the performances of her co-stars. As if that were possible."
615,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"Two searing performances-by Viola Davis and the late Chadwick Boseman-make this filmmore than just a faithful adaptation of a great theater piece and preserves one of August Wilson's enduring works for all time, enacted by a dream cast."
616,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"Chadwick Boseman gives a powerful performance that reverberates with pride, pain and thwarted ambition."
617,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,The film occasionally suffers from the slight stiffness that often afflicts movies adapted from theater. But to watch these actors is pure pleasure...
618,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is a small film with big ideas, bigger speeches, and two towering performances."
619,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"August Wilson's tale of what it means to be a Black artist in a racist society is hardly new, but the telling of that tale has never been more artful or more urgently performed than it is in this incarnation of ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom."""

622,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,Boseman plays Levee with an electricity that feels urgent.
623,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"If the drama is galvanizing enough, that's all you need. And what we have here is more than enough: Viola Davis in one of her greatest performances, and the late Chadwick Boseman in his final and most powerful appearance."
624,ma_raineys_black_bottom,audience,3.5,n,The ensemble are a force and keep you engaged from beginning to end.
625,ma_raineys_black_bottom,audience,2.5,p,There's nothing happening here
626,ma_raineys_black_bottom,audience,3.5,n,"I cannot deny that both Chadwick and Viola Davis deliver excellent performances that's both thought provoking and tragic. My problem with this movie is that it feels like a stage play and not a cinematic masterpiece. Don't get me wrong, the costuming and make-up is great, but the fact that the entire movie takes place in a very contained space, and that the actors deliver several long monologues throughout the movie, make it feel very unnatural. Still, the acting is brilliant and I would probably not have seen the play so I am happy I saw the movie."
627,ma_raineys_black_bottom,audience,3.0,n,"Forget the botched Oscars, Chadwick Boseman's performance is great in this and it shows his full range, filled with charisma. Viola Davis is also a powerhouse, and the two of them carry this otherwise fairly typical film to greater heights. Films set in this era should trigger some emotion, especially given the moment, and in that regard, it hits all the right notes."
628,ma_raineys_black_bottom,audience,5.0,n,"A classic with the late Chadwick Bozeman and Great Viola Davis complementing the performance of each other, not excluding the above excellent performances from Glynn Truman, Colman Domingo and Michael Potts………👌🏽"
629,ma_raineys_black_bottom,audience,3.5,n,"I wasn't expecting a ""bottle episode"" kind of movie. Strong performances from the two leads, and by the end of it it's pretty clear that was taken from a play even if, like me, you didn't know that at the beginning."
630,ma_raineys_black_bottom,audience,4.0,n,"n just a bit over 90 minutes of runtime, we witness powerhouse performances, listen to a well-crafted screenplay, and contain more knowledge of Black culture while also seeing the social injustices and racism that unfortunately, is still at large in today's time. 

What must be recognized first is Ruben Santiago-Hudson talent in writing. Every minute of dialogue, especially in the band room scenes, becomes better and better as the minutes flow by, evoking a different emotion each time.

She received an Oscar once and may she receive it again, Viola Davis brings Ma to life, blowing you away every minute she's on screen. Alongside Ma, here comes Levee. A special soul gone too soon, this is Chadwick Boseman's best and it is a true heartbreak we won't be experiencing his talent anymore. 


Like I stated before, here comes Levee. Levee is a character that sticks to our minds. A man who is not afraid of the white man but sadly cannot escape the white man. We see this in several aspects such as the story of his mother, the finally-broken door which leads to nowhere, and the tragic incident with Toledo. 

On the lines of Levee, let's touch on jelly roll. Learning the ending was not in August Wilson's play, it establishes itself as a significant and important addition. The group of white men singing Levee's song that Sturdivant bought when he shoved $5 into Levee's shirt pocket like he was doing him a favor, is the symbol of Black musicians and artists' works being seized by white artists. There is still not much credit or truth to where certain music originated from. 

If you have read this far and have not jumped on the Ma train, do it as soon as possible."
631,ma_raineys_black_bottom,audience,2.5,p,"Anchored by two excellent central performances from the late Chadwick Boseman and Viola Davis, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, unfortunately, doesn't quite sell itself as a film. Based on a stage play, the film suffers from its own origins, and doesn't fully work in film format, in the way that another film on this list does. Still, the performances are superb, and Boseman, in one of his last screen roles is not to be bet against for a posthumous Oscar. It's a film that also suffers from its own claustrophobia, although the film takes place in just a few rooms, which is fine, it's a relief on the couple of occasions the camera does venture outside, and you can almost taste the fresh air. That's both a compliment and a criticism, it's a testament to the performances that I felt this way, but I wished it was a little less stagey. It's worth a watch though, and it's available on Netflix."
632,ma_raineys_black_bottom,audience,4.5,n,"I’m not familiar with the stage production, but that feel is retained in this excellent film. Solid performances all around and good cinematography."
633,ma_raineys_black_bottom,audience,4.0,n,"Sin duda, esta historia tiene un guion super original. Donde no se enfocan en contar una sola historia. Sin no un conjunto de ellas que al principio parece que no tienen nada que ver entre si, y conforme avanza la historias todas las mini historias se unen entre si para darle cara a la historia principal de la película. Otra cosa que resalta de la película es su increíble fotografía y vestuario. Cada momento de la historia se puede apreciar su detalle y cuidado de estos dos elementos. Tanto que en la fotografía a pesar de que casi toda la película prácticamente se desarrolle en un set, la importancia de esta hace que el escenario parezca que se une a los sentimientos de los personajes. Una película super recomendable."
634,ma_raineys_black_bottom,audience,5.0,n,"Whew. The overwhelming sense of being trapped as a black person, disregarded and disrespected leading to despair. Outstanding screenplay, acting, directing and music. The last scene appropriately made us white folks seem small and lame."

646,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,"This film is provocative for the strength of the script and its topics, not so much for how it was conducted."
647,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,A rousing testament to those among us who seek to find meaning in even the worst moments of our lives.
648,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,"In the hands of a lesser writer, this story could easily slipped into a divisive screed about the politics of gun control. Instead, writer-director Kranz steers the plot into a more universal story about sorrow, anger, and the search for answers."

650,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,In a magnificently human way shows us how to have a meaningful dialogue about a current American crisis that's dividing the country.

654,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Kranz rightfully submerges us in this cinematic powder keg for about 110 minutes, which is just the perfect amount of time to spend with these four people."
655,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,"'Mass' is a remarkable study of grief and acceptance that's both timely and important. It showcases four of the best performances of the year, and it challenges your own thoughts and feelings."
656,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,"The performances are too internalized to seem theatrical. Often, ""Mass"" is most moving when they're simply listening."

660,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,"At its core, ""Mass"" exerts the power of ritual at its most reflective and galvanizing, reveling in human connection at its most arduous, persistent and sublime."
661,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Thoughtful and harrowing, Mass is a difficult wonder."
662,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Some horrors must be faced. ""Mass"" faces them head-on, and is all the better for it."
663,mass_2021,critics,rotten,n,"Kranz can't quite figure out a way to make his characters' collective misery cinematically interesting. This is a serious movie, but not a searing one."
664,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,Mass's unusual approach -- to consider how people communicate with one another -- results in the rare dramatization of a school shooting's lasting effects that feels truthful without being exploitative.

676,mass_2021,audience,4.5,n,"Rating: A

""Mass is undoubtedly one of the most emotionally challenging viewings I've ever had to face. Fran Kranz's feature directorial debut tells an unbelievably heavy story through four actors who dive deep into their characters, all delivering career-best performances. Everyone is an incredible standout: Jason Isaacs, Ann Dowd, Martha Plimpton, and Reed Birney deserve a massive campaign to receive every acting award there is. The cast drains every single ounce of emotion within the viewers, transforming a tiny little room with impactful mise-en-scène that tells its own story into an extremely tense, heart-wrenching, almost unbreathable environment. Dozens of meaningful matters and challenging feelings are addressed in the span of little less than two hours, creating a truly devastating film that left me sobbing. It's utterly impossible for someone not to be affected by this movie, even if it's in a negative way. It's one of those films that I'll recommend to everyone and support throughout its eventual release, but I can't deny this might have been my one and only watch of such a brutally demanding, authentic story."""
677,mass_2021,audience,4.5,n,"Somewhere between In The Bedroom and We Need To Talk About Kevin, this is the best chamber piece written for the big screen in a long time. Fran Kranz delivers one of the very best screenplays of the year and the quartet of performances is nothing short of extraordinary. Heartbreaking, magnetic, unforgettable."
678,mass_2021,audience,5.0,n,"On the eve of yet another school shooting, Mass is the perfect movie to dispense with the theatrics of extremist politics, and really dive in to the after effects of trauma of what these moments are like for the people who are left.. Raw, unflinching, and emotional.  Mass will reach the part of you that knows this has gone on for far too long."
679,mass_2021,audience,4.5,n,"Fran Kranz, previously known mainly as an actor, tells an original story in his directorial debut Mass, which could seem like an adapted play to many. Six years after a devastating tragedy, the parents of two victims gather in the room of a church to come to terms with the events of that time together. This results in a real emotional chaos between four protagonists, peppered with grief, pain, anger and pure fear.

I have often heard that Mass is a quiet film. Yes, it's not a sci-fi blockbuster with countless scenarios, dispenses entirely with any effects and has only four central characters. In that respect, it is definitely a quiet film. But if you define calm by emotional connection, then Mass is probably the spectacle of the year. For what is rehashed and thematised here rips your heart out. Rarely have I shed so many tears at a film. Rarely have all the protagonists grown so close to my heart despite their different behaviours. Never have dialogues and monologues been so close to my heart. This is largely due to Franz's borderline brilliant screenplay. But in this film it is the actors who make the difference. I have rarely come across such a top-class performance from an ensemble. All four get moments to shine and do so with incredible bravura. I'll start with Jason Isaacs, probably the most recognisable name among the four. His character Jay still can't believe the incident and death of his son. He tries to understand the psyche of the perpetrator, who turns out to be the son of the other parents. Although he tries not to ask too much of them at first, he becomes more and more impatient and angry as time goes on. This leads to a scene where Jay snaps and takes the conversation in a completely different direction. From this point on he is an emotional wreck. You buy both emotional states from Isaacs through his facial expressions alone. Best Supporting Actor 2022: Jason Isaacs, Mass. Let's move on to the two mothers, Gale (Martha Plimpton) and Linda (Ann Dowd). The former is unexpectedly restrained until the last act, before letting her baggage run free at the end. And in a way that is simply unfathomable. Plimpton's chemistry with Isaacs is insanely authentic and if you said they'd been through this thing in real life, I'd believe it. Ann Dowd is much more eloquent in her role and always tries to be the emotional constant through subtlety. Until a final monologue that must win Dowd the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Even though she and Plimpton give each other nothing here. If only there were Reed Birney as the no-nonsense and proud businessman Richard. He talks a lot but never really gets too specific. He is emotionally stiff. Although he visibly wants to open up more, he can't. This is frustrating to watch, but also couldn't be better portrayed. Birney also deserves all the praise in the world for his less emotional but efficient performance.

So yes, Mass is an acting masterpiece. One that I have rarely seen in this form and one that will stay with me for a very long time. It tells a tragic story in such a realistic manner that you almost believe you are really standing in the room listening to the four people on the spot. Dialogue has rarely been so tangible and distant for someone who, thank God, has never had to go through something like this. But at the same time, it's a film I probably won't be able to watch again because of the sheer harshness of its subject matter. Moreover, certain visual cuts are unnecessary. But no one cares about that."
680,mass_2021,audience,4.0,n,Very intense and heavy film. Acting was stellar across the board!
681,mass_2021,audience,5.0,n,Powerful performances by everyone! Such an important movie. I wasn’t interested at first in seeing it but then read an article in our local paper and decided to give it a try. Both my husband thought it was excellent! Heartbreaking at times but such a beautiful story of both sides.
682,mass_2021,audience,3.5,n,Thought provoking if a bit dull at times
683,mass_2021,audience,5.0,n,Felt drawn in from the moment the movie started you are fully invested in the emotions of the characters throughout the entire movie and felt that the cinematography was beautiful for the fact that they are in 1 room the entire time. Most likely my favorite movie for the year so far & for a long time
684,mass_2021,audience,4.5,n,The screenplay never goes to the places you might think like how they introduce a stereotypical gun rights debate only to promptly dismiss it and then focuses instead on trickier emotional issues. The performances here are truly sublime.
685,mass_2021,audience,5.0,n,"Wow- most powerful film I've seen in AGES.  Where has Martha Plimpton BEEN…..?  Can someone please say Oscar nod ??
Heart-wrenching and finely acted.  Anne Dowd and Jason Isaacs give wonderful performances. I hope many people see this - it's worth it."
686,mass_2021,audience,5.0,n,"Brilliant, moving with extraordinary acting.  I hope people seek it out even given the terribly sad subject matter."
687,mass_2021,audience,5.0,n,Extremely compelling premise and dialogue
688,mass_2021,audience,5.0,n,Extraordinarily heartbreaking story expertly told and acted. The acting and writing were a tour de force.  Absolutely riveting - Oscar worth performances. Will stay with you well after you leave the theater.
689,mass_2021,audience,4.0,n,"The movie doesn't have anything new to say about the American gun epidemic, but competently shows the emotional impact in the ones involved. Four of the best performances you'll see this year."
690,mass_2021,audience,5.0,n,"A breathtaking directorial debut by Fran Kranz a moving film that unflinchingy addresses love, loss, forgiveness and heartbreak. The performances by all four leads are extraordinary. This film is essential viewing for all since we all will come to terms with grief, love, loss and forgiveness."
691,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,But the bigger problem with the film is that it suffers from the girlboss-ification of female characters that has seeped into media over the few years.
692,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,A fabulous director and two awesome stars battle their way through a wonky script.
693,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,"While it improves in the second half, Black Widow is too uneven and generic to recommend. Telling a story about freewill and liberation is ironically littered with too many artistic compromises."
694,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Fun, funny, and frenetic without being overwhelming. [Full Review in Spanish]"
695,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Johansson is good, better than she's been given the opportunity to be before with this role, but she - like Black Widow is still stunted in many ways by the vision the MCU has for Natasha which makes this feel more elegiac than energetic."
696,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Marvel finally releases the Black Widow origin story, but how many more years before we see another one?"
697,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Natasha deserved a better memorial.
698,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Bland spy hooey. Although Pugh is a standout.
699,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Black Widow is worth seeing for Florence Pugh, the free-fall action sequence, and anything involving Taskmaster before it's revealed who is under the mask. The film mostly feels like it was done better by the films it was supposedly influenced by."
700,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,The rawness made for a spirited episode that every Marvel fan needs to listen to.
701,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"It would've been amazing to receive this movie 4 years ago, now it's just too late. That doesn't mean it's not a worthy closure for a much beloved character. [Full review in Spanish]"
702,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,The positives do outweigh the negatives but it does frustratingly end up feeling middle-of-the-road in terms of the MCU output.
703,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Black Widow is not as tedious and self-serious an entry as some of them. But that is setting the bar low.
704,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,What ensues is a film that isn't interested in planting seeds for future Marvel movies -- which is actually a refreshing change of pace.
705,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Pugh is the only victory for this vanilla Marvel movie. [...] Fans are left wondering what could have been. And Johansson is left fighting a lawsuit against the world's biggest entertainment behemoth - a mission that seems too much even for Natasha.
706,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Black Widow achieves the unthinkable and dethrones Thor: The Dark World as the worst film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
707,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,"The spotlight should firmly be on her, or so you would have thought, but for all its acrobatic female kick-ass baddery poor old Natasha Romanoff has to share that limelight with her highly skilled ""family"" to bring down the patriarchy."
708,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Almost completely lacking in Black Widow is any sense of outrage over the grotesque violations of human rights and human dignity at the root of the whole premise of the film.
709,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,"The problem with Black Widow is that the whole ordeal feels like an obligatory afterthought, simply going through the motions with only a perfunctory sense of charm."
710,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Black Widow has everything going on: dysfunctional families, sibling rivalry, a fatuous Russian superhero, a cackling Bond villain and an army of female assassins. What more do you want?"
711,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,What ensues is a film that isn't interested in planting seeds for future Marvel movies -- which is actually a refreshing change of pace.
712,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Almost completely lacking in Black Widow is any sense of outrage over the grotesque violations of human rights and human dignity at the root of the whole premise of the film.
713,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"While humour is an important part of the film, it's used to serve the tragic story rather than undercut it."
714,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,"Black Widow represents the MCU looking back when it should be moving forward. Everything about the movie seems small, even the big action set-pieces"
715,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,"More women is its only decent idea. Otherwise, it's business as usual. Otherwise, it's all formulaic bish-bosh, smash-crash action scenes broken up by lame jokes and lame philosophising along the lines of: ""Your pain only makes you stronger."""
716,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Shortland does a solid job with the material, but even she isn't able to entirely gloss over how Natasha randomly keeps disappearing in her own movie or how what is supposed to be her story frequently focuses on other characters."
717,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,I appreciate the way that Cate Shortland adapts herself well to an action film... This is one of the individual [Marvel Cinematic Universe] films that I would keep.
718,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,It suggests to me that there was never a real grasp on what this film was supposed to be.
719,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Director Cate Shortland has a sharp eye for directing action sequences, but the script is flawed."
720,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,"To ensure that all of our behemoth pop culture franchises become one indistinguishable mass of content, the MCU is now faster and furious-er..."
721,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"In all the ways that matter to an MCU fan, Black Widow the film meets or exceeds all expectations. It is a killer action flick, and a unique viewing experience... in that I loved it, and the fact that I loved it also makes me livid."
722,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Pursuit of the nameless something just out of reach is the motor that keeps Black Widow whirring. If nothing else, it puts the self-serious quest for a dumb jeweled glove in perspective."
723,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,"""Black Widow"" never feels more than just a footnote in the story, a detour that holds no weight in the larger M.C.U. narrative, except to set up Yelena for a larger role in the future."
724,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"The film put flesh on the bones of the character in a way that hadn't been done before. I enjoyed it and I wasn't bored, though I was baffled by the accents."
725,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,"It's a strange movie: front-loaded with its best action, its zippiest writing, its canniest pleasures, then derailed by exposition that only serves to let the air out of the room for being so obvious rather than deepening what's there."
726,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,"The film ceases to be about Natasha wrestling with her heroism; by pitting her against a raging misogynist, Black Widow tries to simplistically cast Natasha as a pop-feminist icon."
727,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,Black Widow gives Marvel's superspy the callback-filled swan song that she and the loyal audience deserve.
728,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,"Coming out more than a year after it was supposed to, it feels like an awkward reminder of what Marvel failed to do early on in its run, but occasionally, mostly whenever Pugh is in control, it's a thrilling preview of what's to come."
729,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"We waited two years for this. And it's so worth it. Yeah, it's good."
730,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,"Johansson and co-star Florence Pugh are terrific, but the lightweight story relies on implausible plot turns and cheap soap opera antics."
731,black_widow_2021,audience,1.0,p,Boring and irrelevant story. Attempts at Russian accents were distracting throughout. Relying too much on a VFX heavy ending to the point where it was too much / action was too unbelievable at the end even for a film like this.
732,black_widow_2021,audience,5.0,n,o que mas me convenceu foi a trajetória na viúva Negra. a o gancho de ramificações para novo heróis. foi incrível.
733,black_widow_2021,audience,1.5,p,"The most generic, predictable and boring movie I've seen from the MCU in a long time, something very forgettable that is sustained in the pure participation of its actors, in that case I would have paid for a family sitcom with Scarlet Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbor and Rachel Weisz."
734,black_widow_2021,audience,3.5,n,"Pretty good, the younger sister does a great job.  The movie is full of light-hearted family dynamics that are funny.  Scarlet did a great job the problem was with Task Master.  Couple that with the flying or falling for like 30 mins really.  Step it up Marvel."
735,black_widow_2021,audience,4.0,n,"A long overdue, fantastic solo movie. Taskmaster was a bit of a missed opportunity, and the film can get slightly too ambitious at times. Neither of these complaints detract much from what is a very solid, satisfying examination of Natasha's past."
736,black_widow_2021,audience,1.5,p,"Uninteresting story, badly told, decently acted and horrendously edited"
737,black_widow_2021,audience,3.0,n,"Nothing new or inventive, but not every Marvel movie gets to be great. Some just need to check the boxes and fill out the time in between Spider-Man movies."
738,black_widow_2021,audience,2.5,p,"This movie came more than a decade too late. Also this is not a Black Widow movie, it's a movie to set up her replacement in the MCU.
Another predictable marvel movie that does nothing to push the envelope where the stars have plot armor and according to the laws of physic and basic biology should have died more than once. And that has some mindboggling weird plot choices. 
The acting was great but the only thing that kept me watching was Florence Pugh great and both emotional and funny performance."
739,black_widow_2021,audience,3.5,n,"This feels like a phase one movie - It's not bad at all, but that title sequence showed me that with a higher age rating it could have been one of the most interesting MCU movies, which does make the end product sting a little.
As it is - it's a decent MCU movie. The chemistry between the cast was great, the action was pretty good."
740,black_widow_2021,audience,3.5,n,Great action movie with many funny lines.
741,black_widow_2021,audience,2.0,p,I took my wife and kids and we will not re-watch this movie. We were bored.
742,black_widow_2021,audience,3.0,n,"If they never made this movie, we would've been okay.  It didn't have a great story and seemed like they forced the funny scenes."
743,black_widow_2021,audience,4.5,n,"Revisiting Black Widow within The MCU is a treat, exploring her super spy past with a nice mix of the signature Marvel flavoring of action, humor, and sentimentality, within a backdrop of Russian Espionage."
744,black_widow_2021,audience,3.5,n,"Black Widow is a fun action movie. It was great to see a majority female cast kick butt in the movie. Unfortunately, this movie isn't much different than other Marvel movies. I also felt like the writers completely missed the mark on what fans expect to see from such a fan-favorite villain in Taskmaster."
745,black_widow_2021,audience,5.0,n,"Solid Marvel movie, but more depressing back story than usual."
746,black_widow_2021,audience,3.5,n,"Lots of action with wry humor mixed in. Good for backstory, you gain a better understanding of her character. Obviously a large part of this movie was to introduce her adopted sister for the Hawkeye series."
747,black_widow_2021,audience,5.0,n,Anothet great film from Marvel! Cannot wait to see how these new characters will fit into the coming Marvel Universe. Great action and the humor was unexpected and hilarious.
748,black_widow_2021,audience,5.0,n,Loved this movie. Great action and I am excited to see what happens in the next MCU movie.
749,black_widow_2021,audience,5.0,n,Tons of action and a nice plot to fill the gap between Civil War and Infinity War.
750,black_widow_2021,audience,5.0,n,It was action packed and seeing Scarlett in another lead role was great!  There was a nice story line to this - which sometimes Marvel movies lack.
751,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,Third time is equally charming for Woody and the gang.
752,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,Nothing short of brilliant.
753,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,Yet another masterful creation by Pixar Animation Studios.
754,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,Not in the same league as Pixar's previous efforts ... it still solidifies the notion that this production company is at the forefront of modern animation.
755,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"Toy Story 3 is not only one of Pixar's best films, but perhaps the best of the Toy Story trilogy."
756,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,...an inventive and often completely gripping adventure...
757,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"While threepeats may be rare in the sports world, they're even harder to achieve in the cinematic realm. Yet here's Toy Story 3, bucking the odds and satisfying sky-high expectations."
758,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"Something deeply, almost primal in a powerful way, tapping into the emotional core of an entire generation and the eternally young at heart."
759,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"More than lives up to the lofty expectations as a worthy addition to the already classic series. There is something for everyone in the film, which is easily the best major American studio release I've seen in 2010."
760,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,Toy Story 3 has magic in spades.
761,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"Dear Pixar, THANK YOU for not churning out yet another inferior straight-to-DVD animated sequel, and instead taking the time to create something that will be as dear to Toy Story fans at the first time we saw Woody & Buzz on screen."
762,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"From moments of pure delight to one of the most heartbreaking goodbyes in recent movie memory, the trilogy wraps up in a masterful way and once again proves Pixar is on a level all its own."
763,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"Leave it to Pixar to subvert the Hollywood rule of sequels, which states that each subsequent film must have eyes full of dollar signs at the expense of quality."
764,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"With a heart felt ending and truly outstanding story, Toy Story 3 has ensured that the franchise and all the characters we have known and loved, will be remembered for infinity, and beyond."
765,toy_story_3,critics,rotten,n,"What's so distressing about all this, as I keep pointing out, is the tremendous talent of the Pixar team getting wasted on nostalgic goop, forever presenting idealized 1950s suburban culture as the norm."
766,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,Moments of uproarious humor and emotional farewells offset the darkness and send Woody and his pals on a memorable ride off into the sunset.
767,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"Like last year's Up from the same company, Pixar, this film tickles the funny bone but also brings a tear to the eye."
768,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"Hilarity, terrors, the melancholy of love and loss and growing up, and millions of adult-baby tears ensue."
769,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"It's not the usual Hollywood conveyor-belt product. Made with love and intelligence, this adventure has enough thrills, laughs and emotion to satisfy any adult or child."
770,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,A reasonable amount of fun ensues.
771,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,The ostensibly inanimate objects are far more animated than most movie stars.
772,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"It takes a kind of genius to combine a children's movie for grown-ups and a grown-up's movie for children in one glittering digimated package, yet the folks at Pixar have done it time and again."
773,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"Action-wise, this is essentially a prison-break caper, but there is so much more to it than this."
774,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"When teenaged Andy plops down on the grass to share his old toys with a shy little girl, the film spikes with sadness and layered pleasure -- a concise, deeply wise expression of the ephemeral that feels real and yet utterly transporting."
775,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"There are many sweet laughs and joking allusions to horror and prison-break movies, but the Pixar gang gets at the most primary fear -- being cast off and no longer of use."
776,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,I seriously doubt there will be a more hilarious and heartfelt blockbuster all summer.
777,toy_story_3,critics,rotten,n,"You can intellectualise and even defend the reasons why the film is disappointing, but that doesn't stop it being disappointing."
778,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"It's still more inventive, clever and laugh-out-loud funny than any other movie out there now."
779,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"A kids' movie for grown-ups. A grown-up movie for kids. Exactly what you'd expect -- and hope for -- from the latest, and we're guessing final, Woody and Buzz adventure."
780,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"Comes across at once as a tender, thoughtful valedictory and a symbolic renewal."
781,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"By [Pixar's] high standards this isn't the best, but by anyone else's, it's close to perfection."
782,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,I tried stuffing paper into my nose and into my mouth and in my ears to stop the flow. It was hopeless. Toy Story 3 is not only a masterpiece but is the most heart-rending film I have ever seen.
783,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"The perfect film does not, and cannot, exist. But if it did, it would probably look a lot like this."
784,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,It's an effortlessly superior family movie.
785,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"It's a film that moves as much as it entertains, that will make adults cry as much as -- perhaps even more than -- younger children."
786,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,The 'Toy Story' films are deservedly seen as the gold standard for computer-generated animation...
787,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,If there were a Nobel Prize for Digital Animation it would have been won almost every year by Pixar.
788,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"It's sadder and scarier than its predecessors, but it also may be the most important chapter in the tale."
789,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,The best movie of the year so far.
790,toy_story_3,critics,fresh,p,"The 3D animation is quite beautiful, and there's the usual bonus of a Pixar short film before the feature, the clever and enchanting Night and Day."
791,toy_story_3,audience,5.0,n,Toy Story 3 - in my opinion - is a truly heartwarming and fitting conclusion to the Toy Story franchise.
792,toy_story_3,audience,5.0,n,"Perfect ending, atleast it was the ending until some spork ruined it"
793,toy_story_3,audience,4.0,n,Was pretty good still but can't match Toy Story 1 or 2. Perfect end to what should've been a trilogy
794,toy_story_3,audience,4.5,n,"Blends comedy, adventure, and emotion it is a rare third part that works.  More so than what attracts children, this whole series turned out to be a long, melancholy meditation on loss, impermanence and that little thing called love.  Might be the best of the four movies."
795,toy_story_3,audience,5.0,n,"até hoje, o filme que mais chorei na vida."
796,toy_story_3,audience,5.0,n,"This will always be one of my favorite movies. It manages to be so many things all at the same time, While still being able to be watched by all ages, if you haven't seen this I definitely recommend you do (you will probably be thanking me as soon as it's over)."
797,toy_story_3,audience,4.0,n,"As Andy is preparing for college, his favorite toys accidentally get donated to a daycare instead of being stored in the attic. It is truly amazing that the story tellers at Pixar can continually add a fresh take on these characters with every sequel. All the voice actors do a great job continuing or introducing their characters. Lotso is a well written villain with a sympathetic backstory. The animation is terrific and it is amazing how the look of these characters have changed since the first Pixar movie. The ending will bring tears or warm-fuzzies depending on your mood. Highly recommended movie and a great ending to one of the best trilogies in cinematic history."
798,toy_story_3,audience,5.0,n,A whole fluid drama!
799,toy_story_3,audience,4.0,n,A great 3rd installment of the series with character depth improved...nearly as good as 1
800,toy_story_3,audience,5.0,n,"AMAZING!!! If you don't have the feels in the trash seen, you don't have a heart!"
801,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"[It] showed not only was there audience appetite for a big-budget black superhero flick, but there was appetite for one that grappled with modern societal challenges like isolationism, oppression, and technological disparity."
802,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,There's so much to celebrate about Black Panther.
803,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,It's a cultural phenomenon.
804,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,The best Marvel movie yet.
805,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"A tentpole franchise film that broke the mold of what came before, reveling in a diversity and culture that had barely been touched on in past superhero films and that had certainly not been embraced as widely and emphatically before..."
806,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,Boseman's Black Panther is not only capable of fighting the bad guys but is also a vessel for the film's study of the importance of legacy and identity.
807,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"Sure,Black Panther is a mainstream superhero movie with jaw-dropping action, balletic fight scenes, and CGI spectacle, but it is also a measured and extraordinary exploration of race and pride."
808,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"A taut triumph of Afrofuturist iconography realized in the propulsive, widescreen language of the superhero-blockbuster fantasy, and an elevation of that genre on every front."
809,black_panther_2018,critics,rotten,n,Just about the same as every other Marvel title.
810,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,Here's the thing: you can enjoy Black Panther without having seen a single Marvel film beforehand. It is a stand-alone gem...
811,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"As the new king, T'Challa has to wrestle with a few issues that seem topical in today's society."
812,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,Brilliantly brought to life by the production design by Hannah Beachler and the costume design by Ruth E. Carter.
813,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"You know there must be something special about a superhero movie, an action superhero movie at that, to get my mother to see that movie. And not just once."
814,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,A dream come true! Near Perfection!
815,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,Black Panther is likely Marvel's most politically inspired film to date.
816,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"Believe the hype: This is a superhero flick unlike any we've ever seen, crafted by the unstoppable Ryan Coogler."
817,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"Black Panther not only stands up as a Hollywood blockbuster but conveys an adult and chronological context that touches upon slavery, the Civil Rights movement, Black Lives Matter and the current African-American plight."
818,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,Coogler firmly sports his crown in blurring the lines between the cultural importance Black Panther is set to play in bringing down the dinosaur illusions of Hollywood.
819,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"It's still somewhat overstuffed with an excess of characters and some undeniable hiccups in regards to pacing, but its filmmaking is slick, and the cast oozes charisma."
820,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"Black Panther is not just a superhero flick, it's a meaningful cultural hit that shows the power of diversity to tear down walls. [Full review in Spanish]"
821,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"Each man and woman...is resplendent in Ruth Carter's traditional costumes. Indigenous dialects are spoken amid the space flights, museum heists, and car chases."
822,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"""Black Panther"" lived up to the hype."
823,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,You could feel like everybody felt like they were making something that they were really proud of.
824,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"But Black Panther was a moment, not just for Marvel fans and Disney stans, but it was the rare instance of a film purporting itself to be a cultural movement, and succeeding."
825,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"I want us to love on Black Panther, bravely and openly. But, we cannot forget the asterisk. We cannot forget that a significant achievement for black representation once again came on the back of forced black queer silence."
826,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"Black Panther gives off a contemporary crackle while staying true to its roots, both African and Marvel."
827,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"Black Panther is not just smart and politically aware for a superhero film -- it's smart and politically aware, full stop."
828,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,Black Panther isn't just a great movie for the first half of the year; Black Panther is the best movie Marvel's ever made!
829,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"When it comes to creative visuals, engaging action and likable characters, ""Black Panther"" stands confidently next to the best fare offered up by the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
830,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,Whether or not this is the best film Marvel Studios has made to date-and it is clearly in the discussion-it is by far the most thought-provoking.
831,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"The special effects, sets, costumes, music and production design are bombastic and overpowering at times. Yet, it's also one of the more well-rounded superhero origin films - with a beginning, middle and open end that efficiently sets itself up."
832,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,The identity politics provide a fresh spin to the genre's increasingly tedious narrative formula.
833,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"If it isn't indisputably the best of Marvel's 18 offerings, it is certainly a contender."
834,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"Jordan has swagger to spare, with those rolling shoulders, but there's a breath of charm, too, all the more seductive in the overblown atmosphere of Marvel. He's twice as pantherish as the Panther."
835,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"Coogler is trying for a lot of things in Black Panther, probably too many, but there is also a winning modesty to his ambition."
836,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"I loved spending a couple of hours in the Black Panther's magical, transformative world. Mark me down as someone who wants Wakanda to stay isolated."
837,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"Black Panther is, culturally and commercially, the right film at the right time. The significance of bringing a black superhero to the screen at this moment cannot be overstated. Any reservations I have will, and possibly should, fall by the wayside"
838,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"The real stars of Black Panther are its women, both before and behind the camera."
839,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"Ultimately, it's more interesting to think about than it is to watch."
840,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"Black Panther is a revelation, the first film from the Marvel Cinematic Universe that truly feels like an of-the-moment masterwork that also happens to be a comic book movie."
841,black_panther_2018,audience,4.0,n,Könnte ich jetzt nicht täglich schauen aber ich mag ihn gerne.
842,black_panther_2018,audience,5.0,n,Black Panther is a amazing movie. Visuals and Music of the movie is spectacular. Chadwick Boseman's performance as T'Challa is amazing. Movie shows African Culture to Western and Eastern Audience in a new perspective.
843,black_panther_2018,audience,5.0,n,"Totally awesome, maybe with some fails, but with this movie I hanged out totally with the Black Panther Character, Thank you Chadwick Boseman."
844,black_panther_2018,audience,4.5,n,The best Marvel movie ever made.
845,black_panther_2018,audience,5.0,n,THE SCORE ON THIS MOVIE!!! Incredible. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
846,black_panther_2018,audience,2.0,p,"Un énième Marvel sans grand intérêt remplit de clichés communautaires assez ridicules.La seule chose à garder, ce sont les motivations du méchant qui sont pour le coup intéressantes. 

Mais après, le film manque vraiment d'inspiration pour vraiment être bon. C'est très vite oubliable et même dispensable."
847,black_panther_2018,audience,5.0,n,"this movie was wonderful.  It broadened Marvel's diversity and opens the eyes of the audience to a new point of view, and a new type of superhero, and villain.  The villains rooted in reality motives humanize him, adding even more depth to the already rich storyline and characters. Absolutely must-see."
848,black_panther_2018,audience,3.5,n,A great story for a Marvel movie but felt it relied too heavily on CGI at the end with some not so great choreography. RIP Chadwick...
849,black_panther_2018,audience,5.0,n,"In today's Marvel Cinematic Universe, women and those of color or different ethnicity have come a long way. In 2018, the MCU released a film covering the entirety of African American culture, featuring Chadwick Boseman, an African American male, as the main character. This film discussed revolves around T'Challa and the African nation of Wakanda. This film can be analyzed through the ideas of international relations as the nation of Wakanda transforms from a realist state to a liberalist state."
850,black_panther_2018,audience,3.0,n,Great movie really enjoyed it but not my favorite.
851,black_panther_2018,audience,5.0,n,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!

864,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,"[I] really don't see the point of paying extra for children under eight. Their eyes are still developing, their noses are still small for slippery glasses, and... isn't a trip to the pictures enough for them in any case?"
865,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,"If anything, it improves with age."
866,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,Monsters displays wonderful imagination which makes it worth reliving in an extra dimension - particularly the energetic chase scene along a conveyor belt of doors.

887,monsters_inc,critics,fresh,p,The excellent basic ideas have yielded too few twists and dramatic junctures to keep the picture flying at the level at which it starts.

Una trama que te mantiene pegado al televisor, unos personajes MUY bien desarrollados y profundos, y un universo súper interesante de explorar y que le genera a uno una curiosidad genuina sobre el funcionamiento de la sociedad. Respecto a.... AHHHHHH....¡¡¡UN NIÑO FLOTÓ SOBRE MÍ Y VOLÓ UN AUTO CON SU RASHO LASER!!!"
896,monsters_inc,audience,4.5,n,"The same great mixture of heart, humor, and technical wizardry that made A Bug's Life and Toy Story into instant classics.  It's delightful and should be the textbook definition of adorable.  Like Jim Henson who decided to make his Sesame Street characters monsters so kids would not be afraid of monsters again, the people behind Monsters, Inc. have created monsters that even the shyest child will find unscary.  In fact, kids may decide multiple heads, removable eyes, and hair made from snakes are kind of cute."
897,monsters_inc,audience,4.5,n,Una de las mejores películas de Pixar
898,monsters_inc,audience,5.0,n,"I have never had a monster before, and I truly wish I did so I could understand this film more"
899,monsters_inc,audience,5.0,n,I think that this movie has a amazing story about how you should love some one while you have them before they are gone forever. I also think it is a great Disney movie
900,monsters_inc,audience,4.0,n,"In this Pixar film, two monsters named Mike and Sully must protect a young human girl from an evil plot. In typical Pixar fashion they really up their game in the animation department with each film. In this movie you can see their improvement in the textures, specifically Sully's hair and their snow animation. The story here is great and the relationship between Sully and Boo, the young human girl, is the heart of the film. Randell, the antagonist, is voiced well by Steve Buscemi and is a threatening presence throughout the film. The very last scene of the movie always leaves me with the warm-fuzzies. Highly recommend you check this movie out!"
901,monsters_inc,audience,4.5,n,"For 2001:

PIXAR's fourth animated entry continued to prove the studio's passion for storytelling resonating with audiences 
'Monsters Inc' asks the question what if monsters were actually real and hid in our closets, not only that but actually lived in their own world working for a living?
Actors Billy Crystal and John Goodman play Sully and Mike, two best friends who work at a company called Monsters, Inc that specializes in collecting human children's screams to turn into clean dependable energy 
But the days are getting tougher with kids getting harder to scare and a scare shortage might be on the rise 
Sully is the top scarer competing with rival Randall 
Mike has a girlfriend Celia and the company is run by Mr. Waternoose 
Things change big time when a little human girl named Boo stumbles into the monster world thereby putting Sully and Mike in a bit of a pickle 
Moreover all monsters are lead to believe that a single touch from a human child is toxic 
But Boo bonds with Mike and Sully while at the same time they try to keep her avoid getting caught in a darker conspiracy 
PIXAR does it again with top-notch computer graphics, wonderful voicework, a really creative setup, nice monster designs being very distinguished, funny moments, and plenty of emotional ones too 
Sully and Mike are the best kind of duo buddies, Boo is so adorable tugging at the heartstrings, and the writers have the monsters fear something not from their world they don't quite understand 
A funny twist of us being scared of monsters but having them be scared of us in return 
I remember seeing it in the Adirondacks with my sisters and we were enamored 
The movie was another hit making over $800 million 
A perfect mix of pathos, humor, adventure, and heartbreak 
I like Jennifer Tilly as Celia and Steve Buscemi as Randall 
Im really glad too they put the movie as a level in Kingdom Hearts 3 
20 years later and the movie still leaves a big impact on our culture as well as animation fans even spawning a prequel, video games, and a recent Disney + tv series 
'Monsters Inc' is one of the earliest examples of children's entertainment that works telling a human story with non-human characters at the helm"
902,monsters_inc,audience,5.0,n,"Another certified Disney Pixar classic. It doesn't matter if this is a Halloween movie or not, all it matters is it's a great movie. 5/5"
903,monsters_inc,audience,4.0,n,A fun time. One of Pixar's hits.
904,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Funny, sad, thoughtful, endearing, it's one of those movies that gets everything right. Yes, it's an astutely observed insight to the immigrant experience in 1980s USA, but it's also just a great movie about human beings being awesome."
905,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Young Alan Kim's performance is essential, as it serves as a rear window to a marriage filled with uncertainty and dissatisfaction. A story about the challenges of immigrating and creating a family while still wanting success. [Full review in Spanish]"
906,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Everything in Minari combines to create a compelling family drama that is powerful, emotional, and intensely authentic."
907,minari,critics,fresh,p,The humanity with which it treats every single one of its characters is deeply moving and makes Minari one of the most emotionally resonant films of the year.
908,minari,critics,fresh,p,"The picture's treatment of these subjects is sufficiently valuable that at least some mature adolescents might benefit from it, a few objectionable passages in the dialogue notwithstanding."
909,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Chung and his cinematographer Lachlan Milne photograph the landscape beautifully, and you see how both Jacob and David can be entranced by its vastness, even for all the trouble it causes."
910,minari,critics,fresh,p,"As a film, Minari absolutely flourishes, emanating a sweet freshness that sets it apart as a distinct reminder that the world is full of many flavors."
911,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Minari is a moving, beautiful delight about struggle-struggle financially, struggle for identity, against preconceived notions, and for unity."
912,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Wistful and passionate, Minari is a gorgeously crafted film that synthesises the bittersweet pleasures of staying true to your past -- and making space for your future."
913,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Lee Isaac Chung's quiet, restrained film examines the American immigrant experience."
914,minari,critics,fresh,p,"In the end, Minari tells us about the difficulty of being, both as a solitary entity, as a member of a family, defeating the group over unity. [Full Review in Spanish]"
915,minari,critics,fresh,p,"It's an invitation to sit with the writer/director, Lee Isaac Chung, as he shares his childhood memories of loss, identity, and the third culture created when two collide into one another."
916,minari,critics,fresh,p,"In exploring the rich, textured lives of the Yi family, Chung manages to find the universal in specificity and specificity in the universal, an accomplishment that looks much easier than it really is."
917,minari,critics,rotten,n,"In turning his camera to more personal material ... Chung seems to have flattened Minari into a rather precious series of vignettes -- varied in subject, but simplistic in tone."
918,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Filmmaking-wise, Minari excels in nearly every aspect."
919,minari,critics,fresh,p,It's a tale so universal that you will bask in their victories like they are your own and your heart will shatter at the losses.
920,minari,critics,fresh,p,"This movie is powered by a predictable, but solid story and some excellent performances, especially those of the incredibly cute child actor Alan Kim, and veteran actor Will Patton."
921,minari,critics,fresh,p,A work whose best ingredient is its ability to balance sweetness with an exquisitely prepared study of the details that keep us clinging to our roots and loved ones. [Full Review in Spanish]
922,minari,critics,rotten,n,"Beneath the occasional haze, it is warm and earnest and sweet. But, too often, that ostensible warmth feels like it's hiding something hotter, angrier, and more restless beneath it."
923,minari,critics,fresh,p,"A family of Korean immigrants make like the minari plant, forbear through hardship, and slowly assimilate to American culture. The more different we are, the more we are the same. Grandma's great. Won best supporting actress."
924,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Chung and his cinematographer Lachlan Milne photograph the landscape beautifully, and you see how both Jacob and David can be entranced by its vastness, even for all the trouble it causes."
925,minari,critics,fresh,p,"What makes this more than just another formulaic feelgood film is the grit with which Chung evokes the hardscrabble lives of his characters, balancing the dreamier elements of the drama with a naturalism that keeps it rooted in reality."
926,minari,critics,fresh,p,A rare film about assimilation that can be equally cherished by both poles of the American political landscape. And everybody in between.
927,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Minari is a story of the American Dream. But Chung's brilliance is in how he adds depth and complexity to those foundational ideas - it's in the spaces in between that we find love, loss, hope, and regret."
928,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Though two last-act sequences dovetail a little too neatly, the word that covers this cinematic experience is ""raw""."
929,minari,critics,fresh,p,"It briefly drags before the closing act, but that's hardly a complaint."
930,minari,critics,fresh,p,"It is a work of extraordinary delicacy, poignancy and tenderness. Whatever else, teaching's loss is entirely our gain."
931,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Sensitively written, sparse and gorgeously acted."
932,minari,critics,fresh,p,"It is a film in which the details, the child's-eye-view episodes, the calamities, the tenderly remembered touches, all sing together like a choir."
933,minari,critics,fresh,p,Its neatness may tempt you to dismiss its heartwarming quality as the packet kind. I don't think so.
934,minari,critics,fresh,p,"A profound, detail-perfect and soulful slice of American family life, with some of the year's most sincere performances to date."
935,minari,critics,fresh,p,"A moving portrayal of the pains of assimilation, bolstered by Chung's writing and direction."
936,minari,critics,fresh,p,"The beauty of Minari is in its consideration of what we choose to love, and what we choose to leave behind."
937,minari,critics,fresh,p,Chung and his talented cast of actors refuse to reduce any of Minari's characters to mere caricatures.
938,minari,critics,fresh,p,"The picture's chief contribution, alongside some extremely subtle and acutely observed performances, is the consoling message that everyone is the same underneath. Films with that sort of one-size-fits-all sentiment tend not to linger."
939,minari,critics,fresh,p,"There is such depth, truth, and warmth to all of these people... Every choice here is beautiful and perfect."
940,minari,critics,fresh,p,I love this beautiful movie.
941,minari,critics,fresh,p,Another opportunity for us to see and experience someone else' American Dream...an intimate story you can settle in with...
942,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Weeks, maybe even months later, you'll still be thinking about it."
943,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Minari is a gentle, lovely picture, one that acknowledges there really is no ""immigrant experience,"" beyond the pure human experience of finding yourself adjusting to a new environment."
944,minari,audience,5.0,n,A beautiful portrayal of the reality behind the American Dream
945,minari,audience,4.0,n,Each family member is tested but the human spirit prevails!
946,minari,audience,4.5,n,"This was definitely a good film. In spite of all the hardships and all the scares, I had more than a good laugh and a lot of warm feelings inside afterwards. Good stuff."
947,minari,audience,5.0,n,"This movie hits hard in a good way. Minari is a really inspiring film about a Korean family who move from California to Arkansas to farm. Packed with gorgeous cinematography, and endless emotions it is a truly stunning achivement. I love how it shows what Korean life can be like on a farm in Arkansas, where the house is a raised mobile home, the film potrays this so well and just the event of moving. Movie also deals with sickness and loss in a beautiful detail. I defiently reccomend Minari."
948,minari,audience,4.5,n,Should have won best picture 9/10
949,minari,audience,4.0,n,The best Korean movie.
950,minari,audience,4.5,n,"This is a semi authobiographical film of Director Chung's upbringing.  A story about immigration and starting life in the United States, it rings true to it's present day as a Korean family plops onto an Arkansas farm.  It is modest and specific.  It presents childhood as authentic.  There is perhaps no film more American than this, despite it being almost entirely in Korean."
951,minari,audience,4.0,n,"When they say movies are a window into the lives of characters, or story or a peek into history, Minari is such a film. Image starting a life with limited resources, but dreaming big, in a place that doesn't dream big? Would you survive, or would you give up to fit in? Now, watch Minari, and you'll appreciate this simple tale of the family comes first storyline."
952,minari,audience,3.0,n,"Minari is great. It builds on lofty ideals to execute a deeply personal view of both a family, some characters, and the world they inhabit. It's devoid of most of the things you'd expect from a film with such lofty ambitions. It trades forward-thinking cultural commentary for a much more subtle, much more modest view of family, togetherness, and accepting things as they come. 

Some say that this film represents an American dream. And I think it's better to say that this is an American tragedy; those who have seen the film will likely agree. But those little tragedies that fill every life lead to a fulfilling whole. That whole is filled with life, all joys and problems combined into an ugly mess of something. What that ""something"" is will be unique to everyone, but this ""something"" exemplifies the uniqueness of so many different people.

Okay, that's lovely, poetic talk. But this doesn't explain why the film is great. And in a lot of ways, it's premise is its downfall. It is modest almost to a fault. It's so diligently exploring this one, tiny example of reality that it really takes the power of the entire film to carry it across the finish line. While the score is and directing is fantastic, the drama on display simple and stern, and the overall execution fine, it definitely feels like a film that is doing its best to wrap up into a cohesive whole. It stumbles, very similarly to the family in the story; Minari can be very unclean, and obtuse at times. You might be looking for that meaning the film is obviously trying to communicate, but it can seem elusive, as if the film is trying to hide itself from you as a viewer.

But this film is for the climax. The film may meander throughout its second act, but its third act is a beacon, really grabbing you as a viewer and captivating you with the excellent performances of the actors. It's able to wrap up all its themes in fantastic fashion. Does that make up for its confusing arc, just because the conclusion is good? That's debatable. But you can't argue results, once you get to the end of everything.

In the end, Minari is a messy and confusing film, but one that is worth the time. It is certainly unique, and definitely hits the mark it was aiming for. The form may leave a lot to be desired, but the execution is all that matters."
953,minari,audience,5.0,n,"An arrestingly tranquil motion picture, that at the same time is as powerful as all the performances in it. Chungs' 2020 feature debut brims with bright sunshine and blue moonlight, a stunning look at the American dream."
954,minari,audience,4.5,n,"This is a very moving story. There is lot to think about afterwards - the fear of illness, the relationship between husband and wife, the friendship with co-workers, the interference among relatives, etc. At one point when the doctor brought good news, I ended up sobbing out loud in the theater."
955,minari,audience,2.0,p,Whats the fuss anout this slow moving tv movie type pic.
956,minari,audience,5.0,n,Srorytelling & characters are phenomenal.
957,minari,audience,5.0,n,Delightful story about a family striving for a better life.
958,minari,audience,5.0,n,"There wasn't anything not to like about the movie. It wasn't just a portrayal of an immigrant family. It wasn't just a tear-jerking family melodrama. We can all see ourselves in any character in some time in our lives, yet without demanding overly burdensome emotion. We all can relate to the story as ours with varying circumstances."
959,minari,audience,5.0,n,Out of the ordinary beautiful family story !!
960,minari,audience,4.5,n,"It was both beautifully written, and executed. Really great film."
961,minari,audience,5.0,n,"Heart warming film truly authentic it’s not a cliche sort of film it’s well thought provoking and brings you laughter, thoughtfulness and a surge of emotions I loved it"
962,minari,audience,5.0,n,"An absolutely wonderful, heart-filling movie"
963,minari,audience,5.0,n,"This is a well-crafted, well-told classic ""indie"" movie, telling the American experience with the viewpoint of an immigrant family.  It works on almost every level: the story telling, the performances, the camera work, even the score.  

Its Oscar nominations were well-earned, and I would say more were due, especially  Han Ye-Ri for her performance as the mother and Lachlan Milne for cinematography.  Watch this movie!"
964,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,fresh,p,"FEAR STREET PART ONE: 1994 plays on horror tropes and high school angst, all while kicking off an exciting new trilogy."
965,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,fresh,p,"A clever-enough twist on old slasher tropes, full of wonderful characters, and with a sweet queer romance at its heart, this looks like the start of a thrilling new film cycle."
966,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,fresh,p,"Truthfully, it's kind of sad that a film that exults in its R-ratedness to this extent is instead a Netflix exclusive, but if it gets more audiences to take a chance on bread-and-butter horror like this, I can't complain."
967,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,fresh,p,"It looks like director Janiak sat the art director down for a Scream marathon and said ""I want it to look like that"". And it does. It really does."
968,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,fresh,p,...the absence of wholeheartedly compelling protagonists goes a long way towards perpetuating the sporadically tedious vibe.

1015,hive,critics,fresh,p,"As a statement -- a universal statement -- on how women are so often treated as chattel, or worse, Basholli has constructed something every bit as inspiring as it is powerful."

1094,one_for_the_money,audience,3.0,n,"Good watch, probably won't watch again, and can't whole-heartedly recommend.

This is like a New Jersey version of ""Bounty Hunter"" with a lower production value and a less believable bounty hunter, which is part of the joke.

The story is pretty dark and lacks any uplifting sense of charm, but the story structure is pretty good and there is plenty of character growth.

There is some humor and decent action, but there just isn't much to return to when it comes down to it and there are much better movies to watch, ""Domino"" for instance."
1095,one_for_the_money,audience,0.5,p,Only redeeming quality of this movie is KH  nearly and implied nudity.

1097,one_for_the_money,audience,3.5,n,I enjoyed the movie. I think it was mostly panned by Heigl haters.
1098,one_for_the_money,audience,0.5,p,Heigl is fantastic... when she finds the right material. This is a reminder that she is terrible at finding the right material.
1099,one_for_the_money,audience,1.5,p,"Hot dang this movie is a train wreck. I think the main character was supposed to be quirky in a clumsy, hot-mess kind of way but Heigl really can't pull that off. She still comes off kind of uptight. Her accent is also kind of inconsistent. At the start of the movie Heigl's character Stephanie is mad at the male lead whose name I forget because he took her virginity and didn't call her back, yet as soon as he starts flirting with her she immediately caves. He doesn't even flirt with her or charm her or anything he just comments on her body and she's all over him. Regardless, the plot is pretty unimportant. This is not an action movie its a romcom. Most of the scenes are centered around the sexual tension that the two leads are supposed to have, but don't. Even when Heigl is naked and handcuffed. Which reminds me, the lead guy is kind of a jerk. Not just for lying to her, taking her virginity, never calling her, and then making fun of her for being upset about it, but also for breaking in when she's in the shower and then stealing her towel so he can see her naked, which is very violating. By the end of the movie their relationship doesn't seem to develop at all and they have the same dynamic as before. As for the original conflict, we're never given a resolution. He's never made to apologize or explain why he didn't call. I think adding this in would have allowed the two characters to have a more emotional scene where Steph admits that she was hurt and we see them being authentic with one another and building their relationship. Instead, Steph continues to deny being affected and the guy continues to get away with his actions. And after over an hour of watching the actors painfully try to feign attraction for one another we don't even get an on-screen kiss. What kind of romcom skimps you on the kiss??? Unless you're looking for material to add to a presentation about why Katherine Heigl sucks there's no reason to watch this."
1100,one_for_the_money,audience,0.5,p,Well this is a poor film basically. It's nowhere near the bounty hunter an that was a bad film too. They built this movie up to be a more stylish role for Katherine but it just is worse than normal for her.

1140,kickin_it_old_school,audience,1.0,p,"Just awful.  The concept is great - 80s breakdancing kid lapses into a coma for 20 years.  Fish out of water, 80s retro references - it could have been a good movie.  But everything else was awful.  The cliches, the acting, the cinematography, even the dancing.  Jamie Kennedy is supposed to be a comedian.  I don't think I laughed at all through this."
1141,kickin_it_old_school,audience,2.5,p,"I decided to give this a ""slightly"" better score than the audience score.  There were many things that failed tremendously with this movie.  I think the concept was a good one, but it failed from a massively poor execution.  For one thing, the directing must have been at fault.  There was a pretty good cast and an interesting array of talent involved.  I'm what you'd call a die-hard Jamie Kennedy fan.  He's miraculously talented, but he couldn't help save this movie from the ash heap of mostly idiocy that it was.  Notwithstanding my harsh criticisms, I got some great laughs at certain parts of this, and that's partly why I'm willing to give it a slightly better rating than most.  Still though, I'd have liked to seen a much better overall end product.  The editing might have saved this a little bit more, but I bet it was a rough job to meld this into a final cut for release.  It felt like a B movie with some very funny parts, and with some absolutely abysmal parts.  The script writing didn't really match the individual actors very well.  The jokes and the timing were off, or just not so good in many instances, with a few very good exceptions of course.  Again, the core concept was a good one, but the script writing and the directing seemed to misfire hard on this.  Never-mind though, because I'm a Jamie Kennedy fan fo-life.  Maria Menounos looked amazing and she pulled off a likable performance as Jennifer in this otherwise drought of entertainment.  At best, to some, this movie might take on a cult status with a few who find the charm in this as an epic movie failure.  None of this is intended to be a knock on Jamie Kennedy.  He's given me so many outrageous uncontrollable laughs throughout the years that I gotta give him mad props.  I wish this movie had also been a hit because it might have given a boost to the idea of Stu Stone and Jamie as a rap duo.  They put out a good record that deserved some great credit, but it will almost surely be forgotten.  It was worth a once over, but I doubt I'll ever take the time to watch this gain."

1147,kickin_it_old_school,audience,0.5,p,"""Kickin' It"" is a terribly written, terribly unfunny flick that relies on poor '80s and '00s satire, along with a cascade of fat, black, Asian and fart jokes. If you don't laugh at it once, you're not going to laugh at it again. And if the bad jokes don't get you, the cardboard cut-out characters and cliched plot will."

Kathy Bates did a wonderful job as Marley's mother and Treat Williams did well as the emotionally distant father who in the end admitted he just never knew what to say. Her friends did a great job supporting her until the end and you also one friend pull away, as does happen sometimes in the face of inevitable tragedy. I agree they should have depi ted hair loss, as most people with cancer do experience it while only a lucky few don't, but other than that, this was a good movie. By the end, you grow to root for her relationship and hope she would have wished for life like her friend Sarah said. I was surprised she didn't. With appearances from Whoopi and Peter Dinklage, nope. I dont understand the ""expert"" negative reviews."

The difference being that ""The Reluctant Fundamentalist"" is an amazing movie with ethical and emotional depth, Riz Ahmed, and a good story, while ""A Little Bit of Heaven"" has none of these things.

We are informed that Marley is funny and likable, but none of her words or actions demonstrate this. I'm not sure why her friend lets her be alone with her kid so much, given she's the sort of person to ride a bike drunk in the middle of the street.

Our beloved Kate Hudson comes back to treat us with another witty,  heart-wrenching romance (as we have all come to expect from her). Kate and the fellow cast for this movie give us a cancer story like no other. As you watch Hudson's character (Marley) develop, you fall in love instantly. 

This movie has become one of my most cherished finds of all time. I have to say, I was very dismayed to see such a bad reception. The movie does drift away from the realities of cancer. AND THAT IS OK! I don't know anyone who would want to endure an entire movie of sadness and heartache without a little humor and zest?! I sure don't. Long story short, give the film a chance. You might just find that it is one of the best movies you've ever seen."

1238,in-the-name-of-the-king-a-dungeon-siege-tale,audience,0.5,p,This movie was like getting a b.j with a condom on. You can see it and feel absolutely nothing.
1239,in-the-name-of-the-king-a-dungeon-siege-tale,audience,2.5,p,"""In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale"" is unlike any movie I have ever seen. Jason Statham is Farmer, a... farmer who is married with a wife and a son. Said wife gets kidnapped and said son stabbed brutally to death by some Poundland LOTR orcs controlled by Gallian, a villainous Magus played by Ray Liotta cosplaying as Liberace, who is allied with Matthew Lillard's Duke Fallow, who is the Prince John from ""Disney's Robin Hood"" through a filter of heavy drinking and excess melodrama. They wish to usurp the throne of the King, who is Bert Reynolds pretending to be Sean Connery in ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"".

Gallian also attempts to seduce Muriella, the terribly named daughter of John Rhys-Davies's Magus character Merick. He dresses like James Mackenzie's character from that old TV gameshow ""Raven"" and tries to prevent his daughter from getting involved in the plot. Despite this, she still dons armour, hangs around looking incredibly enticing to the queer femmes in the audience, and sadly doesn't get much of an Eowyn moment. Farmer's brother-in-law exists while looking like an off-brand cross between Legolas and Geralt and contributing very little to the plot. There are a group of elves in the forest who look like Peter Pan's Lost Principal Boys joined Cirque du Soleil and they can somehow control vines. This is never explained. The King's army has a platoon of ninjas. Ron Perlman is there.

If you're looking for something really stupid that you can roast with your friends while drinking heavily, this is the perfect film for you. Know what it is going in and you won't be disappointed. But you will probably feel a lot of vicarious embarrassment for everybody involved."
1240,folks,critics,rotten,n,Very simple and trivial. [Full Review in Spanish]
1241,folks,critics,rotten,n,"Folks! stinks! But Robert Klane's screenplay for this fatally flawed, off-beat, black-humored comedy does have some almost redeeming values."
1242,folks,critics,rotten,n,"Don Ameche and Anne Jackson are the parents, and they both look absolutely miserable."
1243,folks,critics,rotten,n,The film's appeal will depend largely on whether you feel like laughing at senile dementia and automobile accidents.
1244,folks,critics,rotten,n,"Senility and attempted suicide are used to supposed comic effect as Selleck wanders around in various states of disarray, probably wondering what on earth he did to end up in this dreadful film."
1245,folks,critics,rotten,n,"It is an unnecessarily cruel little film that attempts to evoke humor from the afflictions of old age, while using the bungling of an elderly parent to thrash a younger man into submission."
1246,folks,critics,rotten,n,"[Director Kotcheff] treats material that might have been effective as dark, nightmare comedy as something bright, bouncy and frivolous, an approach that kills all the laughs and turns shock into mere tastelessness."
1247,folks,critics,rotten,n,"For the final third, we don't know whether to laugh at or be appalled by Selleck's attempts to murder a couple of old people by such methods as pushing them onto the highway in a gas-drenched Ford Pinto."
1248,folks,critics,rotten,n,"Klane has written this one as less of a slow burn, going instead for obnoxiously stunt-filled, madcap farce, all the way to the high-concept-reinforcing title exclamation point."
1249,folks,critics,rotten,n,"Marking severe career setbacks for Ameche and Selleck, Folks! represents an obvious miscalculation as to the low intelligence of the mass audience."
1250,folks,critics,rotten,n,A comedy only Dr. Kevorkian could have loved.

1278,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,Nina feels like a movie made by people who fundamentally misunderstood Nina Simone. It conclusively proves that representation behind the camera is as important as representation on screen.
1279,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,"This film had a great opportunity to take a once-in-a-lifetime story about a troubled, legendary singer, and add insight. Nina, in the most frustrating way, bungles that mission."

1283,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,"While Saldana gives her very best in trying to embody the essence of Miss Simone with equal support from co-star David Oyelowo, both are confined to a weak script and for Saldana, probably the worst makeup job she's had on the big screen."
1284,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,"All in all, Nina is watchable in and of itself, but I can't recommend your paying full price for it, especially if you're a Nina Simone devotee."

1289,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,"Zoe Saldana's woeful casting is just one of a myriad of reasons to despise Nina, as its plot and characterization fail to glean any insight into the iconic musician and Civil Rights activist."
1290,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,"Why Mort, who wrote and directed the film, has chosen to focus on Simone's troubled 1990s period in France is anyone's guess."
1291,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,Nina teaches us an important lesson about waiting for a film to come out before criticizing it. For it is only then that we can know how truly heinous it is.
1292,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,The word on this Nina Simone biopic has been so toxic for so long - it was filmed in 2012 but only released now - I was really hoping to find something good in it. No luck.

1308,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,"Writer-director Cynthia Mort focuses on Simone's late-career relationship with her nurse-turned-manager, and isn't able to branch out and grasp the story of Simone's art or her impact."

1311,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,"Coming less than a year after What Happened, Miss Simone? the fiction film Nina may feel even shabbier than it is. And it is shabby, as well as disjointed, superficial and just plain dull, a dislikable rendering of a tumultuous life."

1314,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,"Nina has been so thoroughly misconceived, on virtually every level, that the only less interesting portrait imaginable would be one that takes place entirely when Nina Simone was in utero."
1315,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,"Nina's true, accidental subject quickly reveals itself as the irreducibility of Simone herself: Little of her genius and complexity have been squeezed into this film's familiar three-act structure of friendship and redemption."
1316,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,The film is committed to the sort of broad strokes that reduce a great artist's life to a spectacle of self-pity.
1317,nina_2016,critics,rotten,n,"While not a disaster for the ages, there's still a lot to Nina that feels like a fib."
1318,nina_2016,audience,4.0,n,nina is a film that has a great script but the actors and the cast is not so good.
1319,nina_2016,audience,1.5,p,As far as autobiographies girl Nina is definitely at the bottom of the barrel. After watching this film I learned very little about Nina and a bunch of the film is her just singing music. The movie is miss cast with what seems forced performances. The script was also pretty bad. The movie had good intentions but it’s also pretty boring.
1320,nina_2016,audience,0.5,p,"awful.  poorly casted, poorly written."
1321,nina_2016,audience,0.5,p,"Terrible casting; it tanked the entire movie. Nina's story needs to be told, but not like this."
1322,nina_2016,audience,3.0,n,"The best bit of this film is Zoe Saldana's performance as Nina Simone, I thought she was spot on playing the singer at her most self destructive. What lets the film down a little is the way it is edited.  It flits through various times in her life often without purpose.  The focus is on Nina's later years and her relationship with her assistant who tried his best to look after the singer and save her career.  It's a film with a strong decent lead and some very good music, it's just a shame that the rest of the film can't lift this up to the level of better musical biopics such as Walk the Line, Ray, Love & Mercy, Backbeat etc"
1323,nina_2016,audience,0.5,p,"i didnt even know the movie was still made, this is hilarious."
1324,nina_2016,audience,3.5,n,"Deserved a far better response.  Whatever wingspan this thing lacks behind the camera, is well made-up-for by Saldana's own."
1325,nina_2016,audience,3.0,n,"Nina is a by-the-numbers musical biopic riddled with every conceivable cliché about ""the tortured artist."" Nina never decides what it wants to say or where it wants to take us. Saldana (Avatar, Guardians of the Galaxy) is an accomplished and bankable actress, but she doesn't look much like Simone. That has led to several complaints, including from the Simone estate. A certain integrity and seriousness of intent gleams through, but Nina is just too big a subject, and talent, to be compressed into such a small package. Ignore all the politically-correct, blackface haters. Singing aside, Zoe Saldana delivers a decent enough Nina Simone impersonation here to make you wonder what all the brouhaha was ever about. Aside from some clunky expository dialogue and a few concluding title cards, the film barely goes into how Nina ended up so broken. It does try to give her a half-hearted redemption arc, but it fails to take off without convincing the audience why Nina needs or deserves redeeming. Zoe Saldana stirred up controversy by taking the title role, because she darkened her skin with makeup to play the part. That said, she acts with the right fire and sings beautifully and evocatively. During a long, uncut performance of ""Wild Is the Wind,"" one of Simone's signature songs, we suddenly see why jazz fans swooned at her feet.

VERDICT: ""In The Zone"" - [Mixed Reaction] These kinds of movies are usually movies that had some good things, but some bad things kept it from being amazing. This rating says buy an ex-rental or a cheap price of the DVD to own. If you consider cinema, ask for people's opinion on the film. (Films that are rated 2.5 or 3 stars)"
1326,nina_2016,audience,4.0,n,"uste eden dobar muzicki film za golemata legendarna Nina Simone...film koj vredi da se pogledne, posebno tie sto ja cenat i slusaat...edinstvenoto sto ne stima vo filmov e sto Zoe Saldana e premnogu zgodna i ubava za da ja igra Nina :)"
1327,nina_2016,audience,1.5,p,"Despite Zoe Saldana's fairly decent performance, this film is a disappointing biographical drama to the great Nina Simone. The script is bland, the sequences boring, and the musical moments don't represent her powerful voice."
1328,left_behind_2014,critics,rotten,n,"Cage is a practitioner of the Nouveau Shamanic school of acting but here he has dialled it down perhaps out of respect to the religious nature of the material, or perhaps he's saving the wild stuff for Con Air 2: This Time it's Biblical."
1329,left_behind_2014,critics,rotten,n,"Rather than focusing primarily on the religious aspects, the film mishmashes multiple genres, desperately hoping for a wider appeal."
1330,left_behind_2014,critics,rotten,n,"For a film concerning the beginning of the end of times, Left Behind sure is bereft of any kind of tension."
1331,left_behind_2014,critics,rotten,n,"Left Behind is essentially a bad disaster movie, but I swear to God I've seen worse movies this year, and worse Nicolas Cage movies at that. I can't in good faith tell you to see it, but I'd be lying if I told you I didn't enjoy it."
1332,left_behind_2014,critics,rotten,n,"The basic premise of the film could have made for an engaging and far-out watch. The very concept of the Rapture could have been depicted with power and mystery, but instead the opposite is achieved in a film that just looks slapdash."
1333,left_behind_2014,critics,rotten,n,"Overt Christian messages and Cage's omnipresence are not the only reasons why Left Behind is a terrible movie. And yes, it's indeed terrible-god-awful, a less interesting, more convoluted version of the original Left Behind."
1334,left_behind_2014,critics,rotten,n,This new film is a watered-down and somewhat changed version of the earlier movie with a bigger budget and not much else. There is barely enough undercooked scriptural theology to critique in the vacuous writing and painful acting.

1336,left_behind_2014,critics,rotten,n,"The effects are hilarious, the sets are rinky-dink, and the character names are funnier than a full season of 'Big Bang Theory,' and the ""narrative arc"" of our heroine is laughably predictable."

All John Derek did while directing Bolero is showing off his beautiful wife (Bo Derek). The plot and writing is just lazy, pathetic, idiotic, and pointless. Exactly one hour into this movie, Ayre (Bo Derek) got what she wanted yet we have to watch this trash for another forty minutes? Poor casting may I add. I mean come on. Bo Derek and Ana Obregón playing college students? There are a lot of nonsensical moments throughout the film like for example, Ayre jumped out of a plane (without a parachute) and survived...really? Idiotic writing at best. The acting was garbage as well. Bo Derek and Andrea Occhipinti were terrible. John Derek's directing is also awful. Especially since he thinks it's a good idea to have people do inappropriate scenes when they're not supposed to perform such scenes. That's just insane and idiotic. At the end of the day, Bolero is just awful. The directing is awful, the writing is awful, and the acting is awful. The entire movie is awful. Bolero should not even be considered a ""so bad it's good"" kind of movie."
1406,bolero_1984,audience,0.5,p,"The first time I saw the movie Bolero, I thought it was laughably incompetently awful. Now that I revisit the movie for this list, as well as scan through John Derek's filmography, I noticed one thing in common. All of his movies are schlocky low budget films about sexual fantasies or contrived romances usually starring his wife Bo Derek. Bolero is another entry, except it's about a college graduate Mac (Bo Derek) who's excited to travel around the world and lose her virginity to either a Moroccan sheik (Greg Benson) or a Spanish matador (Andrea Occhipinti). This movie is extravagantly well-known for its awkward sex scenes, overuse of extreme close-ups, horrific acting and even worse writing and direction from John Derek. The sheik's storyline is entirely useless and only serves as the comic foil who drops asleep during sex and is forgotten for the most part. Angel the bullfighter is reduced to this one-dimensional hot bod who Mac ends up marrying at the end. Bo Derek, even though she does have an attractive body, is even worse as she delivers her husband's dopey lines in that dorky plastered smile even during the most dangerous situations. Bolero is not a movie, but an excuse to incorporate a director's wife in soft-core porn. This isn't especially surprising considering Cannon Group's sleazy reputation.

Set in the 1920s, a young woman sets out to lose her virginity.   Her mission leads her to a Moroccan sheik and a Spanish bullfighter.

Very weak, to the point of laughable.  Very basic, stupid plot.  Dialogue is pretty silly too.  Performances are in keeping with the general superficiality of the movie.

It's really just a skinflick with delusions of being something more romantic and serious.  

One of many movies written and directed by John Derek where he just used his young (30 years his junior) wife, Bo Derek, as eye candy.  The other ones (Tarzan The Ape Man, Fantasies, Ghosts Can't Do It) have met with similar low regard.

Poor George Kennedy - he really deserved better."

Derek is a terrible actress who somehow manages to even ruin her nude scenes.  George Kennedy kind of classes up the joint.  Andrea Occhipinti stands around looking like Hugh Jackman.

The 80s favourite nymphet plays a virgin again(like in John's Tarzan the Ape Man.)who plans to lose her virginity to an oil sheik but it ends up in disaster. Then she hightails it to Spain where she meets a hunky bullfighter, she finally gets laid and the bullfighter is injured for his troubles. She will make him walk and get his libido back in action, how? by entering the bullring, of course. When all is said and done your wishing you hit the eject button a long time ago."

Together they try to out smart the villain who turns out to be Jon Voight and to get back his wife before it's too late.

Duration/Tempo: (2.5/5)  At 1 hour and 30 minutes, this is a short movie, which is good because it still felt a little long.  Good pacing, but the story line was poor.

Cast & Crew: (3.5/5)  Ethan Hawke and Selena Gomez did well with a bad story.  Enjoyed them both.

Summary: Overall, 2 out of 5 stars.  Our protagonist gets to drive a Shelby GT500 very fast for most of the movie.  This should be cool, but he's forced into reckless situations that put hundreds of other peoples' lives at stake.  Not cool.  This film had potential but failed to realize it."

Fox plays an innocent lost to fhe woes of a cold, heartless world, something the heartless critics can identify with. But it is only a fallen artist, one who's lost his ability to call on the beauty of the muse that once filled his soul, who sets her free. He comes alive once again as his angle reminds him of the passion he had once within. And it's in the saving that not only turns his world right side up but fully transforms the beauty of the inner angel to her fullest form.

1588,passion_play,audience,1.0,p,"The film strikes out, big time. It feels like the director was trying to make a David Lynch or Terry Gilliam type of movie here. He even tries copying their styles and it doesn't work. In a weird way the film kind of reminded me of the movie, Indecent Proposal.  The special effects weren't good here. The flying sequence and Megan Fox's wings looked too cheesy and fake.

There is a lot of miscasting here. I think they casted Rourke cause of Angel Heart. He was better in that film than this one. He has no on screen chemistry with Fox. Megan tries to do the best that she can on screen. Rhys Ifans is way over the top in his role. Bill Murray happens to be the best one here. He makes the film, watchable. I like when he plays villain roles, like in Mad Dog and Glory and Kingpin.

If you see this movie, then watch it for Bill Murray's performance."

1629,redline,audience,3.5,n,It was fun race movie with more to than just racing. The story is not new but then they keep making movies that also have similar plot lines.

The cars are beautiful though and there is some great scenery around Vegas in the hills. Overall I did like the movie.

1631,redline,audience,1.0,p,"Skid Tires On Pavement before thinking about taking any risks involving snacks, friends and Redline because in the end the snacks will be all on you. Fancy posters, awesome wheels and one gorgeous woman is all this film has in store and nothing else. The cast is so jumbled up that you have no idea who's who and why they're there in the first place. Eddie Griffin is one of a few names you know from other movies like Undercover Brother and Deuce Bigalow and he plays a drag racing gambler named Infamous. He's good for the humor and his rare moments of acting, nothing else. The girl at the center of all this mayhem is none other than Nadia Bjorlin, if you're a Soap Opera fan then you'll know her as Chloe Lane from Days of Our Lives. Andy Cheng doesn't bring a whole lot to the table besides the lineup of cars and some i do believe actually do get damaged. Again the characters will have you guessing on who's really running the show, the story starts off as a no caffeine version of Fast & The Furious but somehow becomes the very cheesy made for tv entertainment to give Nadia more screen time.. If amazing exotic cars grabs your interest then by all means enjoy the movie, sitting through bad acting is the obstacle."
1632,redline,audience,0.5,p,Maximalna stupidita...
1633,redline,audience,0.5,p,"To date, this remains the single worst movie I have ever seen.  I convinced my friend to go see it with me by using the rational that ""even if the movie sucks, watching a bunch of super cars race around will still be worth it.""  I was beyond wrong. Redline doesn't even give you the satisfaction of enjoying the cars.  A bunch of fast forward (literally, they FF the race footage) and CG bulls*** makes the race scenes laughable.  Actually, I hesitate to even use the word laughable, because you don't want to laugh.  You sit there and wonder how someone could ever finance this POS film as happiness itself leaves your body.  This movie is so bad it's like a dementor from Harry Potter.  Over the course of an hour and a half, it will suck all the happiness from your soul and leave you wondering why you just spent $10+ to get kicked in the intellectual nuts.  In short, Eddie Griffin's Ferrari Enzo crash is a perfect metaphor for this ""movie.""  It's something cool given to a person who doesn't deserve it and has no idea WTF they are doing, and then you have to sit there and watch them slam it into a concrete barrier, while somehow convincing yourself that a benevolent God can still exist when a Ferrari Enzo is dead and Eddie Griffin is not."

With adrenaline-pumping action and some of the rarest, most expensive high-performance vehicles ever raced and obliterated on film, Redline roars into high gear and doesn't let off the gas until the final explosive rush.

1721,gotti_2018,audience,3.0,n,"Interesting family story, but it doesn't necessarily translate well to the big screen to make it engaging. Travolta does a great job of carrying this one and is almost scary in the role of John Gotti."

1730,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,Here's the lowdown on the latest chapter in Mortal Kombat: deadly dull.
1731,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,The makers of the thoroughly terrible Mortal Kombat: Annihilation haven't even attempted to move beyond their source material -- the super-popular video game -- and actually make a movie.
1732,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"Take the worst elements of martial arts movies, the worst elements of science fiction movies... and the cheesiest sets and special effects this side of Ed Wood. Mix them together and you have something called Mortal Kombat Annihilation."
1733,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is not just a movie based on a video game, it is a sequel to a movie that was based on a video game. That pedigree should tell you all you need to know about the quality of this movie."
1734,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,The sequel to the 1995 live-action video-game movie turns out to be idiotic but amusing low kitsch.
1735,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"The filmmakers tried to get complicated -- and pay a price. The story lines are obviously designed to link the fight scenes, leading to moments of hilariously bad dialogue."
1736,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is doubly insulting; a shamelessly lazy sequel and embarrassingly low-effort video game adaptation.
1737,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"Mortal Kombat was the perfect level of cheesy badness, this is just... badness. It exceeded my bad memories of it, and lived up to its reputation, that's for sure!"

1742,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"Never -- at least not since the first Mortal Kombat -- has tedium been so loud, so full of backward flips and flying fists to the kissers of centaurs from another realm."
1743,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"The first sequel to 1995's highly successful Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat Annihilation adds little to the development of the saga except for a truckload of martial arts sequences and a whole mess of bigger and louder special effects."
1744,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"It wastes no time getting to the punching, kicking, stomping and zapping that passes for a cinematic event."
1745,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"The video game is much more fun, of course."
1746,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"Mortal Kombat Annihilation features evil ninja monsters popping out of nowhere. If at first these villains appear absolutely unbeatable, just wait a minute and you'll see them cower before our determined, team-oriented good guys."
1747,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"The script, by five writers, is a melange of role-playing games, Biblical references, mythology and martial-arts and other movie cliches; it's predictable when it's not impenetrable."
1748,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"There's only slightly more plot than appeared in the original computer game, and the result is undemanding fun."
1749,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"Dark, brash, wholly repetitive and fast-cut to the banging sounds of a techno soundtrack, Mortal Kombat II: Annihilation should appeal to die-hard video games players. But to very few others."

1759,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"The most stimulating, satisfying aspect of this action fantasy is the theme music."
1760,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,It's a toss up which aspect of this drivel is worst.
1761,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,Pic consists largely of choppily edited fight scenes (usually involving somersaults and back flips) combined with various computer graphic effects.
1762,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation trades] the best thing about video games (interactivity) for the worst thing about movies (numbing exposition).
1763,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"Quite serious, charmless and critic-proof."
1764,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"Its dazzling special effects make its combatants flip and fly, spin and soar, all the while punching and kicking each other like jackhammers, only to leave viewers utterly unmoved."
1765,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"It's just an excuse for a series of tedious, repetitious fight scenes that have been staged with no hint whatsoever of originality."
1766,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,fresh,p,The formula works and producer Larry Kasanoff and director John Leonetti don't swerve too far from it. Annihilation is basically back-to-back exquisitely choreographed high-tech fantasy fight scenes accompanied by a high-energy techno beat.
1767,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"You know that when an acting joke like Christopher Lambert won't even return for the sequel, some fragile line has been crossed."
1768,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"Witless, charmless and clueless."
1769,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,There's a kind of grand awfulness about it.
1770,mortal_kombat_annihilation,audience,1.0,p,"Yes, 1 star. It's that bad. Strangely after the large success of the first film, the studio decided to rush a sequel that contains only two of the original actors (the rest all replaced) and force feeds the audience 101 new characters, all who have less than 5 minutes of screen time."
1771,mortal_kombat_annihilation,audience,1.0,p,Without special effects was much better.
1772,mortal_kombat_annihilation,audience,0.5,p,It's a joke very unwatchable
1773,mortal_kombat_annihilation,audience,0.5,p,"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation was flopped and the worst sequel to the first 1995 film. #1. Only Robin Shou and Talisa Soto, but with new actors.
#2. They killed Johnny Cage
#3. Shao Kahn is not the same actor from the end of the film.
#4. Too much actors.
#5. Jade is not supposed to be a villain.
#6. Mileena and Kitana should've been portrayed by Talisa Soto!
#7. It looks like a Power⚡Rangers movie which I'm old for that.
#8. Christopher Lambert, Bridgette Wilson, and Linden Ashby didn't sign up for MK: A, which i don't judge them.
#9. Doesn't have a good VFX & SFX.

1817,godsend,critics,rotten,n,Godsend goes nowhere and takes the whole cast with it.

1825,godsend,audience,2.0,p,Gave it a 2 star because it started well but  towards the end it was kind of forced.
1826,godsend,audience,3.0,n,"Although I will admit I enjoyed most of this film, I can't get over the fact that they didn't just turn this into a horror film.  Could of done way better if they doubled down and went with an R-rating"
1827,godsend,audience,0.5,p,"This movie is absolute trash. Period, dot. I can’t remember any of it at this point other than the fact that it is one of the most hated and worst movies I’ve seen in my 33 years on this planet. Don’t waste your time."
1828,godsend,audience,2.0,p,"This is a pretty bad film. Is it supposed to be a thriller a horror? no idea, but i do know its bad. The plot is pretty dumb, it just feels a bit of a mess."
1829,godsend,audience,3.5,n,"The movie story is sci-fi, so if you like that type of movie you should like i.  What I enjoyed was the awesome talent of Greg Kinnear.  I would watch anything he is in, same with So Niro. Rebecca Romin did a very good job too.."

1831,dark_crimes,critics,rotten,n,"It's very rare for a film to pretty much have no redeeming features about it, but Dark Crimes is essentially impossible to recommend beyond those who have a morbid curiosity."

1835,dark_crimes,critics,rotten,n,"Carrey shows that he has real dramatic chops, but this is a crime thriller served cold."
1836,dark_crimes,critics,rotten,n,"Unfortunately, when you're dealing with Carrey doing a fake Polish accent and NOT trying to be funny, this is something of a mission impossible."
1837,dark_crimes,critics,rotten,n,"The erstwhile Ace Ventura broods like you've never seen before, delivering a performance unlike anything he has ever done. Which isn't to say it's a good one."
1838,dark_crimes,critics,rotten,n,"The film's pace never deviates from its hushed, deliberate, anticipatory gaze - it's stuck in thriller-foreplay mode."
1839,dark_crimes,critics,rotten,n,This dreary thriller is a real downer. But Jim Carrey proves again that he can do drama as well as comedy.
1840,dark_crimes,critics,rotten,n,"Carrey commits one hundred and ten percent, fluctuating accent notwithstanding. It's only a matter of time before his newfound artistic intensity will be matched to suitable material to create something special."
1841,dark_crimes,critics,rotten,n,"And to close with a weekend full of choices, ""Dark Crimes""... a Polish film with misogynistic scenes, explicit sex and an unforeseen level of abjection. [Full review in Spanish]"

1854,dark_crimes,critics,rotten,n,"A good story gets stuck in a puddle of mood in ""Dark Crimes,"" a film that strays from its fascinating source - a real-life murder case - into a less successful attempt at noir."
1855,dark_crimes,critics,rotten,n,"Carrey's quietly exacting, uncharacteristic performance, though not qualifying as a saving grace, hints at some promising new career directions in the same manner Robin Williams successfully tapped a darker side with ""One Hour Photo."""
1856,dark_crimes,critics,rotten,n,"A few words should be said about Carrey's performance: It may be the worst dramatic acting of his career, a charmless cartoon of self-repression."
1857,dark_crimes,critics,rotten,n,"The cast is game, the production design is impressive and a few surprises await - but even as things heat up, the film somehow remains cold."
1858,dark_crimes,critics,rotten,n,"There's a lot of sexual violence in the film, but it scans as unimaginatively repulsive, as well as blatantly misogynistic."
1859,dark_crimes,critics,rotten,n,A movie that is not just muddled in the conventional ways but down to its core.
1860,dark_crimes,audience,5.0,n,"First, ignore all reviews that bemoan Jim Carrey not succumbing to typecasting to play another idiot-satisfying-level comedian role (""The Mask"" being Carryey's notable exception, with an instant-classic comedic portrayal including superb physical acting).

Then, ignore comments from the pompous reviewers (professional and amateur) who thrive on and endless copycat stream of ever gorier westerns, post-apolalypse-for simpletons, ad-nauseum cop-robber-drug lord-spies-Terminator, Halloween, and other formulaic claptrap.

This was dark, dark, dark.  Watched it twice to appreciate its complicated plot.  Who cares about any original story (which Hollywood always savage with fiction and whimsy, anyway) ... this transports you into the gray grimness of The Poland That Stalin-build despair.

You sissies who scurry back to the ordinary and hackneyed didn't deserve such a noir tour-de-force.  Special credit to Jim Carrey who, whether or not you like any of his roles, is an underutilized talent who refused to remain the Charlie Chaplin of his generation."
1861,dark_crimes,audience,3.0,n,"It is well shot and Carrey is very different in the film, almost emotionless.
It has a dark feel to it, but the female nudity and sex scenes are really boring and uncomfortable to watch, all of which lets the film down, had they just done some murders it would have been far better"
1862,dark_crimes,audience,0.5,p,I was blown away that this movie had Jim Carrey in it and was downright awful. I felt like somebody who had never written before took over the script. I genuinely want to know what moron butchered this so that they never work in Hollywood again.
1863,dark_crimes,audience,2.5,p,"I found this movie less bad than the reviews here on Rotten Tomatoes would suggest. It's a pretty grim testimonial to the failure of communism with everyone wearing horrible clothes, having manky teeth, looking undernourished, miserable, unkempt and repressed. In that sense, this movie is very accurate and consistent in its gloom. Jim Carrey's default is gloom ...unalleviated gloom....inconceivably so. Nobody could be that full of gloom and still function.

Like many movies set in non-English speaking countries, for some reason everyone speaks English with a foreign accent. I mean, this is just plainly and simply daft....a bit like the old war movies where all the Germans spoke in awful broken, accented English. And they're still making movies that do this??? So Jim Carrey speaks English with a Polish accent, as do nearly all of the other characters....... yep, if they were really Polish and for some reason living their lives speaking English to each other then, sure, they'd all do so with an accent to some extent. But these are supposedly Polish people, with Polish names, living in Poland and speaking their native language to each other.......so why the daft accent? 

I ended up fast-forwarding as it started to drag. Then reminded when I missed the punchline. And then thought.....""so what?"" 

This movie passed a bit of time but I must say, apart from the accurate gloom of the sets and props etc, it didn't have much going for it."
1864,dark_crimes,audience,0.5,p,"Like many successful comedians (as well as successful female sexpots) before him,  the urge to be taken seriously as a dramatic actor has taken hold.  The problem is, as a dramatic artist he doesn't have that quality that makes us want to watch him.  Yeah, he can act but he simply doesn't possess that intangible allure that's required of a dramatic leading man.  If he continues along this vein, he would do better to be a character actor rather than attempt to be a leading man."
1865,dark_crimes,audience,2.0,p,Is this movie really worse than the Michael Biehn film The Divide?  The critics seem to think so.  What do you think?
1866,dark_crimes,audience,0.5,p,"Really?Jim Carey?All he's good at is playing fool's,it's in his nature wouldn't go out of my way ,you shouldn't either"
1867,dark_crimes,audience,1.0,p,"Easily the worst movie of 2018 next to The Predator. Poor acting, laughable script, horrific scenes and Carrey sounds so dull and lifeless."
1868,dark_crimes,audience,1.0,p,"I found this movie to be plodding and Carrey's character was stoic and unconvincing. If this was supposed to be him trying to act in a serious genre, he failed. His claim to fame is inane comedy and this is where he belongs.
This movie might just destroy his career"
1869,dark_crimes,audience,5.0,n,"It is a dark thriller that shows you what is happening and the problem the cop has to make a conviction. Just like real life you know who has done it but other people do not and banging your head on a brick wall does not help. Jim Carrey's acting is powerfull and has feeling with strength, a performance to be proud, i fully enjoyed the story and glad i did not over look the movie."

1873,the_roommate,critics,rotten,n,One dry hump of almost thrills that are incredibly lackluster and void of any sort of suspense or tension.
1874,the_roommate,critics,rotten,n,"the direction of the film is fraught with problems, and one feels that the promising young cast deserved better than this."
1875,the_roommate,critics,rotten,n,A storyline that unimaginatively rehashes countless pivotal elements from other stalker-themed movies means that the whole production is a dull and pointless exercise that twists and turns in precisely the manner you expect it to.
1876,the_roommate,critics,rotten,n,"It might be genius compared to Single White Female 2: The Psycho, but know that The Roommate is ultimately about as sensitive as that dtv sequel sounds."
1877,the_roommate,critics,rotten,n,It is as bland as movies get. There's not one single nod or wink to the audience and it never manages to develop even an iota of suspense. What's really weird is its complete reliance on a slick modern rock soundtrack that never seems to stop.

1896,the_roommate,critics,rotten,n,The clichés come thick and fast in this ponderous thriller.
1897,the_roommate,critics,rotten,n,Further impediments to this film's credibility are the facts that all the actors appear too old to be playing college students and the characters live on a campus that is eerily deserted.

1908,the_roommate,critics,rotten,n,"With few scares and minimal characterization, The Roommate is really just a far-below-par thriller that desperately wishes it were a different movie -- a longing it shares with the audience."
1909,the_roommate,critics,rotten,n,"If ever a thriller were to inspire a collective ""eh,"" it's got to be ""The Roommate."" It's not a good movie, by any means, but it's also not bad enough to have fun hating on."
1910,the_roommate,audience,1.0,p,This movie isn't even bad enough to be good.  It is really just a far below par thriller desperately wishes it were different.  Meester's performance has the feeling of a sports car in neutral.
1911,the_roommate,audience,2.5,p,"""Murder can really ruin a friendship"" While the movie doesn't have a high enough chill or thrill factor it's still got an alright plot, could be more creepy. Leighton Meester was great, loved seeing her in a different role than Blaire from Gossip Girl."
1912,the_roommate,audience,2.0,p,"?
If stars came in fourths, it would be a 1.75, mainly because it's only as good as 75% of the movies that I would normally rate a 2 in terms of horror. This is like a senseless hodgepodge of other movie plots and typical horror, takes mental health too lightly as well as misuses what potentially could have been a much better plot point, and made me get up for popcorn... TWICE. I wonder if the college whose building was on the movie poster sued the makers AFTER they saw the film... Not unwatchable, but not worth a trip to even the dollar theater."
1913,the_roommate,audience,0.5,p,They killed the cat.
1914,the_roommate,audience,4.0,n,"Okay I need to start off by saying I'm not giving this movie a four star because I think it's a four star movie, I think it's more of a three, but I gave it a four because the reviews for this film are so low it makes me cringe. This is honestly one of my favourite movies. The acting is great and the story line is actually pretty good, there is very predictable scenes in this movie but I don't understand why someone would give this movie a one, like come on, there's movies out there that get an 80% on here and they straight up sucked. Moral of my comment is if you haven't seen this movie by now, take my word for it, it's not awful, it's pretty decent. Not a work of art, the ending is definitely predictable but again like I said, it's good, give it a try."
1915,the_roommate,audience,0.5,p,"Boring chick flick , college drama queen story. Not really my thing."
1916,the_roommate,audience,1.0,p,yeah was a good movie an all. but extremely more than f*cked up and made me absolutely hate the movie for the scene where rebecca locks and cooks the kitten in a dryer. could've simply gotten her to bring the cat to a shelter or let it go. they did not have to go to that extent. f*cked up.
1917,the_roommate,audience,1.0,p,"For a movie that's only 90 minutes, it's still really slow. There's not a lot going on. Obsessive roommate is a psycho and does psycho-stalker things. It failed to keep my interest."
1918,the_roommate,audience,1.0,p,"This is a wannabe thriller or suspense movie that doesn't deliver.
The ending is pretty much spoiled for you in the first 30min so you spend 1h knowing what is going to happen and the movie doesn't really build up effectively till it gets there so the climax doesn't work properly.
The directors work is decent though acting is mostly mediocre. The best actor was Cam Gigandet that makes a clear effort to do his job right even with bad lines and a bad story to be a part of.

It kind of reminds me of ""Single White Female""."

1963,speed_2_cruise_control,audience,1.5,p,"Woof!  This movie is a terrible follow up to the original action classic SPEED.  It has one of the worst villains of all time, played by the great Willem Dafoe.  He is a computer genius that has terminal cancer...who puts leeches on his body to prolong his life.  Who came up with this character?  Jason Patric is dull as usual with his extremely limited acting range.  He makes Keanu Reeves look like Christian Bale. Sandra Bullock is also equally as bad, but hey I'm sure she got a big payday for this piece of garbage."
1964,speed_2_cruise_control,audience,4.0,n,"Not as good as the first one. I wish Keanu Reeves would have been recasted but overall, I very much enjoyed this movie."
1965,speed_2_cruise_control,audience,1.0,p,It was bad! I liked Speed better
1966,speed_2_cruise_control,audience,1.0,p,"Willem Dafoe's villainous role is entertainin' and the climax has some glorious large-scale property damage, but ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"" falls far short of its predecessor, and a tragic step-down at that. The rest of the acting (I'm not countin' Sandra Bullock here) is weak, the characterization is paper-thin, the writin' is laughable, the action sequences fail to generate any excitement, the plot devices are so unsurprisingly familiar, in fact, that they're very tired and poorly executed, and most importantly, placin' your sequel on a slow-moving cruise ship (and not somethin' quicker) is enough to guarantee that ""Speed 2"" is clearly dead on arrival. The comparatively lower stakes, don't help 'cause the hero has no reason to get involved  and most of the passengers are safely evacuated; only a few stay since we need tension. So yeah, in the hilariously one-sided battle in which ship-based film that 20th Century Studios released in 1997 was better, ""Titanic"" wins."
1967,speed_2_cruise_control,audience,1.0,p,"Though Willem Dafoe is entertaining as the bad guy and the climax does have some glorious large-scale property damage, Speed 2 is a sequel that's a tragic step down from its predecessor. The acting from the rest of the cast is weak, the characterisations are flat, the writing is laughable and, most importantly, placing your sequel on a slow-moving cruise ship is enough to guarantee that Cruise Control ended up being dead on arrival. The comparatively lower stakes don't help because the hero has no reason to get involved and most of the passengers are safely evacuated with a few sticking around because we need tension. So yeah, in the hilariously one-sided battle of which ship-based thriller from 20th Century Fox released in 1997 was better, Titanic wins."
1968,speed_2_cruise_control,audience,1.0,p,"Sandy, see what happens when you leave Keanu for Jason Patric in a Hawaiian shirt (and head for a PG-13 rating in the process)? You get ""Speed 2: Cruise Control,"" and Keanu makes ""The Last Time I Committed Suicide."" It's not a good look for anyone. But it IS a good look for me to give ""Die Hard on a slow-movin' cruise ship"" The Burnin' Medallion Of Badness. Characters: 0.5/5 Story: 0/5 Acting: 0/5 Special Effects: 1/5 Direction: 0/5 Cinematography: 0.5/5 Soundtrack: 1/5 Overall: 1/5"
1969,speed_2_cruise_control,audience,0.5,p,it's one of the worst action movies
