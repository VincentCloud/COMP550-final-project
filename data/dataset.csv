0,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,fresh,p,"FEAR STREET PART ONE: 1994 plays on horror tropes and high school angst, all while kicking off an exciting new trilogy."
1,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,fresh,p,"A clever-enough twist on old slasher tropes, full of wonderful characters, and with a sweet queer romance at its heart, this looks like the start of a thrilling new film cycle."
2,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,fresh,p,"Truthfully, it's kind of sad that a film that exults in its R-ratedness to this extent is instead a Netflix exclusive, but if it gets more audiences to take a chance on bread-and-butter horror like this, I can't complain."
3,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,fresh,p,"It looks like director Janiak sat the art director down for a Scream marathon and said ""I want it to look like that"". And it does. It really does."
4,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,fresh,p,...the absence of wholeheartedly compelling protagonists goes a long way towards perpetuating the sporadically tedious vibe.
5,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,fresh,p,"A flawed but entertaining supernatural slasher epic, one that is more intriguing for its thematic and structural ambitions than its execution of horror fundamentals."
6,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,fresh,p,"If you have a stomach for violence and some meta-textual playfulness, rewards await you."
7,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,rotten,n,Deena and Sam's romance is a push-pull between two paper-thin characters whose relationship never gains the contours that make you care about its survival.
8,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,rotten,n,"The movie's laden with drawn-out scenes, blah one-and-a-half-note characters, moth-eaten jump scares and enough white-hot referential pop-culture bric-a-brac to melt a million millennials."
9,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,fresh,p,1994 sets up the trilogy with a fun first installment that is as bloody and vibrant as it was frustrating.
10,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,fresh,p,"1994 leans very much on recognizable nostalgia to build a sense of place-hell, the movie opens at a mall!-before getting into the bloody business at hand."
11,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,fresh,p,"It's not exactly breaking the mold in terms of the horror genre, but there are some creative kills and some interesting twists to keep you going."
12,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,fresh,p,It's the perfect movie for sleepover pizza parties.
13,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,fresh,p,"Leigh Janiak and co-writer Phil Graziadei crafted one gnarly horror flick, heavy on gore, guts, and teenage hormones in a way that calls to mind the entire slasher spectrum."
14,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,fresh,p,A fun and surprisingly brutal YA slasher that can't help but feel incomplete given that it's the first of three parts.
15,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,rotten,n,"[i]1994[/i] at times feels like an algorithm gone haywire, unable to balance its homages with its storytelling."
16,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,fresh,p,"A generic pastiche-ing of Scream-era horror movies, but horror fans should stick with it as it becomes more hardcore and emotionally satisfying in the last half hour."
17,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,fresh,p,"A retro pastiche of self-aware 90s slashers, Fear Street treads familiar territory for horror fans while still providing a fresh perspective that energizes the material."
18,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,fresh,p,"This easy-to-swallow conceit lets Fear Street gleefully, bloodily romp around, channeling the ""trashy low-brow horror"" of the mass market paperbacks it honors."
19,fear_street_part_one_1994,critics,fresh,p,A new update of the slasher. [Full review in Spanish]
20,fear_street_part_one_1994,audience,1.5,n,"Wokey, mild entertainment"
21,fear_street_part_one_1994,audience,4.0,p,Retro is cool - I can respect a movie that pays homage to horror's roots.
22,fear_street_part_one_1994,audience,2.5,n,Such a lead on opening the movie with maya hawke just to kill her off. What a waste… not a bad movie in of itself but I can't forgive it for killing off maya
23,fear_street_part_one_1994,audience,3.0,p,Very good idea but not well made. Would not watch again but is a must watch. This is a movie that with your friends you can watch it while you play board games or are hanging out in the dark ready to scare each other. All horror movies are a much watch but are they good? Sometimes. But not this time.
24,fear_street_part_one_1994,audience,5.0,p,Beautiful film that elevates the genre
25,fear_street_part_one_1994,audience,0.5,n,"barely one charismatic character, the story behind is great but very poorly delivered! cant believe people enjoyed this thing"
26,fear_street_part_one_1994,audience,4.5,p,Se me hizo interesante la historia pero las muertes muy fuertes
27,fear_street_part_one_1994,audience,3.5,p,I enjoyed the twist and connections.
28,fear_street_part_one_1994,audience,2.5,n,I hate Meena so much. Her and her ex girlfriend constantly arguing makes for a not very pleasant experience
29,fear_street_part_one_1994,audience,3.0,p,"Nada revolucionário, mas divertido. Com boas referências a outros filmes de terror e com uma trama até que interessante, Rua do Medo é uma sessão da tarde para mais velhos..."
30,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,"It's almost like watching therapy in real time, and it's one of the best films I've seen this year. [Full review in Spanish]"
31,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,A movie that'll make your hugs squeeze a little tighter and words carry more significance once it concludes.
32,mass_2021,critics,rotten,n,"Kudos to Ann Dowd, Martha Plimpton, Reed Birney and Jason Isaacs, but this is not the stuff that movie careers - or memorable movies - are made of."
33,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Directing this ensemble cast, no matter the skill level, is a feat that a first-time director typically could never accomplish, but Kranz does so with apparent ease."
34,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,"The silences and nonverbal, furtive glances exchanged by the married couples speak volumes about their vulnerabilities. Long-married couples will definitely recognize these signals ..."
35,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,A subtly poignant psychological drama that evokes a genuine catharsis.
36,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,All 4 actors are exceptional especially Ann Dowd and Martha Plimpton as the 2 mothers. It's extremely intense and brutal but there is hope at the end.
37,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,"As the film progresses, the words ""Oscar Nominations"" start trickling through your mind."
38,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Smartly scripted, extremely theatrical emotional potboiler"
39,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,"From the beginning frame, we are drawn in and are intrigued by this emotional gathering of people whose lives are forever connected."
40,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,"This film is provocative for the strength of the script and its topics, not so much for how it was conducted."
41,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,A rousing testament to those among us who seek to find meaning in even the worst moments of our lives.
42,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,"In the hands of a lesser writer, this story could easily slipped into a divisive screed about the politics of gun control. Instead, writer-director Kranz steers the plot into a more universal story about sorrow, anger, and the search for answers."
43,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,"An exhausting, challenging, powerful experience that is one of the very best films of 2021."
44,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,In a magnificently human way shows us how to have a meaningful dialogue about a current American crisis that's dividing the country.
45,mass_2021,critics,rotten,n,Mass may be bungled but its director might well have a great film in him yet.
46,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,Kranz finds the cinema in the faces of his performers.
47,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,"I'm hard-pressed to think of a more difficult conversation I've seen at the movies. ... Some will discover it, look up the 2021 Oscars, and wonder: Why was this overlooked?"
48,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Kranz rightfully submerges us in this cinematic powder keg for about 110 minutes, which is just the perfect amount of time to spend with these four people."
49,mass_2021,critics,fresh,p,"'Mass' is a remarkable study of grief and acceptance that's both timely and important. It showcases four of the best performances of the year, and it challenges your own thoughts and feelings."
50,mass_2021,audience,4.5,p,"Rating: A

""Mass is undoubtedly one of the most emotionally challenging viewings I've ever had to face. Fran Kranz's feature directorial debut tells an unbelievably heavy story through four actors who dive deep into their characters, all delivering career-best performances. Everyone is an incredible standout: Jason Isaacs, Ann Dowd, Martha Plimpton, and Reed Birney deserve a massive campaign to receive every acting award there is. The cast drains every single ounce of emotion within the viewers, transforming a tiny little room with impactful mise-en-scène that tells its own story into an extremely tense, heart-wrenching, almost unbreathable environment. Dozens of meaningful matters and challenging feelings are addressed in the span of little less than two hours, creating a truly devastating film that left me sobbing. It's utterly impossible for someone not to be affected by this movie, even if it's in a negative way. It's one of those films that I'll recommend to everyone and support throughout its eventual release, but I can't deny this might have been my one and only watch of such a brutally demanding, authentic story."""
51,mass_2021,audience,4.5,p,"Somewhere between In The Bedroom and We Need To Talk About Kevin, this is the best chamber piece written for the big screen in a long time. Fran Kranz delivers one of the very best screenplays of the year and the quartet of performances is nothing short of extraordinary. Heartbreaking, magnetic, unforgettable."
52,mass_2021,audience,5.0,p,"On the eve of yet another school shooting, Mass is the perfect movie to dispense with the theatrics of extremist politics, and really dive in to the after effects of trauma of what these moments are like for the people who are left.. Raw, unflinching, and emotional.  Mass will reach the part of you that knows this has gone on for far too long."
53,mass_2021,audience,4.5,p,"Fran Kranz, previously known mainly as an actor, tells an original story in his directorial debut Mass, which could seem like an adapted play to many. Six years after a devastating tragedy, the parents of two victims gather in the room of a church to come to terms with the events of that time together. This results in a real emotional chaos between four protagonists, peppered with grief, pain, anger and pure fear.

I have often heard that Mass is a quiet film. Yes, it's not a sci-fi blockbuster with countless scenarios, dispenses entirely with any effects and has only four central characters. In that respect, it is definitely a quiet film. But if you define calm by emotional connection, then Mass is probably the spectacle of the year. For what is rehashed and thematised here rips your heart out. Rarely have I shed so many tears at a film. Rarely have all the protagonists grown so close to my heart despite their different behaviours. Never have dialogues and monologues been so close to my heart. This is largely due to Franz's borderline brilliant screenplay. But in this film it is the actors who make the difference. I have rarely come across such a top-class performance from an ensemble. All four get moments to shine and do so with incredible bravura. I'll start with Jason Isaacs, probably the most recognisable name among the four. His character Jay still can't believe the incident and death of his son. He tries to understand the psyche of the perpetrator, who turns out to be the son of the other parents. Although he tries not to ask too much of them at first, he becomes more and more impatient and angry as time goes on. This leads to a scene where Jay snaps and takes the conversation in a completely different direction. From this point on he is an emotional wreck. You buy both emotional states from Isaacs through his facial expressions alone. Best Supporting Actor 2022: Jason Isaacs, Mass. Let's move on to the two mothers, Gale (Martha Plimpton) and Linda (Ann Dowd). The former is unexpectedly restrained until the last act, before letting her baggage run free at the end. And in a way that is simply unfathomable. Plimpton's chemistry with Isaacs is insanely authentic and if you said they'd been through this thing in real life, I'd believe it. Ann Dowd is much more eloquent in her role and always tries to be the emotional constant through subtlety. Until a final monologue that must win Dowd the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Even though she and Plimpton give each other nothing here. If only there were Reed Birney as the no-nonsense and proud businessman Richard. He talks a lot but never really gets too specific. He is emotionally stiff. Although he visibly wants to open up more, he can't. This is frustrating to watch, but also couldn't be better portrayed. Birney also deserves all the praise in the world for his less emotional but efficient performance.

So yes, Mass is an acting masterpiece. One that I have rarely seen in this form and one that will stay with me for a very long time. It tells a tragic story in such a realistic manner that you almost believe you are really standing in the room listening to the four people on the spot. Dialogue has rarely been so tangible and distant for someone who, thank God, has never had to go through something like this. But at the same time, it's a film I probably won't be able to watch again because of the sheer harshness of its subject matter. Moreover, certain visual cuts are unnecessary. But no one cares about that."
54,mass_2021,audience,4.0,p,Very intense and heavy film. Acting was stellar across the board!
55,mass_2021,audience,5.0,p,Powerful performances by everyone! Such an important movie. I wasn’t interested at first in seeing it but then read an article in our local paper and decided to give it a try. Both my husband thought it was excellent! Heartbreaking at times but such a beautiful story of both sides.
56,mass_2021,audience,3.5,p,Thought provoking if a bit dull at times
57,mass_2021,audience,5.0,p,Felt drawn in from the moment the movie started you are fully invested in the emotions of the characters throughout the entire movie and felt that the cinematography was beautiful for the fact that they are in 1 room the entire time. Most likely my favorite movie for the year so far & for a long time
58,mass_2021,audience,4.5,p,The screenplay never goes to the places you might think like how they introduce a stereotypical gun rights debate only to promptly dismiss it and then focuses instead on trickier emotional issues. The performances here are truly sublime.
59,mass_2021,audience,5.0,p,"Wow- most powerful film I've seen in AGES.  Where has Martha Plimpton BEEN…..?  Can someone please say Oscar nod ??
Heart-wrenching and finely acted.  Anne Dowd and Jason Isaacs give wonderful performances. I hope many people see this - it's worth it."
60,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"A wonderfully bizarre sci-fi rom-com with a polished aesthetic, some architecturally interesting settings, lovely performances, and tragicomic undertones."
61,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,This is the epitome of the 21st (22nd?) century love story.
62,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,Maren Eggert's performance as Alma is subtle and on the mark at all times; but it is Dan Stevens' portrayal of Tom that is the most eye-catching.
63,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"""I'm Your Man"" is an unexpected delight, succeeding as a romantic comedy - and as much more."
64,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"I'm Your Man is an enjoyable but essentially lightweight affair; it poses questions about love, freedom of will, and what it means to be human but doesn't really attempt to answer them."
65,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"A lovely gem of a scifi rom-com that's witty and delightfully entertaining, featuring a career-best performance from the ever-so-versatile Dan Stevens. Definitely my favorite film about human + AI love story since Spike Jonze's HER."
66,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,A spunky sci-fi dramedy that asks some good questions about what humans want in relationships and if AI beings should have rights.
67,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Schrader doesn't overwhelm with the science-fiction aspects of the story (though the scene where a nightclub is populated with holograms is cleverly done), instead letting the human elements unfold gracefully and into unexpected directions."
68,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Some more original elements could have made I'm Your Man a more memorable and powerful experience. As is, the movie won't become a genre classic, but sci-fi and rom-com fans will still find it an enjoyable watch."
69,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Ultimately, this film leaves you thinking as much as it leaves you smiling."
70,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,The bittersweet tone provides just the right setting for an understated setting where holograms and sentient robots seem almost natural.
71,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,I'm Your Man is a very satisfying genre-defying cross between Her and Ex Machina and any Kate Hepburn romantic comedy - but from a decidedly feminist point of view.
72,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Here's a rom-com with heart and depth. Maria Schrader's I'm Your Man presents a powerful examination of the nature of love and what qualifies as having a 'soul', which is to say, what it means to exist with meaning."
73,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"A thoughtful film that both tugs at our heart and makes us think, and Dan Stevens and Maren Eggert turn in strong, affecting performances that help propel the film."
74,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,Robot Tom is like a puppy who is hit by a newspaper ... still loving but with a little hurt behind his eyes. A romantic story that actually has something to say about romance.
75,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,Utterly delightful is the only way to describe I'm Your Man.
76,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"It's a rich story full of fun, wonder, lapses and questions about the ethics of robot love and partnership, big questions dealt with in sweet ways."
77,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"A delightful exploration of humanity and love, I'm Your Man is a rom-com that thankfully never quite goes where you expect."
78,im_your_man_2021,critics,rotten,n,There was not enough rom or com or sci-fi in this rom-com sci-fi film. This was a cool concept where they didn't really add anything to the genre.
79,im_your_man_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Honestly, if Jane Austen were alive and writing on a MacBook, she might come up with something like this."
80,im_your_man_2021,audience,4.5,p,"Presents both sides of the argument well: on one hand, fashioning your own dream partner is living in a make-believe world, but on the other hand, finding companionship in ANY reasonable way is life-fulfilling and life-affirming."
81,im_your_man_2021,audience,5.0,p,"I wondered whether the premise would wear thin, but I needn't have worried. The film keeps you guessing right up to the unpredictable final moments. Very warmly recommended!"
82,im_your_man_2021,audience,4.5,p,"Beautiful cinematographic and script, one of the best films of 2021"
83,im_your_man_2021,audience,5.0,p,"I was ready to not like it but I did like it. I gave it a chance because it seems like it might be interesting and creative in its exploration, and it was."
84,im_your_man_2021,audience,5.0,p,Absolutely captivating film! While I typically don't watch subtitles films---this is worth watching. Maren Eggert and Dan Stevens are incredible in their roles. The film had some funny parts but also heart-breaking scenes. It is a MUST WATCH if you need something different. (Buy or rent on Apple TV). I definitely see this film being nominated for movie awards!
85,im_your_man_2021,audience,5.0,p,"Amazing movie with layered performances. Somehow a comedy, but full of deep thought and stunning revelations about humanity and love. I suggest purchasing it, as you will want to watch it again. And again."
86,im_your_man_2021,audience,4.0,p,"This is a really delightful, off-kilter comedy with surprising insight into human relationships. Dan Stevens is a comic delight, speaking German throughout, as a robot designed and submitted for approval and evaluation as a lover/companion for a single professional woman. I hope this is Germany's submission in the Oscar race for Best Foreign Language Film. It's pretty great."
87,im_your_man_2021,audience,4.0,p,"I’m Your Man is a very interesting sci-fi romance. Dan Stevens and Maren Eggert were both great. I liked how their relationship developed throughout the film. The film tackles its themes of loneliness and love very well. It kept me engaged throughout. Overall, I quite enjoyed this. It’s smart, funny, and never boring. It takes a smart concept and develops it well. Definitely check it out."
88,im_your_man_2021,audience,4.0,p,"Stevens e o comoara, restul e bun"
89,im_your_man_2021,audience,5.0,p,Fantastic. I don't really know where to start as I'm caught up in my emotions. Beautiful film. Existential for sure. A+
90,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Despite the unexplained language barriers or farfetched plot, this delightfully delicious foray into the unimaginable never becomes preachy or immature."
91,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"This is a film about a rat who becomes a chef in Paris. But it's so much more than that. It's about what a great artist can be, where a great artist can come from, it's about food and how to savour it."
92,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"A love letter to Paris, a valentine to the fine art of cooking, and a gift to film fans of all ages."
93,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,A delectable treat that represents the finest qualities in animation and American cinema.
94,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,Has great vocal performances throughout and is about a character figuring out where they belong and finally being accepted there. I love it!
95,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"That is the (...) imperative message of Ratatouille. Everyone is not an artist, but anyone could be an artist. Because, as living creatures, it is simply what we do."
96,ratatouille,critics,rotten,n,"The studio's latest effort offers beautiful and strikingly realistic animation, but the flawed concept should have been scrapped..."
97,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"I won't spoil the broth, but suffice to say Ratatouille is a bursting with bright flavors, some spice, and deep warmth that settles in your belly and satisfies body and soul."
98,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"There is so much to enjoy and celebrate here, Ratatouille deserves more than a review: it could (and probably will) inspire books about creativity and good taste."
99,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Ratatouille was written and directed by Brad Bird, the guy behind The Incredibles, and while his new movie isn't as brainy as that one, it has lots of lovely touches to appeal to parents as well as kids."
100,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Ratatouille is a triumph that not only pays tribute to the spirit of discovery, but revels in the fun of making a few of its own."
101,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"And there's Remy himself, voiced by irreverent comic Patton Oswalt. Yes, he's a rat, and a pantless one at that, but he's a charming rat."
102,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,The latest from Pixar and Oscar winning writer-director Brad Bird is a fabulously enjoyable parable about the pursuit of excellence and rising above the preconceptions of others.
103,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"It's not just the best animated film this year, it's the best animated film to come out of the U.S. since Bird's last effort, The Incredibles."
104,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Like the snooty restaurant critic Anton Ego (voiced by Peter O'Toole), we enter Ratatouille thinking we've tasted it all, and we leave hoping for seconds."
105,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,It's a great programme for all the family.
106,ratatouille,critics,rotten,n,It's not my favourite Pixar film.
107,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"No restaurant has ever benefited from placing rats in a recipe, but the digital wizards in Pixar's kitchen have cooked up a winning peasant dish in Ratatouille."
108,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Ratatouille is a wonderful, wistful comedy, and a sparkling return to form for the computer animation studio Pixar after last year's lacklustre Cars."
109,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"As in his previous films, Bird offers up a story with substance."
110,ratatouille,audience,4.5,p,88/90 goooooood very good
111,ratatouille,audience,5.0,p,I love this movie so much I raced a boat my family was on in france so I wouldn't be split up with them but also so I could take a picture of the restaurant this movie was based on
112,ratatouille,audience,5.0,p,This film is the definition of a masterpiece
113,ratatouille,audience,5.0,p,"My favorite movie of all time, very compelling and very calming basically memorized every scene."
114,ratatouille,audience,4.5,p,i love how this movie tells that food can hug people when they need
115,ratatouille,audience,5.0,p,"One of Pixar's best movies! Remy, a rat, is an aspiring chef and finds a way to realize his dream in Paris. As with every film, Pixar ups the game in animation. The water, fire effects are great as is the movement of the rat characters. The human characters are stylized, but believable in a cartoonish way. Brad Bird does an amazing job as director/writer and crafts an excellent story. Patton Oswalt is great as Remy and Peter O'Toole is a perfect cast as Anton Ego. The writing is also well done, Ego's review near the end of the movie is a highlight. An amazing film, go see it!"
116,ratatouille,audience,4.0,p,Very well made and felt very artistic and didn't care to be made for a child audience and go all kidish. It even went into a partial emotional route which was a well surprise. Rating A-
117,ratatouille,audience,3.0,p,Kinda weird they let the rats run the kitchen but you do you I guess...
118,ratatouille,audience,4.0,p,"One of the best Pixar movies ever made, Brad Bird is an amazing director, the movie can be enjoyable for all ages."
119,ratatouille,audience,5.0,p,This movie is absolutely brilliant on every conceivable level. Brad Bird proves again that he is one of the top animated movie directors. The story of the unlikely hero is incredible and written with great purpose. The visuals in this movie are breathtaking. Remy's first sight of Paris is one of the most beautiful animated movie shots ever and the ending monologue from Anton Ego and the way it is presented is the cherry on top of this breathtaking and incredible film.
120,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,"Irishman represents, with its somber and mournful mood, what may be Scorsese's farewell to the sort of gangster tales that largely made his reputation."
121,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,A wonderful three and a half hours... a very human story.
122,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,"The Irishman is grand and ambitious, asking unanswerable questions about legacy, sorrow, and death."
123,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,A magnificently made film about the boredom of thug life.
124,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,"The director's 26th feature film is a meditative and classy offering. Hollywood's old cronies are still the real deal - magnetic, riveting and unique. Let's hope we see them again soon."
125,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,"While cinema is not to be restrained by reality, it is the double standard with which this film is judged that kept it at number 2 for me. Also, Joe Pesci makes it clear he is a national treasure."
126,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,The Irishman is a rare gem - it's everything you hoped it would be in a world where hype often manages to dampen even excellent films.
127,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,"The Irishman is not only one of Martin Scorsese's best films (which is saying a lot), but also a tribute to all the crime movies in which its director has specialized (contributing masterpieces to this genre). [Full review in Spanish]"
128,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,"While perhaps a step below Scorsese's other classic films, mostly because of its length, The Irishman shows that the master filmmaker still knows how to deliver a crackerjack story."
129,the_irishman,critics,rotten,n,Scorsese has never been drawn to presenting actual history. ... The director has done little to add to the public's knowledge about Jimmy Hoffa or the degeneration of the American labor movement.
130,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,"The holy trinity, De Niro, Pesci and Pacino, hand in late career work that feels like the culmination of a lifetime of character studies."
131,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,The Irishman looks inwards and acts as a sorrowful dismantling of one's own myth-making.
132,the_irishman,critics,rotten,n,"Here is the most unpopular opinion of the year: The Irishman is too long, too contrived and, generally, too much Martin Scorsese trying to outdo himself."
133,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,"In a very real sense, Martin Scorsese is fighting against his own mythic legacy. In another way, of course, his return to the form in which he made some of the more compelling American cinema of the last five decades is a perfectly fitting closing coda."
134,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,"Scorsese makes movies that Scorsese likes, damned be anyone who doesn't care much for them. All of his stylistic touches are here, but there's a certain hollowness to the whole affair that's admirable even if not likeable."
135,the_irishman,critics,rotten,n,Little more than an excuse to get the band back together.
136,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,"Perhaps Martin Scorsese's most ambitious work, this biopic of reputed union leader and mob hitman Frank Sheeran (DeNiro) has a narrative sweep that immediately grabs the viewer and refuses to let them go."
137,the_irishman,critics,rotten,n,"Well, objectively, the film is kind of boring."
138,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,"I saw The Irishman in a huge theater on a giant screen, and I did not want to get up, didn't want it to end, and could have watched another hour of it if there was one."
139,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,A film that seems like typical Scorsese until it doesn't seem like typical Scorsese anymore.
140,the_irishman,audience,3.0,p,An interesting story about true people and events. Story could be very bland at times and frustrating to follow with all time time jumping.
141,the_irishman,audience,3.5,p,"nice try, with the (little spooky) digitalized faces....unfortunately, odd-looking, on the 75yr+ bodies..
and, apparently Jimmy Hoffa spent A LOT of time in his dressing gown & PJs
Gotta love all those wise guys though!"
142,the_irishman,audience,4.0,p,"A great movie BUT it resembles a lot to other mafia movies, and it is as long as they are. In other words, I believe that you will have very much the same experience if you watch Casino in which again you will see very big performances from De Niro and Pesci. One remarkable thing about this movie is that it is one of the first big productions presented in a streaming platform."
143,the_irishman,audience,3.5,p,"It's fun to watch De Niro inhabit this character, and it's his particular combination of tough guy who has frightened everyone around him and just-following-orders hangdog  enforcer that is memorable about this. Nevertheless, I couldn't escape the feeling that I had seen De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci in overall more gripping gangster movies, back when they didn't have to be digitally de-aged for most of the movie."
144,the_irishman,audience,4.5,p,"The movie is clever and entertaining and moves gently along where, in the last half hour, it moves you in a very deep way.  The de-aging of the characters are distracting at first but then settles in very realistically. 

At times it felt like an amalgamation of Scorcese's entire career.  Likely his best crime movie since Goodfellas.  The acting of Pesci, DeNiro, and Pacino are second to. none."
145,the_irishman,audience,5.0,p,Brilliant movie! I was hesitant at first but this is genius.
146,the_irishman,audience,4.0,p,Just overall an excellent movie.
147,the_irishman,audience,2.5,n,I'm a big fan of Scorsese's work but this one just didn't have the old magic.  Not a bad  way to spend a couple of hours but don't expect Goodfellas.
148,the_irishman,audience,4.5,p,This movie utilizes a powerhouse of a cast to portray one of the greatest Pennsylvania crime stories ever told. Robert De Niro doesn't miss a beat portraying a war veteran Irishman who begins to work for one of the biggest Italian crime families the Bufalinos. Martin Scorsese never ceases to amaze me with the detail of his films. And to include massive portions of American history alongside a perfect tour of mob crime life is truly remarkable.
149,the_irishman,audience,4.5,p,"Great movie but both Michael Franzese and Sammy The Bull don't believe the ending is legit. 

Totally worth your time but it's fiction; not a documentary."

155,summer_of_soul,critics,fresh,p,"The only thing more compelling than the performances, are interviews with those who were there, ones carried out both then and now."
156,summer_of_soul,critics,fresh,p,"An act of unearthing, reclamation and celebration... It's a gift, too."
157,summer_of_soul,critics,fresh,p,"Culling from 40 hours of footage, Thompson rounded up exuberant performances from such legends as Stevie Wonder, Sly and the Family Stone (who memorably played Woodstock), Gladys Knight and the Pips, The 5th Dimension and B.B. King."

168,summer_of_soul,critics,fresh,p,"The irrepressible Ahmir ""Questlove"" Thompson has gone and made the best music doc of the year."
169,summer_of_soul,critics,fresh,p,"The music is out of this world, powerful and extraordinary."

I'd recommend it 👍🏼

A QUESTLOVE JAWN"
172,summer_of_soul,audience,5.0,p,"A milestone documentary examining the six-week 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival, held at Morris Park, around the same time as Woodstock. Despite an attendance of almost 300,000; the festival received almost no media attention and recorded footage by television producer Hal Tulchin was not seen by the public for fifty years. Musician Questlove and his producers put this extraordinary documentary together, by placing the festival within the larger social and cultural context of the late sixties, combing music footage with interviews among a cross section of people who were there. It's a celebration of black history, freedom, love, fashion, pride, and faith, but also anger and sorrow. This may be the greatest concert recording of a collection of stars performing soul, R&B, blues, and jazz that gives me a feeling of euphoria. But it also contains a lyrical, stirring rendition of ""Take My Hand, Precious Lord"" by gospel legend Mahalia Jackson and Mavis Staples, following Reverend Jesse Jackson's recounting of Dr. King's assassination a year earlier. Perhaps the greatest achievement of this documentary is that it is not a time capsule stuck in the past, but a living document revealing the triumphs and struggles of black Americans, at that time, that is as vital and relevant to the American experience now. Performers include Steve Wonder, Nina Simone, The 5th Dimension, The Staple Singers, Gladys Knight & the Pips, Blinky Williams, Sly and the Family Stone and The Chamber Brothers."
173,summer_of_soul,audience,4.5,p,"I was a hippie teen when the movie Woodstock came to Israel in 1969, affecting me in all sorts of ways. I've watched it several times since, never tiring of the vision of love, psychedelics and great music. But Woodstock, we're now learning (or re-learning, remembering) was just one event in that important summer. Thankfully, Ahmir ""Questlove"" Thompson rescued from a 50 year long obscurity footage of the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Cultural_Festival]. And what a festival that was! With tens of thousands in attendance week after week and the Black Panthers providing security, Mahalia Jackson, Nina Simone, Mavis Staples, Sly and the Family Stone, Stevie Wonder and numerous other Black performers took the stage, showering their love, artistry and, in some cases, militancy, on an audience that couldn't have been more appreciative. The outstanding Summer of Soul (...Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slFiJpAxZyQ], available on Hulu, presents these fantastic performances, interviews with the artists and audience members, and the historic background behind the events of that year. I cried, I laughed, I sang and danced, I couldn't fall asleep afterwards. I felt huge gratitude. You can bet that I'll watch it again."
174,summer_of_soul,audience,4.0,p,Amazing piece of history.
175,summer_of_soul,audience,4.0,p,"Great documentary! and I hope now that it's released, that it gets more traction and recognition as being one of the biggest cultural performances of the late 60s. More interview than musical performance. So I'm guessing we will see more cuts of this doc in the future."
176,summer_of_soul,audience,5.0,p,It's just amazing to see all those rock stars out there at a festival. Seriously.
177,summer_of_soul,audience,4.0,p,Summer of Soul has been edited well. The mix of just letting the concert footage run and additional footage and interviews is about right.
178,summer_of_soul,audience,5.0,p,"If you grew up in the 60's it's a ‘must see'!  So many memories, so many tears of joy remembering that time. The songs meshed with the civil rights movement! Incredibly moving! And uplifting!"
179,summer_of_soul,audience,5.0,p,"This film is one of the best I've ever seen and is a crucial part of this country's history. I'm so grateful that this footage exists and was shaped into such a beautiful, powerful, and moving piece of art. I've seen it three times already and recommended it to everyone I know. Truly a phenomenal piece of work."
180,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,"We are terrified by the idea that, as Fern, we might have an incredibly frail appearance of stability. What would we do if life doesn't turn out the way we wanted it to? Nomadland provided the freedom we wanted in 2020. [Full review in Spanish]"

182,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,"Featuring one of McDormand's best performances - a role she occupies deeply - and emotionally dissecting the economic terrors of backwater America, 'Nomadland' is one of the best of the year."
183,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,This warmth and genuine appreciation of people and the many routes they take make Nomadland one of the best movies in Nevada's supply of road pictures.
184,nomadland,critics,rotten,n,"It ultimately reverts to homilies, offering a flinty, exciting character a bland third-act volte-face."
185,nomadland,critics,rotten,n,"Nomadland the movie gets lost in its own drift, and, simply, drops off the map."
186,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,"It could well be that [Zhao's] liminal identity, an insider-outsider multiplicity, has equipped her with a unique point of view as a filmmaker."

191,nomadland,critics,rotten,n,"But with its clumsy dramatic embellishments ... and kitschy, faux-lyrical interludes ... [the film] is a reminder that ambivalence is not at all the same thing as complexity."
192,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,"In McDormand's marvellous incarnation [Fern] is difficult to understand, tight, untalkative, but also helpful to others, and given to smiling occasionally in ways that contradict her dryness."
193,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,It is one of the best films so far about the impact of the recession because of the human angle it takes.
194,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,Chloe Zhao's Nomadland mimics life scrupulously...
195,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,"For while, essentially, this is the bleak story of Fern... it is Richards's horizon-spanning photography that reminds us that what we're actually watching is a modern-day western."
196,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,McDormand produced the film too - her performance really is extraordinary.
197,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,People will keep coming back to this film for years to come because its messages and themes are timeless.
198,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,"Zhao digs up something fierce, a little sad, spurred on by a lovely sense of longing and belonging that could be the perfect palate-cleanser after the year we've all just had. Frankly, the open road never looked better."
199,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,"Wander with beautiful, mournful 'Nomadland.'"
200,nomadland,audience,4.5,p,"That's a powerful concept, ""home"". Fern (Frances McDormand) even corrects the idea that she isn't homeless, but ""houseless"". You see, Fern is a nomad who travels the American West and Great Plains, taking part-time jobs here and there and meeting other nomads here and there. Fern doesn't do this in a way to discover herself (à la Wild) or because she has become disenchanted with contemporary society (à la Into the Wild), Fern does this out of necessity. She loved her home when it was a house, located at the edge of a company town in Northwest Nevada, where she lived with her beloved husband and remained after he passed away. The mineral plant closed and town with it — the zip code was deactivated shortly thereafter. Zhao shoots this film like a documentary. It's subtle, nothing is forced. Like Fern and her nomadic lifestyle, the plot never really goes where you expect it to — beginning with the dog. I was expecting to encounter nomads who were ""houseless"" for the more perceived reasons — drug abuse, mental illness, evading the law — but we get nothing of the sort. In fact, Fern wants to work, she ""likes work,"" but work is scarce. It's deeply American with ""salt of the Earth"" feelings throughout. It feels authentic because it is authentic; except for McDormand and David Straitharn, who plays a love-interest (but remember what I noted about this meandering plot), most of the characters are themselves nomads. God, I loved Swankie (Swankie). Her little rehash of her life, why she's accepted her fate, is one of the most moving couple of minutes I've seen in a while. I'm not much of a crier, but this brought me damn close — the beginning is cut btw. (How is she not an actress?!) I also thought Fern was going to follow Swankie, I wanted Fern to follow Swankie, but that's not what we get, and that's okay. I appreciated this movie the more I let it settle in. I like movies that do that. I don't think it'd be my 2021 Best Picture, but I'd be happy if it won. Watch it."
201,nomadland,audience,4.5,p,Went and seen this film randomly through the week with no expectations having not even heard of it. Presently surpired and enjoyed the touching story of this journey through life.
202,nomadland,audience,4.0,p,Predictable but fun film.
203,nomadland,audience,1.0,n,It seemed more like a freshmen college theater project. I had to fast forward through a lot of it. It took me 3 days/viewings to finish. I'm glad I'm not suicidal. This would've put me over.
204,nomadland,audience,4.5,p,"This movie was a powerful character study giving a glimpse into current events.  It's rather unassuming and kind of plods along however, the cumulative effect is a look into the life at somebody that society has left behind."
205,nomadland,audience,3.5,p,"This simple drifter movie is pleasant for anyone who ever wanted to just let it all go, sell everything, and be one with the land, via a van. I think at this point in Frances McDormand's non-beautiful person pilgrimage she has been on, we get it, you're at a point in your career where all you want to do is show up on set with as little prep-time as possible and call it art. In this film, the co-stars came off more authentic to the mission, how to live life in your older age without becoming a burden to those you love."
206,nomadland,audience,1.0,n,I just didn't care about any of these people.  It was over the top but trying to be real.  It was depressing for no reason other than to be depressing.  The premise itself felt unlikely at least with how the homeless people acted as a community while they were all over the country.  Felt like an opportunity for Frances McDormand to do something the academy would appreciate.
207,nomadland,audience,4.5,p,I think Frances is an alien. Only an alien could play that good.
208,nomadland,audience,5.0,p,O talento de Choë zháo fez toda a diferença para a construção de um ótimo filme.
209,nomadland,audience,5.0,p,"Not all movies need to be a thoroughly developed story with character arches or a mapped out plot. In fact, if Nomadland was anything like another traditional Hollywood film it's tale would ring both cliché and disingenuous.

Instead, Nomadland is a story anyone can relate to: where do you go when you have nothing left in life? Taking a setup based on the growing epidemic of homelessness in America particularly in the early 2010's following the great recession, the film focuses on Frances McDormand's Fern. Fern is an ageing woman who lives the life of a nomad, traveling and living in her van after her husband dies and the small town they share becomes all but abandoned.

The film follows what is a seemingly aimless woman among countless equally aimless folks who are all merely making their way in an aimless new way of life. Sprinkled with glints of happiness, hope as much as small tragedies-- Nomadland plays something like a documentary of one woman's travels.

It's beautifully shot, subtly acted, emotionally investing and very much worth the journey."

2,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,Julia is a good documentary film about a very deserving subject.
3,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,"As in their earlier films, Cohen and West are especially talented at elevating this noteworthy woman's life and legacy to more than just what she's best known for."
4,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,Julia Child is so fascinating that the biggest flaw with the documentary is that it feels like it only brushes the surface in the film's 95 minute run time -- leaving you wanting more.
5,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,There are some lovely moments here.
6,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,"...a surprisingly incisive documentary that, while perhaps a bit too short in places, succeeds in its efforts to humanize Child, bringing fresh color to a titan of American TV."
7,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,"One gets the sense that Cohen and West wouldn't make a movie about a woman they didn't deeply admire. ""Julia"" follows that tradition, and their affection for their subject is irresistible. Bon appetit."
8,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,It does the job well.
9,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,"A lovely, intimate look at the life and cultural significance of an equally charming woman. Loved it from beginning to end. Don't watch it while hungry! [Review in Spanish]"
10,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,"The film does a wonderful job of capturing Julia's rich personality and love of food and cooking techniques, and as a time capsule reminding us how much mass-produced, preservative-filled junk we ate in the 1950s and '60s."

15,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Julia is a thorough documentary, concise in a way that's ideal for the casual couch surfer. Like Child, the film's a delight, but slightly unlike her, Julia doesn't bring any new techniques to the table of biographical documentaries."
16,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,This overstuffed French feast -- just in time to whet Thanksgiving appetites -- hungers for more real documentary juice while getting by on mouth-watering offerings from the grand TV cook.
17,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,A leader in America's food movement is rightfully praised and immortalized in a doc that is a pleasure to watch. You can almost smell the Coq au Vin simmering on the stove.
18,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,Lots of footage from her earliest PBS shows in the 1960s plus luscious recreations of such staples as boeuf bourguignon and pear tart make for irresistible viewing.
19,julia_2021,critics,rotten,n,"The food cinematography is the closest Julia ever gets to feeling like a real film. The rest is just good information delivered with no panache, a dish with no flavor that somehow still leaves a sour taste in your mouth."
20,julia_2021,audience,3.5,p,We enjoyed the documentary/bio of Julia Child very much.I had no idea what an affect she had on getting people interested in cooking and getting them to eat well.

30,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,A masterpiece within or outside the superhero & comic book genre it explores. Heath Ledger delivers one of the most iconic performances in film history. [Full review in Spanish]
31,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,A rare beast. It's a summer blockbuster with equal parts brain and brawn.
32,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,The famous masked vigilante has never looked or felt more intense.
33,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"With his smeared whiteface make-up and leering razor-slashed smile, Ledger's Joker is creepy enough to look at, but what he represents is even more chilling."
34,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,The awards hype is warranted.
35,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"The Dark Knight managed to capture something complex and instinctive about the ""war on terror"" era."
36,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"A masterpiece. Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight is not only one of the greatest comic book movies you'll ever see, but also one of the best films of all-time."
37,the_dark_knight,critics,rotten,n,It seems almost cruel to take beloved child archetypes and turn them into projections for adult angst.
38,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"Heath Ledger gives one of the best performances of the last twenty years. When you watch his take on the Joker, it's one of complete surprise and mystery. It's frightening with how chaotic and mischievous he makes him."
39,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"Ledger's performance alone is good enough to make The Dark Knight a very good movie, but fortunately this is a film with even more than that -- making it the not just the best film of the summer, but one of the best films of the year."
40,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,The Dark Knight represents a masterpiece in filmmaking as Christopher Nolan takes the Batman Begins sequel to an entirely new level.
41,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,The definitive movie of its genre and the best Batman film to date
42,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,Heath Ledger is great.
43,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"The movie's a real neo-noir all right, wallowing in darkness, thrilled with how bad we are, and getting such a kick out of our impending doom it cheers you right up."
44,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"Not just a perfect comic book movie, not just a perfect Batman movie, but darn-near a perfect movie, full stop."
45,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"A film is only as good as its villain. By that standard, The Dark Knight achieves true greatness."
46,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"The Dark Knight always ought to be played on the biggest screen possible, and played loud, like a Led Zepplin song. Director Christopher Nolans' skyscapes, the helicopter shots and views from the 200th floor, are IMAX at its best."
47,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"It might not be the most fun superhero movie ever made, but it's certainly the most mature, complex and intriguing of them all. [Full review in Spanish]"
48,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"The Dark Knight may not supply a happy ending, but there is a feeling of exhilaration as Batman rides off from the pursuing cops, and the realization that this is another big step forward for comic book movies."
49,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,The action sequences are like being injected with a shot of adrenalin straight into the heart.
50,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,p,A cinematic masterpiece about the war against terror and definitely the most accurate Batman movie vibe ever made
51,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,p,"My favorite of the trilogy, the plot is very good, heath ledger portrayed a unsettling, psychotic villain, which is the best joker performance yet. The interrogation scene is just amazing. This is one of the best batman films, Christopher Nolan did a very good job on this film"
52,the_dark_knight,audience,4.5,p,This is the best movie in the trilogy. Ledger brings this home offering the best characterization of the Joker. Sometimes Ledger makes the Joker legit scary. Something I haven't experienced before.
53,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,p,"It's a perfect movie. Everything is well done, the acting is all very good, the special effects adequate, a great direction from Nolan, all the character arcs well done and a joker who always steals the show. Side by Side with Spider-Man 2 in terms of best super hero film (my opinion). (10/10)"
54,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,p,"While ""Batman Begins"" laid the cinematic groundwork for a gritty narrative on the Caped Crusader, this movie miraculously exceeds its predecessor by highlighting the moral dilemma of vigilantism, accompanied with many twists and turns. The titular protagonist exhibits enough screen time of brains and brawn, but it is Ledger's portrayal of the Joker that steals the show as he constantly pushes the hero to his limits, raising the stakes in a battle between order versus chaos. Even though the fight choreography is arguably mediocre, I appreciate the more realistic direction as intended. ""The Dark Knight"" remains the gold standard for the superhero genre."
55,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,p,One of the best Comic book movies Ever
56,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,p,This might just be my favorite superhero movie. It’s a masterpiece
57,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,p,Easily the best comic book adaptation of my generation. Outstanding!!!
58,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,p,"Literally the best super hero movie ever made, it ticks all the boxes. I will watch it time and time again"
59,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,p,Till now is the greatest superhero movie
60,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,These characters actually experience and that tiny shift really refreshes the franchise.
61,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,Kudos to Pixar for making yet another film that satisfies on so many levels.
62,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,A sublime ending to a perfect franchise.
63,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,"Pixar's franchise heads into new territory with this funny, poignant, charming road trip about passing on the baton."
64,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,"It may not have truly needed to be made, but Toy Story 4 is just as good as any of the other films in the series and proves once again that Pixar is the undisputed master in the animation field."
65,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,"While I have to acknowledge that it isn't a particularly necessary movie, I also must say I'm so very glad they made it."
66,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,"What Pixar does so well is they take something familiar or, in this case, done thrice before, and make it fresh ... Toy Story 4 is a beautiful bookend to a story that holds a special place in the hearts of many."
67,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,"Although it's unusual for Pixar to continue a series for this long, if each new episode is going to remain this spectacular, keep them coming."
68,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,"Though the film covers much of the same ground from the three previous entries, there's still enough emotional gas in the tank to make this worth seeing."
69,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,"Toy Story 4 is more like an epilogue than a new chapter. A funny, moving, surreal epilogue filled with existential angst."
70,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,I'm not crying. You're crying.
71,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,"Let's hope new renditions of Disney properties continue such correctives, and that genre revisionism will again be in service."
72,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,Toy Story 4 proves there's still life in these toys in an emotionally heartfelt tale.
73,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,One of the most admirable things about Toy Story 4 is its refusal to bow to the easy call of nostalgia.
74,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,At least the end result is a fun jaunt. Anything past this would just tug its threads to a fray.
75,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,"Josh Cooley's feature debut is yet another showcase of heartfelt entertainment, alive with energy and delivering yet another tear-jerking roundhouse of a finale."
76,toy_story_4,critics,rotten,n,"I notice the absence of magic, humor and sense of wonder that characterizes the three past films. [Full review in Spanish]"
77,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,"If the ""Toy Story"" trilogy took us to infinity, the fourth installment just took us beyond. Here's hoping Woody hangs his hat here and goes out on top."
78,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,"It plays like a nice, warm, final hug before we all have to grow up and move on."
79,toy_story_4,critics,fresh,p,Woody and co will make you heartily smile in the heartfelt and wholesome fourth outing.
80,toy_story_4,audience,3.0,p,"To keep their new kid happy, Woody must teach a newly created toy, how to be a toy. This film proves that this franchise has legs after the original trilogy. The voice acting and animation are all top notch, as per the norm from Pixar. This film is very Woody centric, leaving Buzz, Jessie, and others to lesser roles. The villain is weak at best and the film may have been better without one. Not a bad film, just not one that I would recommend more than one viewing of."
81,toy_story_4,audience,2.5,n,a totally unnecessary and contradictory film to the previous one
82,toy_story_4,audience,3.0,p,"Toy Story 4 was ok, but we never needed another sequel. I will give praise for the animation though. Still, I won't plan watching it again."
83,toy_story_4,audience,2.5,n,It was good I will never ever ever watch it again too sad
84,toy_story_4,audience,2.0,n,quite an unneeded and boring finally to a movie franchise that had a perfect finish with its 3rd instalment
85,toy_story_4,audience,2.0,n,"I don't care for this movie, I've seen it once, and probably never again."
86,toy_story_4,audience,3.5,p,"It didn't need to be made, but I still had fun with it"
87,toy_story_4,audience,3.0,p,"Es bastante normal , Toy story 4 no esta ni de chiste a nivel de las demas por que arruina el final perfecto de Toy story 3 , le falta personajes mas memorables y no me gusto que Boonie preferiera a un estupido cubierto en vez de a Woody pero esta bien pa pasar el rato"
88,toy_story_4,audience,2.5,n,Good but they really can stop now with this franchise.
89,toy_story_4,audience,3.5,p,Its a pretty good movie but everyone knows that it should have ended in the 3rd one
90,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"The new locations are vast and mind-boggling, the sets beautifully decorated and detailed, and the creatures more impressively monstrous."
91,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"There are so many moments, big and small, that leave you breathless."
92,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"An epic showdown in gorgeous 3D, packing an emotional punch, this cast and crew should take their final bow with pride before their devoted fans."
93,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"[The film] ends the series so beautifully, and shows such reverence for the books that inspired and affected them so deeply."
94,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,Good film directed for a teenage audience in which not only is magic taught but also how stereotypes affect it while the film itself recreates some British stereotypes. [Review in Spanish]
95,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"Yates strikes a pitch-perfect balance between rousing action, pathos, tenderness and even humor."
96,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"This final chapter of the beloved franchise is a satisfying end to the series, even if it falls short of the promise teased in its slightly superior predecessor."
97,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"It's true it is very different from the book... Nevertheless, I like this movie. I think it ends the series in a very satisfying way."
98,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"I was impressed with the incredible amount of edge-of-your-seat action, the brilliant ways in which they worked the 3D F/X in, and just the way the whole thing came together."
99,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"To those who have loved this journey throughout, it seems a perfect last look at this magical world with a human heart."
100,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"""Words are the most powerful magic,"" Dumbledore says in this film. But words must be spoken by people, and the incredible cast assembled here make magic one last time for what will surely be an appreciative audience."
101,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"David Yates finally gives us the Harry Potter film we have been waiting for; a beautifully shot, incredibly loyal final chapter that mixes heartfelt emotion, strong performances and miraculous action."
102,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"Like the very best fairy tales, Harry Potter offers us a burning vision of our own world, with goodness and evil helpfully labeled."
103,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"The effects and acting are top notch, with a vast cast providing well-developed background characters."
104,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,The danger is seething as both sides battle between extravagant set pieces and eye-catching special effects.
105,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"Deathly Hallows part 2 struck all the right notes of action, adventure, friendship, courage and love."
106,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"We're left just as we should be, spellbound in darkness, with our Harry Potter 3-D glasses."
107,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"Certainly Hollywood will circle back to this beloved fantasy series, but it's hard to imagine that any future film adaptations could be more lovingly crafted, or more beloved by fans."
108,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"Not the most exciting film of the series, but Yates manages to establish the mature, sombre tone needed to lead into the final film."
109,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"The final instalment, Deathly Hallows Part 2, is a bravura duel between good and evil. It's also a cathartic, occasionally clunky nostalgiafest."
110,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,audience,5.0,p,"Great action, feeling like a complete story and loads of emotional moments and rewarding all the fans old and new, making it a great end to the franchise."
111,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,audience,3.5,p,"watched all the movies in Oct- Dec, of 2021 after Brian read all the books from Sept to October"
112,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,audience,5.0,p,"great movie, love it"
113,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,audience,4.5,p,"This was a satisfying and magical conclusion.  The message is that there is darkness in all of us that we can overcome.  The contrast of this to the first film, Sorcerer's Stone, is otherworldly."
114,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,audience,5.0,p,A Masterpiece A Great Saga has come to an end!
115,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,audience,5.0,p,"OMG. I think, next to 1917 and Back To The Future, this is one of my favorite movies ever. Maybe it's just because I am a huge Harry Potter fan (not only the movies, also the books), but also because it's just an amazing movie. The visual effects are great, the best from all the movies. Also the acting is phenominal, also the performance of Daniel Radcliffe, even though I didn't like his acting a lot in the other HP movies, in this one he's got the hang of it. Good job David Yates!
Absolute Must See!!"
116,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,audience,5.0,p,"Maybe I'm a little biased since I grow up watching this series, but this is a perfect ending to the story."
117,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,audience,4.5,p,"An almost perfect finale. Everything wraps up beautifully, and almost leaves you wanting more because it is so good.
It's all been leading up to this, and what a ride it has been. And what a prefect ending to the ride as well! Once again, they brought back so many characters from the previous movies, and made them feel so natural in their inclusion. What a masterpiece!"
118,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,audience,5.0,p,Amazing.  Extraordinary movie.
119,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,audience,5.0,p,The best Harry Potter film!
120,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,An impressive technical achievement. [Full review in Spanish]
121,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The truth is that the film is presented as entertainment, but not so naively. [Full review in Spanish]"
122,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Only half a good movie. When mucking around with unfunny body-swap nonsense, it falls flat. When pondering the deep passions that give us reasons to live, it excels."
123,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"It's comedic, moving and the animation is pristine. [But] [i]t's like animation meets Get Out, meets Magical Negro."
124,soul_2020,critics,rotten,n,I wish the film focused on and channeled more of its energy into that relationship and Joe's own life rather than his bump-in with 22.
125,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Soul [is] a wildly ambitious, sometimes brilliant, gorgeously animated (in every sense of the word) film, all while breaking one of Disney/Pixar's biggest glass ceilings: an animated film featuring a Black lead character."
126,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,[Soul] opens as a metaphysical theme park and morphs into a slapstick body-swap comedy ... It's a quietly joyous send-off to a relentlessly bleak year.
127,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,It's solid Pixar working their magic with a couple rough spots but nothing to truly sour the experience.
128,soul_2020,critics,rotten,n,"Soul cannot make its discrete parts work as a whole of something when it feels like it is stuck in its own ""Great Before""."
129,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"With a simple, yet life-altering moral, wrapped in the greatness that we now expect from Pixar, it's no surprise as to why Soul is achieving a momentous amount of awards, while simultaneously being a perfect family voyage."
130,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,An animated film that infects me when it tackles with sensitivity and grace a rather clever concept that celebrates the value of human life. [Full review in Spanish]
131,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Even if the story hits too many familiar beats to completely succeed, the animation is absolutely stunning."
132,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,The film beautifully illustrates the communion of life's spark and human purpose. [Full Review in Spanish]
133,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,The shape-shifting keeps Soul light on its feet and keeps your eyes wide open.
134,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"An animated masterpiece about a soul's adventure that will get you thinking and talking about the life and the afterlife, your passions and purpose, and the spark that sets it all going."
135,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,The film's multilayered charms - a Pixar hallmark - seamlessly blend heart and humor in a package that parents will be able to enjoy alongside their kids.
136,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,Directors Pete Docter and Kemp Powers manage to land these [existential] ideas. [Full review in Spanish]
137,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"A smart, tender and contemplative piece of stunning filmmaking all on its own terms."
138,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"This may be Pixar's most 'adult' film, in terms of its themes, its mostly middle-aged characters, its sometimes experimental and -- yes -- jazzy animation (heaven is run by characters who are nothing but squiggly lines), and its soundtrack."
139,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"With its fragmented narrative, it feels almost like a shorts collection jazz riff on the theme of existence and metaphysics, plus quite a few of the jokes feel extremely American-specific and won't translate well for international audiences."
140,soul_2020,audience,5.0,p,"I loved the movie, the animation, the story's creativity and mainly because they used Jazz as the main character's musical taste"
141,soul_2020,audience,5.0,p,The best movie of all time!
142,soul_2020,audience,4.0,p,"A perfectly crafted universe animated in best Pixar traditions lets the story dive deep into a metaphysical realm of before- and after-life. There are some beautiful and well thought ideas and concepts, although it is hard to say that all of them are aligned well enough to represent a coherent system.
Otherwise it is a perfect family story packed in a great music box and the best animation and visual effects imaginable."
143,soul_2020,audience,3.5,p,"The film is full of surprises and shows the extremely pronounced creativity of the makers of Pixar. The film raises exciting questions, not all of which are unfortunately answered. Especially the middle part of the film stretches a bit in length. I would have liked to see more of the Great Before. And especially the topic of jazz music me off, because the music is very exhausting, especially when it accompanies you throughout the film. The end was really disappointing for me. It seems like Pixar didn't dare to let the character die, but that would have rounded off the movie perfectly for me. All in all entertaining, but not a new masterpiece from Pixar."
144,soul_2020,audience,3.0,p,Like the concept and especially the message is great. But again we have a POC character that's human for like 5 min of the movie.
145,soul_2020,audience,5.0,p,"Don't make the mistake of thinking this is a ""kids' movie"" or some sort of musical as the trailers' may lead you to believe. It's funny, cute, and thought provoking. And literally any age can enjoy it. Pixar delivers another masterpiece."
146,soul_2020,audience,3.0,p,"Not one of the better Pixar films, but somewhat interesting.  It is a bit like Inside Out, but more to it.  Typical of Disney Pixar it is a feel good movie with some decent music and crazy fantasy adventure."
147,soul_2020,audience,4.5,p,"A breath of fresh air for all animated films. Youth and adults alike can revel in Soul's powerful message. A template that should be saved for the future, and a benchmark for all forthcoming cartoon fare."
148,soul_2020,audience,5.0,p,"Soul is worth every ounce in Gold. The movie has a very charismatic approach towards being alive. The characters perfectly sum up the perspective of someone who lost their meaning of life. It is very vivid, it is very lively. Everyone should definitely watch Soul atleast once, and especially when they aren't sure of their purpose to live. It sets a tone for looking ahead. Simply amazing!"
149,soul_2020,audience,5.0,p,"This movie hits every box on my list that is needed for a what a perfect movie should be. The animation is beautiful, the actor do an amazing job bringing these character to life, and the message is simple and sweet, but powerful that will affect everyone trying to figure out what they want to do in life."
150,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Gashi's sturdy, no-nonsense portrayal of a sturdy, no-nonsense woman doesn't traffic in cheap inspiration and neither does Basholli's film."
151,hive,critics,fresh,p,"As a statement -- a universal statement -- on how women are so often treated as chattel, or worse, Basholli has constructed something every bit as inspiring as it is powerful."
152,hive,critics,fresh,p,Rarely does a film win over its audience with such effortless execution.
153,hive,critics,fresh,p,Yllka Gashi's portrayal of Hoti is excellently controlled...
154,hive,critics,fresh,p,Anchored by Gashi's quietly determined performance as the heroine-a real person whose company now employs 50 people-Hive is itself restrained but powerful...
155,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Hive is a touching, inspiring drama about the power of sisterhood, filled with fine performances, particularly by star Yllka Gashi, and an insightful glimpse into another culture."
156,hive,critics,fresh,p,"[Writer/director Blerta] Basholli has given us a vivid portrait, not only of one woman's real life struggle to put food on the table but also to transcend gender and cultural bias."
157,hive,critics,fresh,p,"A simple story told without flourish, Hive reminds us that necessity not only can breed invention but also the courage required to keep from going under."
158,hive,critics,fresh,p,It's based on a true story of feminist defiance and healing that counts as one of the more affecting tales of recovery to come from the conflict...
159,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Basholli's film is a spare and unsparing portrait of a survivor who refuses to bend to ancient traditions. As storytelling, this is as good as it gets."
160,hive,critics,fresh,p,It's an observant film that buzzes in anger like bees seem to do in a hive.
161,hive,critics,fresh,p,Though the film is a gorgeously realized dramatization...it can't help but feel detached from the actual war crimes that have still largely gone unaccounted for.
162,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Based on true events, the dramatic film Hive takes place in Kosovo in the 2000s, but it speaks to universal experiences of women who overcome discrimination and misogyny to become business entrepreneurs."
163,hive,critics,fresh,p,The effects of political unrest in postwar Kosovo are felt throughout this bittersweet and quietly perceptive story of healing and humanity in the face of tragedy.
164,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Though it doesn't break new ground, Hive still reminds one how urgently significant it is to honor the unique fighting spirit of women."
165,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Somewhere behind ""Hive,"" I think, you can hear the far-off cry of Euripides' ""The Trojan Women""..."
166,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Hive is ... quietly, unaffectedly inspiring in its simple gestures ... as well as its broader implications..."
167,hive,critics,fresh,p,"""Hive"" seizes and holds your interest simply through the drama created by sympathetic characters trying to surmount awful, unfair hurdles."
168,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Hjve unfolds as a kind of modern folklore. Sentimentality is traded for the undistorted reflection of a culture in a certain time and place, when a woman becomes the life-sized hero who ushers a community towards change."
169,hive,critics,fresh,p,"What Basholli has made is a thoughtful, humanistic exploration of the fortitude needed to summon hope in a time and place resigned to hopelessness."
170,hive,audience,5.0,p,"Based on true story, great movie. Must see!"
171,hive,audience,5.0,p,This is the best movie with the best theme I have ever seen.
172,hive,audience,5.0,p,"Forceful, powerful, and hauntingly honest. The honesty in capturing a woman's plight even when she's fighting for others was second to none."
173,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"[It] showed not only was there audience appetite for a big-budget black superhero flick, but there was appetite for one that grappled with modern societal challenges like isolationism, oppression, and technological disparity."
174,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,There's so much to celebrate about Black Panther.
175,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,It's a cultural phenomenon.
176,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,The best Marvel movie yet.
177,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"A tentpole franchise film that broke the mold of what came before, reveling in a diversity and culture that had barely been touched on in past superhero films and that had certainly not been embraced as widely and emphatically before..."
178,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,Boseman's Black Panther is not only capable of fighting the bad guys but is also a vessel for the film's study of the importance of legacy and identity.
179,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"Sure,Black Panther is a mainstream superhero movie with jaw-dropping action, balletic fight scenes, and CGI spectacle, but it is also a measured and extraordinary exploration of race and pride."
180,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"A taut triumph of Afrofuturist iconography realized in the propulsive, widescreen language of the superhero-blockbuster fantasy, and an elevation of that genre on every front."
181,black_panther_2018,critics,rotten,n,Just about the same as every other Marvel title.
182,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,Here's the thing: you can enjoy Black Panther without having seen a single Marvel film beforehand. It is a stand-alone gem...
183,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"As the new king, T'Challa has to wrestle with a few issues that seem topical in today's society."
184,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,Brilliantly brought to life by the production design by Hannah Beachler and the costume design by Ruth E. Carter.
185,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"You know there must be something special about a superhero movie, an action superhero movie at that, to get my mother to see that movie. And not just once."
186,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,A dream come true! Near Perfection!
187,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,Black Panther is likely Marvel's most politically inspired film to date.
188,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"Believe the hype: This is a superhero flick unlike any we've ever seen, crafted by the unstoppable Ryan Coogler."
189,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"Black Panther not only stands up as a Hollywood blockbuster but conveys an adult and chronological context that touches upon slavery, the Civil Rights movement, Black Lives Matter and the current African-American plight."
190,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,Coogler firmly sports his crown in blurring the lines between the cultural importance Black Panther is set to play in bringing down the dinosaur illusions of Hollywood.
191,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"It's still somewhat overstuffed with an excess of characters and some undeniable hiccups in regards to pacing, but its filmmaking is slick, and the cast oozes charisma."
192,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"Black Panther is not just a superhero flick, it's a meaningful cultural hit that shows the power of diversity to tear down walls. [Full review in Spanish]"
193,black_panther_2018,audience,4.0,p,Könnte ich jetzt nicht täglich schauen aber ich mag ihn gerne.

Mais après, le film manque vraiment d'inspiration pour vraiment être bon. C'est très vite oubliable et même dispensable."
199,black_panther_2018,audience,5.0,p,"this movie was wonderful.  It broadened Marvel's diversity and opens the eyes of the audience to a new point of view, and a new type of superhero, and villain.  The villains rooted in reality motives humanize him, adding even more depth to the already rich storyline and characters. Absolutely must-see."
200,black_panther_2018,audience,3.5,p,A great story for a Marvel movie but felt it relied too heavily on CGI at the end with some not so great choreography. RIP Chadwick...
201,black_panther_2018,audience,5.0,p,"In today's Marvel Cinematic Universe, women and those of color or different ethnicity have come a long way. In 2018, the MCU released a film covering the entirety of African American culture, featuring Chadwick Boseman, an African American male, as the main character. This film discussed revolves around T'Challa and the African nation of Wakanda. This film can be analyzed through the ideas of international relations as the nation of Wakanda transforms from a realist state to a liberalist state."

22,mad_max_fury_road,audience,5.0,p,"""I LIVE, I DIE, I LIVE AGAIN...!''

Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) directed by George Miller is a post-apocalyptic science-fiction masterpiece. A truly amazing cinematic achievement.

It feels like George Miller has been studying for this piece of art since the release of ''Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome''(1985) and finally mastered how to make the perfect Mad Max movie.

A modern epic that is completely flawless from the technical standpoint. A movie to watch in the cinema. A dazzling cinematography with some of the most beautifully crafted shots in cinema history. A score that is extremely effective and drags you down to the Fury Road. An editing that is sent from above and that made this picture have some of the best action sequences of all time.

A fantastic screenplay that shows how passionate Miller is about this apocalyptic world. A very effective and emotional way of telling an epic story.

Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the best movies of the 21st century and takes part in the list of my favorite action movies of all time.

''I'M GONNA DIE, I'M GONNA DIE HISTORIC ON FURY ROAD!''"
23,mad_max_fury_road,audience,5.0,p,A classic that will be handed down to generations!
24,mad_max_fury_road,audience,5.0,p,"An epic wonderfully acted, action packed masterpiece with some of the best most intense scenes and music I have ever seen! Loved every minute!!!"
25,mad_max_fury_road,audience,4.5,p,"After the saga endured a long hiatus, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" returns for a roller coaster ride through the deserts of post-apocalyptic Australia. The combination of intense action and an impeccable soundtrack compensates for a simplistic plot. Charlize Theron delivers a headstrong disposition as a war captain who goes AWOL with five female slaves, eventually joining Max in their desperate attempt to escape the thumb of a tyrannical dictator who rules over the wasteland. Her role proves equally substantial to her male counterpart. A conservative amount of CGI in favor of practical sequences contributes to the engaging visuals in the special effects department. Newcomers to the franchise are forgiven, owing to the film being essentially a reboot while catering to old-school fans with a few carryovers from the original trilogy. It only gets better with each viewing."

46,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"[It Happened One Night] is a comedy-romance of much more than usual merit. Frank Capra, director, has taken a mediocre and rather hackneyed story, with trite situations. and made it into a grand bit of entertainment."
47,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"This picture has the pulse. With Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert ideally cast, and... Walter Connolly and Roscoe Karns helping things along, it is just about guaranteed to cure any fit of the blues, and maybe even a headache."

53,it_happened_one_night,audience,5.0,p,"It Happened One Night is amazing, a classic that has aged but remains very current, Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert deliver both comedic and well-crafted performances."
54,it_happened_one_night,audience,5.0,p,"This may be but a wish-fulfillment farce, but well-crafted all the same. It is never dull, and the story keeps you off-balance so the viewer never can really be sure how things will turn out.

A spoiled daughter of a very rich father, tiring of his gilded cage, finally runs off to elope with a daredevil aviator, who is in New York. The father hires a slew of detectives to locate her, but she manages to get on a bus with a reporter who has heard about her situation and wants a big story to boost his career. With that purpose, he helps the daughter on her way to New York, but plenty of things go wrong along the way. And to make matters worse, the father decides to allow the marriage to take place-but complications ensue from that.

Great character interaction and acting not only between the two leads, but between each of them as well as side characters make the story exciting, and the atmosphere of a dull, irritating bus ride and later running through the countryside is perfectly conveyed. Arguably one of the greatest of Frank Capra's movies."
55,it_happened_one_night,audience,4.0,p,"Reviewed 7.26.21  To see this movie for the first time is to have it hit you: all romantic comedies started here.  Sure, Buster Keaton & Charlie Chaplin brilliantly touched on the genre via silent films in the 1920's.  But it wasn't until Robert Risken put pen to paper that this now ubiquitous genre was created.  If not for the cringeworthy way men communicated with women 'way back when,' the flow of the dialogue could have been lifted from a modern rom-com. 
 
It'll seem quaint to today's moviegoer.  Just to think that Claudette Colbert demanded a 'leg stunt double' be called in for the classic hitchhiking scene, before quipping ""that's not my leg,"" and relenting.  The film was pre-code too, but nonetheless, the prudish surface of things pervades.  It's all the funnier for it.  

Add Clark Gable at his still youthful and quirky best, and there's charm to spare.  Without context, one might dismiss it as simple, even frivolous (as many still do today when critiquing the genre).  But alas, it was revolutionary, becoming the first film to win all five major Academy awards. 
 
Sure it has blemishes, the flow is broken at times by odd sing-alongs and quirky asides, but that's kind of the beauty of it.  Romantic comedies still aren't considered high art, so it's the perfect blueprint for the genre it created.  Alone in a vacuum, it's a 3 star movie.  But as it sinks in that you're watching a must-see piece of film history, and a true first, it's 4 stars all the way."
56,it_happened_one_night,audience,3.5,p,"This type of movie is not normally my cup of tea.  Watching it with no context, it is a rather dated lightweight rom com that managed to win best picture at the 1934 Oscars, though few of the best picture winners from the era have aged well.  My opinion of the film improved actually by watching the special features (the main reason I bother with DVDs anymore), particularly the commentary from Frank Capra Jr.  He tells a story of a picture that was not considered to be much of anything by its lead actress, who insisted she had to go on vacation in four weeks and the film simply had to be done in that timeframe.  The result of this hectic and frenetic shooting schedule was a film that FEELS frenetic in terms of its pacing, and it took someone pointing this out to me to see what an amazing, seat-of-your-pants thing it was that the film got made at all, let alone to the great acclaim it received from audiences and critics.  This certainly deepened my respect for if not my enjoyment of this film.  It's got some really funny sequences and is worth the watch!"
57,it_happened_one_night,audience,4.0,p,"This was an enjoyable watch and the movie was clearly well-crafted, made particularly obvious by how tons of rom-coms have drawn inspiration from it. I had actually never seen Clark Gable in a movie before and found myself surprised at how slight and skinny he seemed. Most of the comedy has withstood the passing of time, though like most rom-coms they don't lean into it heavily enough to make the movie as funny as it could've been. Until this movie I'd been very surprised that I liked all the Capra movies I'd seen as he was a conservative with values that aren't held by anyone but the villains in some of his movies; this one was the first I'd seen where Robert Riskin was the screenwriter and it made much more sense after that as Robert (a  big liberal) apparently wrote Frank's earliest successes and Frank repeated them later. Of particular note to me was how much better this movie was than the Best Picture winner from the year prior as that was one of my least-favorite movies of all time; this one being extremely good cements my opinion that Cavalcade just sucked and that it wasn't representative of this era of movies. Woohoo!"
58,it_happened_one_night,audience,5.0,p,"I felt like I was watching the mother of the films. This movie has been so influential to cinema is impossible to not like it.

70,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,"Through this acceptance of women's flaws, the most important message of the film becomes judgement is faulty, fleeting, and unsustainable, while love, even neglected and unfed, lives on for a lifetime."
71,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,Few of us have figured out how to upend over a century of defining and reinforcing what cinema is. Sciamma did it.
72,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,"Portrait of a Lady on Fire is set 260 years in the past, but the sentiments of its story are extremely modern. It's also as great, if not better, than any movie with a male focus, and continued proof that women's voices deserve to be heard."
73,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,"There is a joyful vivrancy about the film. They fully accept their fate, laid out by period and society. Yet they enjoy their few days together and remember it forever. It's super life affirming and uplifting, rather than sad."
74,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,"With gorgeous cinematography, [and] a beautiful script that shows off the French language at its very best...Céline Sciamma's new film is easily one of the best of the year."

77,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,"There are many great acting moments in this film, but you should especially savor the final shot, the long close-up of Haenel in profile. Put simply, it's why we go to the movies."
78,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,critics,fresh,p,"Metaphorical and melancholic, Céline Sciamma's masterpiece is a slow burn period romance that takes its time to draw you in. But once it does, there's no looking back."

81,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,audience,5.0,p,"Céline Sciamma creates a beautifully reminiscent masterpiece, with subtle but powerful performances, meaningful dialogue, and enthralling camera work. It praises simple, and patient filmmaking, that ends with an astoundingly profound finale."

86,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,audience,5.0,p,"What an amazing sapphic period piece. The film is an incredible portrayal of two beautifully complex characters who find themselves hesitant in admitting their feelings for one another.

The creative choices—like there being no male characters featured in the bulk of the movie—make this piece all the better. Portrait of a Lady of Fire is a must-watch."
87,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,audience,5.0,p,"Romance in its greatest splendor. Portraited it in a cinematography that every single shot can be a gorgeous painting. Every single aspect feels the most genuine and natural that I've ever seen in a love film; the acting, directing, script, cinematography and editing are summarized in a simple word, BEAUTY."
88,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,audience,5.0,p,"OH MY GOD, this movie. GORGEOUS. Just watch it. I don't even know what to say other than WATCH IT NOW."
89,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,audience,4.5,p,"Telling the story of an intoxicating affair between two 18th century women, Céline Sciamma directs Noémie Merlant and Adèle Haenel in this passionate drama. After premiering at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, the film went on to win the Queer Palm and Best Screenplay. The film also received nominations for nine César Awards and a BAFTA Film Award. 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire' also marks the third collaboration between Haenel and Sciamma, both previously working on the 2007 drama 'Water Lillies' and the short film 'Pauline'.

Set on an isolated island in Brittany, a young painter, Marianne (Noémie Merlant),  is tasked to paint a wedding portrait of Héloïse (Adèle Haenel) without her knowledge. Marianne must discreetly observe her model as she works under the illusion of companionship. But as feelings between the two women flourish, an ardent romance begins between the two women.

Shot in 7k, nearly every shot in the film resembles a painting. Claire Mathon makes sure none of the lighting comes off too harsh and does a splendid job of making the light seem natural in both exterior and interior shots. The smooth camera movements help immerse the viewer in the scene as the camera follows the character and the lack of cuts within these shots aids the audience in feeling like they're watching each sequence as it unfolds. Diegetic sound also plays a role in drawing in the viewer.  Mixed with the absence of a score, it helps the viewer to feel like they're right there with Marianne and Héloïse. Sciamma stated the reason the film lacks a score is so that viewers can be obsessed with the rhythm of each scene in both the body movements and the camera.

Throughout the film, both women each have a main outfit. Marianne wears a refined, red dress, a colour that directly opposes Héloïse's vibrant green dress. Both fabric-heavy garments are perfectly juxtapositioned in terms of colour and style; each representing the character's personality. As well as being shot in an 18th-century castle, the costumes emphasise the authenticity of the film. Noémie Merlant and Adèle Haenel both give incredible performances across the film. Luàna Bajrami gives a great performance as the housemaid whom Héloïse and Marianne help to get an abortion.

Sciamma does a great job bringing delicate themes to the forefront of 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire', including abortion and arranged marriage, both of which were issues that women faced in the 18th century. These sensitive themes are handled with care and aren't glorified by the director. The story of Orpheus and Eurydice also holds some importance to the story. For example, both women choose the memory of each other and when Marianne leaves Héloïse, Héloïse asks Marianne to turn around, like how Eurydice asks Orpheus to turn around. 

Something viewers might notice is the distinct lack of men in the film, the few scenes that feature male characters, they're either barely focused on or purposely have their back turned to the camera, supporting the fact that the film is a love letter to the female gaze. Sciamma doesn't oversexualize the relationship between these two women, and any nudity featured feels incredibly natural. Viewers will pick up on the suggestive imagery lightly scattered through the film, the most obvious one being the scene in which an armpit is made to look like a piece of the female anatomy.

Overall, 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire' is an erotic, sensual love story between two women in a short-lived affair. Sciamma brings viewers a story that delves into the exploration of love and its inevitable departure. Films that have a resemblance to 'POALOF', in terms of its central love story include the 2017 drama 'Disobediance' and Francis Lee's 2019 feature 'Ammonite'. Helmed by brilliant performances and artistic cinematography, the film is a visually stunning feature that spans over 120 minutes."

103,incredibles,critics,fresh,p,"These are lovely characters, it's a witty script, there's lots of laughs."
104,incredibles,critics,fresh,p,It is a simply astounding feat of animation with such attention paid to details like the lighting and even the hair of characters.
105,incredibles,critics,fresh,p,"A sharp, even amusing, homage to comic book lore, a great family-friendly action-comedy, and a thoughtful marital drama all wrapped up in a deliciously exciting package."
106,incredibles,critics,fresh,p,"As the kids discover their powers and this family hovers between super and dysfunctional, ""The Incredibles"" finds its voice . . . and it speaks to families everywhere."
107,incredibles,critics,fresh,p,Incredible and action-packed fun for the entire family.
108,incredibles,critics,fresh,p,This is an amazing movie.
109,incredibles,critics,fresh,p,"Assembled with an intense amount of care and love so that every cut, every sound, every movement, builds to a euphonious whole."
110,incredibles,audience,2.5,n,"Brad Bird strikes to me as the kind of man that could easily make a film, but not write one's story without a bit of help"
111,incredibles,audience,5.0,p,My favorite movie of all time.
112,incredibles,audience,4.0,p,"After superheroes have been outlawed, a family of supers must survive the patriarch's mid-life crisis. The director, Brad Bird, worked on 2D films before this and he and his team gave a unique 3D look to this film that works well. Graig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee all do great voice acting work. I can't imagine any other voices for these characters. The writing is also superb as they capture a great family dynamic while furthering the plot and allowing for action sequences. My only complaint is that I always remember this movie to be long and therefore hard to rewatch. Excellent movie, highly recommended."
113,incredibles,audience,4.5,p,"Great family film, taught me a lot about a man's limitations and straights when I was younger."
114,incredibles,audience,2.5,n,It's a bit too long for this kind of movie. It's pretty average. Some funny parts. Some fun animations. Okay concept. Nothing incredible.
115,incredibles,audience,4.0,p,Pixar was pumping out one hit after another in the early 2000's monsters Inc finding Nemo and now the incredibles arguably the best super hero movie ever the entire family has super powers and team up to defeat syndrome also the scene of Bob at work is one of the most adult moments in pixar and very relatable I think its safe to say that this movie is well... Incredible ;)
116,incredibles,audience,4.5,p,"Some of the animation did not age well, I´m not saying it was bad, but at some points you can tell that the movie was made in 2004. Also, a little more Frozone wouldn't have hurt. Other than that, The Incredibles is a masterpiece, and easily one of Pixar's best efforts. The action is amazing, the humor is great, the voice cast is solid, the plot is brilliant, the villain is awesome, and the music is hard-hitting. Overall, this movie is everything the Fantastic 4 movies should have been, and it definitely lives up to it's title."
117,incredibles,audience,4.0,p,"One of Pixar's more mature films with lots of details that I only picked up on years later, The Incredibles is another brilliant animated feature that continues to entertain years later."
118,incredibles,audience,4.5,p,LA ANIMACION AVECES MEDIO NEFASTA PERO ESO NO QUITA QUE LA PELI SEA EPICA
119,incredibles,audience,4.5,p,"Although it's not perfect, it's pretty near of it. An unforgettable scoresound and lesseon of family made this film essential in the animation. 9/10"
120,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"It's the greatest comedy - and funniest movie - of all time. ... But, as with most of Chaplin's other films, it'll also make you cry your eyes out."
121,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Several high spots stand out as notable examples of Chaplin's expert timing of slapstick burlesque, scenes that are apt to make the spectator shed tears from the strain of laughter."
122,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"The sequence in which the modern mechanical feeder for workers is introduced is a gem of comedy invention. It is one of the funniest episodes, and certainly the most ingenious."
123,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,There are reminders of every Chaplin picture that was ever made all through Modern Times and there are enough brand new comic inventions to explain why Charlie takes such a long time between pictures and why they are so superlatively worth waiting for.
124,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"What most amazes you about Modern Times, is the fact that, in this day of superfine sound films, it says everything without saying anything."
125,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"In many ways Modern Times is old-fashioned film comedy, but it is the kind of comedy which has made millions of people laugh all over the world and which has won Mr. Chaplin the great affection and love."
126,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"While he has borrowed a few symbolic touches from the Russian picture makers, there is nothing of real significance in Chaplin s work except his earnest desire, and his really great ability, to entertain."
127,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Modern Times, underneath its farce, is a curiously passionate jibe at the herd-instincts and herd clangour of a machine age."
128,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"The monotony of this Job ""gets"" Charlie and he runs wild, attacking everything and everybody in view with his brandished wrenches in one of the funniest scenes ever filmed."
129,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Miss Goddard put us in mind more of a ballet dancer in portraying her role than a screen player, which fits in, on the whole, rather well with Chaplin's style. She's attractive and has charm."
130,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"It is episodically hilarious but never consistently so, and you come away from the Penn remembering, not so much the heroic Chaplinesque figure as a nut-and-bolt factory, a red flag, a feeding machine and a song."
131,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"It doesn't seem possible to inject a large quantity of heart appeal in a heavily gagged-up comedy but Chaplin does it. That's Chaplin's forte, and that's what distinguishes his comedies from all others."
132,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,Chaplin exhibits his amazing versatility in the fast-forgotten art of pantomime and makes you laugh when you had perhaps expected to cry.
133,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Remaining silent, Charlie is more eloquent in pantomime than many other comedians are with the added use of spoken words. Poking gentle fun at mechanized industry, Charlie is comic indeed."
134,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Five years absence from the screen has not diminished Chaplin's art. In his usual fashion, he can provoke laughs or tears, and keep the audience absorbed in whatever he is doing."
135,modern_times,critics,rotten,n,"What begins as a rather heavy lampooning gets lost in a series of first-rate slapstick acts and ends up as an idyll. Modern Tunes is, of course, funny picture; it Is also a very disappointing one."
136,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Chaplin [has] returned to basic fundamentals in story construction, coupling with it an ironic poke or two at the System, as constituted today, and combined with that his great talent in his first screen appearance since City Lights."
137,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,There are many sequences which will become famous. The philosophy is evident. It is clear that Chaplin's answer to modern times is that if the individual does not conform he is taken away in a van to prison or to hospital.
138,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"The full revelation of [Paulette Goddard] is not to be detected in this production, but there is unusual promise in her work -- perhaps more than in the instance of any other Chaplin leading woman."
139,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,".Many of the situations are slapstick and many of a higher order, some quite amusing and a few hilarious."
140,modern_times,audience,1.0,n,20% rating. Didn't laugh as much as I wished.
141,modern_times,audience,5.0,p,esta película es totalmente divertida que te va a dejar escapar una risa
142,modern_times,audience,2.5,n,"I mean its typical Chaplin. I find his humor mostly predictable and the original annoying steve urkel. He is not really my cup of tea. In this day and age, I prefer more intellect with my humor, although this keeps you somewhat entertained. I liked seeing how the old department stores were organized and how police used to wander the streets. I also liked seeing the inappropriate coke scene and when they talk about ""darkies"" this people back in the day had no chill. Cant believe this is what people looked forward to for entertainment, the bar was not very high. This wasn't his best film I'm afraid and I don't like slapstick to begin with."
143,modern_times,audience,5.0,p,Chaplin Brings his slapstick comedy Genius to his Timeless as his beloved Character The Tramp and goes from Working in a factory to jail then to a waiter and the along the way the results are every time hilarious results in this Slient pre code masterpiece from one of the masters filmmakers of all time
144,modern_times,audience,4.0,p,"Class on precarious jobs and how to face it, more valid today than 85 years ago."
145,modern_times,audience,2.5,n,"I think it's safe to say that I'm just not a big fan of Charlie Chaplin. As of writing this review, I've seen The Great Dictator, City Lights and, earlier today, Modern Times. The latter is a noted criticism of industrialisation and its effect on humanity, but most of the film is, unsurprisingly, The Tramp spending long stretches of time falling over, bumping into things and being so gosh darned loveable that you just wanna pick him up and take him home. It felt like the least funny and least substantial of the 3 films, with a scattershot plot and sporadic social commentary. This might have been intentional, as this was to be The Tramp's final cinematic outing, and Chaplin wanted him to go out doing what he had become famous for. It does end on an organically positive note, and if Chaplin's style of comedy appeals to you, then Modern Times should be on your watchlist. But I wasn't won over by its message or its content."
146,modern_times,audience,5.0,p,I love Modern Times so much I came back for the second showing! See my earlier post.
147,modern_times,audience,5.0,p,"Charlie is mesmerizing. Modern Times is one of my favorite films. Its funny and poignant, a timeless classic as relevant today as it always was. This was the Little Tramps last appearance and Charlies last silent film. There is some dialogue as well as sound effects and a brilliant score but Charlie himself doesnt speak. We do hear his voice, however, at the end!"
148,modern_times,audience,5.0,p,Charlie Chapman's talents mesmerize.
149,modern_times,audience,4.5,p,"Modern Times is unexpectedly hilarous. Somehow the 30s humor still works. The story is related in a very good way, and the mix between sound and silence is just incredible.
Modern Times is one of the most important films in history, uniting silent and sound movies, but more important, it is a really good film."
150,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,An incredibly subtle example of cinematic virtuosity and poetry.
151,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,Watching this film provided me with three of the most spellbinding hours that I spent watching movies this year.
152,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,Moments bloom into radiant life.
153,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,"For a century and more, film directors have explored crosscurrents between art and life, and how one informs the other. Hamaguchi makes that exploration a fully humanized one."
154,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,Drive My Car is one of 2021's best films.
155,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,"The film firmly establishes its lonely and wounded characters, its melancholy tone, and its empathetic philosophy of the lost finding connections with each other."
156,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,"Slow to build and with an assembly of characters who are all more complex than they seem on the surface, Drive My Car exemplifies Japan's growing body of literary cinema."
157,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,"With Drive My Car, Ryûsuke Hamaguchi crafts an emotional epic. It's a road movie through the soul and an odyssey well worth taking. You'll feel transformed by the journey's end."
158,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,Hidetoshi Nishijima is spectacular in this film.
159,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,It's beautiful in every conceivable way.
160,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,"There is a deep richness to the film, especially in Yûsuke's emotional journey, and Hamaguchi does an excellent job of letting his characters' secrets unfold naturally."
161,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,It feels as expansive as the whole world.
162,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,"It feels like it moves at a clip even though, yes, it's at three hours. Very much worth a watch."
163,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,The characters' relationships and internal drama is the key to Drive my Car. [Full review in Spanish]
164,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,For many of us who may feel like we've stalled in our own great loss. Discovering Drive My Car may just give you the power to propel forward once more. A remarkable work that will stick with me for some time yet.
165,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,"Ambitious and yet quietly confident, Hamaguchi's film feels an absolute treat."
166,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,What begins as a shuttle between home and rehearsal spaces ends up taking the pair across Japan and on a journey through memory and loss.
167,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,Hidetoshi Shinomiya's cinematography makes a trip to the dump look poetic. The entire ensemble is remarkable.
168,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,"Drive My Car is a rich and wonderfully soothing work, a film that only further confirms Hamaguchi as one of the finest directors working today."
169,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,"Drive My Car is an evocative display of our capacity for empathy, our need for change, and the catharsis of art and creation."
170,drive_my_car,audience,3.5,p,"Drive My Car is a slow burning, subtle film about a man confronting and accepting paradoxical truths - his wife loved him, yet cheated on him. He is able to do this only through the power of fiction (i.e. not truth) through his acting on stage and being paired with a stoic driver. Through it all, they learn that life is messy and you just have to keep on living. Usually, these kinds of films go over my head a bit, and this did as well, still it was an interesting film to watch. I'm not sure I completely go it, but I was still very much engaged."
171,drive_my_car,audience,5.0,p,"I remembered reading the original story and this film nails it in a slow, sumptuous glory. The slightly-bright washed out colour palette, the red car, the sheer and wonderful mix of characters make it a great film to watch on so many levels: the cinematography, the acting, the storyline."
172,drive_my_car,audience,5.0,p,Great story. As a screenwriter I especially appreciated the bit about screenwriting while in the midst of sex. Awesome!
173,drive_my_car,audience,5.0,p,Drive My Car is a masterclass in writing that retains the spirit of Haruki Murakami's short story while taking some interesting original turns in the road.
174,drive_my_car,audience,4.0,p,"Maybe a little long in the tooth, Drive My Car is a excellent story about grief, self-acceptance and the struggles of letting go. Its performed outstandingly across the board, packed with a beautiful score and enough room to breathe."
175,drive_my_car,audience,2.5,n,"Waaay too long.  Interesting story, but couldn't they do it in less than three hours?"
176,drive_my_car,audience,4.0,p,"Started out on a seemingly distasteful note, then proceeded at a soporific face, but then, 20 minutes or so later, woke you up in a fell swoop and didn't let go, embodying pure magic of cinema and looking more original than any recent movie I could think of – up until the end where one ill-conceived, distracting, and unnecessary scene (the distant village in the snow) dispelled the magic and made you wish the film had ended a bit sooner. Still, head and shoulders above most new films of recent years."
177,drive_my_car,audience,4.0,p,"beautiful cinematography and a great adapted script, the film explores the diverse convictions of its characters, which leads to different dialogues. Because of that, it ends up becoming long and heavy, but it's an incredible 3 hours."
178,drive_my_car,audience,5.0,p,A Masterpiece unlike any other film!
179,drive_my_car,audience,5.0,p,"I loved this film, the story, the acting, the parts of Japan that made me want to go back . At no time did I feel restless- the ‘ride’ just felt smooth and seemed to fly by just like the main character described how her driving felt. I highly recommend this film though, if possible, brush up on your familiarity with Chekhov especially Uncle Vanya, before you see it."
180,1917_2019,critics,rotten,n,"We should be drawn into the personal story--director Sam Mendes loosely based the movie on his grandfather Alfred's wartime experiences--but instead, we're watching all the smoke and mirrors. It's sound and fury that could signify so much more."
181,1917_2019,critics,fresh,p,"What could have been a gimmick in the service of a weaker narrative becomes a masterstroke here, basically denying us any let-off from the tension of what is happening on the screen."
182,1917_2019,critics,fresh,p,It is a must-see.
183,1917_2019,critics,fresh,p,The gimmicky side of [its single take] fades juxtaposed to the perspective it offers.
184,1917_2019,critics,fresh,p,"In addition to Deakins, production designer Dennis Gassner and composer Thomas Newman also add layers of bravura artistry to create an experience that will leave you breathless, heart pounding and absolutely emotionally wrecked by the end."
185,1917_2019,critics,fresh,p,Mendes creates one of the best films released in 2019.
186,1917_2019,critics,fresh,p,Forget gushing quotes and star ratings. Probably the most effective way to advertise this movie is to strap heart rate monitors on viewers and put the results on the poster.
187,1917_2019,critics,fresh,p,"The filmmakers have taken a simple premise and gone with a ""less is more"" tactic. This allows for more focus on a beautifully shot film, and highlights the actors who give their all emotionally and physically."
188,1917_2019,critics,fresh,p,1917 can safely be added to the list of movies that have expanded and enhanced our understanding of how truly brutal war can be.
189,1917_2019,critics,fresh,p,"1917, under the talented hands of Sam Mendes, is one of the best war movies ever made and one of the best of 2019."
190,1917_2019,critics,fresh,p,This is a contemplative story of a mission and the men who sacrifice their own safety for the greater good. It highlights the ever-present danger of attack but it is the character's emotional journey that makes for a compelling story.
191,1917_2019,critics,fresh,p,"A measured compromise of its emotional quotient to create a visual feast, [1917] is undoubtedly impressive while remaining remote."
192,1917_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Sam Mende's quiet WWI epic 1917 is a cinematic masterpiece, a near perfect war film that appeals to even those of us who don't particularly enjoy war movies ... To put it even simpler, this film is bananas."
193,1917_2019,critics,rotten,n,"... [C]heck[s] the box that indicates war is, indeed, hell. But this is not the same as actually taking that truth seriously."
194,1917_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Despite the intermittent cinematographic interruptions to the nerve-wracking immersion in WWI chaos, the movie remains unwaveringly tense."
195,1917_2019,critics,fresh,p,Its visual artistry places it among the best historical war films of the past decade or two.
196,1917_2019,critics,fresh,p,"The film's final hour loses steam and is beset by more than a few narrative lapses it ultimately can't overcome. Still, this is a worthwhile epic best seen on the big screen."
197,1917_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Although it hardly goes beyond being technically bold, it still is quite admirable in its ambition."
198,1917_2019,critics,fresh,p,War is hell and Sam Mendes's hell is quiet and real and intimate and suspenseful and you feel it in your bones long after you leave the theatre.
199,1917_2019,critics,rotten,n,"At this current level of Hollywood production, expressionistic British militarism is all the same to me and it's worn me out..."
200,1917_2019,audience,5.0,p,Roger Deakins. What else do you want.
201,1917_2019,audience,5.0,p,It is beyond-language-kind-of awesome. Touched by literally every scene.
202,1917_2019,audience,5.0,p,Utterly captivating in every single way from start to finish. A simple story told well is an art form all of its own and 1917 just raised the bar!
203,1917_2019,audience,4.5,p,"One of the best war movies I've seen. Amazing cinematography, amazing score. Fucking love the way this movie was shot.
Emotinal, tense, disturbing, beautiful, glorious are some of the adjectives i could use to describe this movie.
The scene where George Mackay gets off the trenches and starts running in the middle of the field in order to deliver the message to Colonel Mckenzie is just pure gold.
2019 was definitely one of the best years in film history."
204,1917_2019,audience,5.0,p,"It's a difficult thing, to capture a moment in time, especially when it's filmed long take, but 1917 absolutely nails it! Never would I want to be subject to WWI, but I am eternally grateful that this film has allowed me to experience it for the briefest of moments. I cannot spot a single thing wrong with it, and it belongs on the Mount Rushmore of war films."
205,1917_2019,audience,4.5,p,"This is not only a great war movie and a great film overall, it is one of the best war movies I have ever seen. My God, the camera work/shots in this movie are so well executed from beginning to end and the journey of one man navigating across so many obstacles put in his way is pristine and invigorating. Directors should take notes, THIS is why I love films and analyzing filmmaking."
206,1917_2019,audience,5.0,p,"(Spoilers included) Absolutely one of the best movies I've ever seen. The acting is first rate, the situation is quite realistic. The cinematography matched beautifully with the musical score and was at times breathtaking (the burning city), at other times dreadful (in the sense that it conveyed the horrors of war,, crawling over the bodies). The a capella song towards the end brought tears to my eyes, as did when the main character delivered the news of his friend's death to his brother.  This movie hit every single mark I have for a great movie, and it actually gets better with each viewing. I watched it three times in the theater before COVID shut down the venues, and would go to a theater showing today if it were available. Speaking as a former soldier, I believe this also one of the best war movies I've ever seen. It should have beaten out Parasite for best film of the year."
207,1917_2019,audience,5.0,p,"The greatest, most tense war movie of all time directed fantastically by Sam Mendes, and the cinematography is some of the greatest of all time."
208,1917_2019,audience,5.0,p,"Excelente película, una sorpresa para mi ya que no me suelen gustar este tipo de peliculas sobre guerra, ya que me suelen aburrir. Esta película, para empezar, tiene un buen ritmo; toda la premisa de la película se presenta en los primeros 5 minutos y comienza a partir de ahí. No es frenética, pero da una sensación real de primera persona y de que estás haciendo el viaje con el protagonista. Yo creo que lo que mas se destaca de la película es su hermosa cinematografía y paisajes asombrosos. También destaca el trabajo de cámara por parte de Sam Mendes, que hace un trabajo excepcional dando la sensación de que la película esta filmada toda en una sola toma, y eso esta implementado de una manera tremenda. Las actuaciones son muy buenas y realistas, destaco principalmente a George MacKay, aunque todo el reparto es perfecto. Además, la música y todo el sonido en general de la película es sobresaliente. Por otro lado, estuve entretenido durante toda la película; raro ya que este tipo de historias me suelen aburrir. Hay algunas pausas en la trama que le permiten al espectador recuperar el aliento. Finalmente, no me di cuenta del tiempo que pasaba con esta película, me quede con ganas de ver mucho mas. En conclusión, creo que es una obra maestra del genero bélico que logra cautivarte a través de su historia y de sus audiovisuales. Muy recomendada."
209,1917_2019,audience,3.5,p,"Not bad, not great either."
0,finding_nemo,critics,fresh,p,Easily Pixar's most colorful and joyous movie.
1,finding_nemo,critics,fresh,p,"Finding Nemo teaches the classic Pixar/Disney lessons about the importance of family, acceptance, kindness, and love, but it also an exciting tale of adventure, overcoming adversity, and teamwork."
2,finding_nemo,critics,fresh,p,"In its story, characters, and visuals, Finding Nemo reminds us of how remarkable- and poignant- a well made family film can be."
3,finding_nemo,critics,fresh,p,"The visuals are as sharp as the scripting, succeeding with laughs, thrills, heartache, and unforgettable characterizations to craft an animated masterpiece."
4,finding_nemo,critics,fresh,p,"Compared to other Pixar films, this may not be as good as the Toy Story franchise, but it's awfully close."
5,finding_nemo,critics,fresh,p,"A family film that is truly for the whole family - from grandpop to grandson. Finding Nemo is a precious gem in the Pixar and Disney vaults. Exquisitely stunning, enchanting and magical from start to finish."
6,finding_nemo,critics,fresh,p,It's downright curmudgeonly to remain focused on the negatives when the rest of the picture is saturated with invention and wit.
7,finding_nemo,critics,fresh,p,Pixar really knocked it out of the park on this one.
8,finding_nemo,critics,fresh,p,"Most of all, Finding Nemo is a touching tale which reassures you that even though things may look bleak, it will all turn out well in the end."
9,finding_nemo,critics,fresh,p,"Finding Nemo offers as much in terms of thrills, frights, humour and psychological insight as it does in pure technical skill, proving that a movie can be art without being an ""art"" movie."
10,finding_nemo,critics,fresh,p,This gem of a film is the one with which Pixar asserted their supremacy over the animated world.
11,finding_nemo,critics,fresh,p,...a good-but-hardly-great animated endeavor from Pixar.
12,finding_nemo,critics,fresh,p,"Finding Nemo is ultimately a rewarding, engaging, compelling, and even spiritual adventure that works charismatically on multiple levels."
13,finding_nemo,critics,fresh,p,"It looks great, of course: All the Pixar movies do. But the genius of those other movies lay in their actual stories -- stories as inspired as the animation."
14,finding_nemo,critics,fresh,p,Beautiful.
15,finding_nemo,critics,fresh,p,"Visually, Finding Nemo is spectacular. The animators render theses scenes with exquisite detail and vibrant color, reaching beyond mere CGI-wizardry to artistry."
16,finding_nemo,critics,fresh,p,A beguiling piece of storytelling and creates a magical underwater world through its imaginative graphics and sound effects.
17,finding_nemo,critics,fresh,p,"Artistically, it's up there with the all-time animated greats."
18,finding_nemo,critics,fresh,p,A splendid eco-friendly comedy set in the Great Barrier Reef.
19,finding_nemo,critics,fresh,p,"The animation in Finding Nemo is quite breathtaking and this movie, created by Pixar, the same outfit that made Toy Story, looks like The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau."
20,finding_nemo,audience,5.0,p,"Must-see! One of the greatest Pixar films of all time, deserves the 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. This is an excellent Movie that has such a beautiful story fit for all ages."

22,finding_nemo,audience,4.0,p,"still love this one, dory it's my favorite"
23,finding_nemo,audience,4.0,p,Finding nemo is a great movie from my child hood. I recently rewatched it and saw how much is has related to family life and single fathers. It also plays a role in showing step families with dory too. Overall a great movie with good lessons in it.
24,finding_nemo,audience,5.0,p,"A classic Disney movie that is worth the watch. This movie is child friendly with slight hidden adult humor. Finding Nemo focuses on a lost son with an overprotective single father. It shows that having helicopter parents can lead to defiant kids. The is a must see for parents and children with a take home message to not be defiant and not to have over protective parents. Not only is the movie sentimental and emotion, it is funny and will have you quoting the film for the rest of the week."
25,finding_nemo,audience,4.0,p,"A young clownfish named Nemo is taken by humans and his father, Marlin, transferces the ocean to find him, with a little help from a regal blue tang named Dory. This is a great film! The first two scenes do a great job to endear you to both Marlin and Nemo. Dory is instantly likable and relatable. As Marlin goes on his journey and develops his character, the characters he meets are all memorable and iconic. The aquarium crew are all memorable as well. The animation is top notch and really captures the underwater environment in a believable way. Ellen DeGeneres stands out in the voice acting department, by creating a unique and memorable character in Dory. One of the best films Pixar has done, highly recommended!"

27,finding_nemo,audience,5.0,p,One of pixars best movies ever it might even top toy story this film tells a great story and has a large cast of colorful characters the sharks are awesome Ellen Degeneres gives a hilarious performance as Dory it is sure to provide entertainment for the whole family

31,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Director Florian Zeller makes light work of this adaption of his play, using the camera to recreate the claustrophobia and uncertainty of relying on an uncertain mind."
32,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Anthony Hopkins is one of the best actors alive right now, undoubtedly. The Father was one of the best surprises of 2020, with an incredible visual concept that blows my mind when I think this is Zeller's first film. [Full review in Spanish]"
33,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"[Much] of the strength of the film lies in Anthony Hopkins' lead performance alongside Olivia Colman, Zeller's direction is nothing to sniff at."

36,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,The film seamlessly blends genuine fear with overwhelming sadness.
37,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Hopkins...has never been better. And, given his much garlanded career, that really is saying something."
38,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Watching The Father feels like watching a particularly good episode of Black Mirror, without any of the tech paranoia."

40,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"The word ""devastating"" is used so much as to be almost devalued. But, in its truest, most powerful sense, The Father is devastating."
41,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"There is no gawdy tricks, nor leaning on tropes. From start to finish The Father is exactly what you see it as. Confusing, scary, loving, and sad."
42,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"It has an exceptional script, and not only because of the dialogues' quality, but because it plays with what the viewer sees and understands. [Full review in Spanish]"
43,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"[Anthony Hopkins] is absolutely remarkable here. I read the screenplay, available online, out of curiosity, and what he brings to the words on the page is beyond and beyond and beyond. Hopkins has played King Lear (twice) but this is his real King Lear."
44,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"The way Zeller and his production designer Peter Francis orchestrate these changes are almost imperceptible, but nevertheless disorienting and utterly crucial to the narrative."
45,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,Watching two great performers together provides The Father's highpoint.
46,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Without resorting to exploitative, amped-up mystery or obfuscation, Zeller and co-writer Christopher Hampton have fashioned a sort of gaslight thriller in which the mind is both predator and prey."
47,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Zeller has delivered not only the best film adaptation of the season, but one of the most effective, moving and, dare I say, cinematic films of the year."
48,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,Yet The Father is a powerful debut. The mood of isolation with its warped sense of time and the distanced characters confined to their homes: this film reflects our present moment without labouring the point home or making the obvious analogies.
49,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"This is a film of immeasurable power which everyone should experience once. It explores the frailties of being human, in a society which increasingly values youth over experience."
50,the_father_2021,audience,4.0,p,"A stellar acting from Anthony Hopkins and Olivier Coleman. The movie is in the perspective of the lead character ‘Anthony’ who is suffering from dementia. The main actor (Hopkins) perfectly depicts what a person goes through/feels when they are subjected to dementia. While watching the movie, viewers would also have hard time separating the reality (present) and memories (past) of Anthony as he mixes both of them up."
51,the_father_2021,audience,4.0,p,"A good movie, but the other one with Viggo Mortenson is more gritty and real - Falling"
52,the_father_2021,audience,4.5,p,"Hopkins has never been better than this, playing a fragile man fallen apart though dementia, The Father is a devastating look at what people go though entirely alone, even if they have people around them."
53,the_father_2021,audience,5.0,p,"Honestly one of the greatest movies I've seen. You experience what someone with Alzheimer's goes through on a daily basis. The cast was spectacular, Anthony Hopkins gives an amazing performance throughout the film you feel as if he actually has the disease. Truly a great film and does its job at spreading awareness."
54,the_father_2021,audience,5.0,p,Visually stunning. Clean work right here.
55,the_father_2021,audience,2.5,n,"An accurate yet depressing look at life as one gets old and loses touch with reality. Troubling look at the beauty of family commitment and the toll it takes on the loved ones. Not sure it is worth watching, unless you like sadness and emotional pain."
56,the_father_2021,audience,5.0,p,Fabulously sad. I almost walked out with PTSD - my Dad went through this with his own father - the parallels were scary!
57,the_father_2021,audience,2.0,n,"Talk about a true head spin, the setup felt like it should be there, but the camera work, and the circling dialogue, just put your head in a blender and hit the extreme button on the end of the machine."
58,the_father_2021,audience,5.0,p,Immersive and heartbreaking to say the least.

80,promising_young_woman,audience,4.0,p,"Pretty good, but cheesy at times"
81,promising_young_woman,audience,5.0,p,"The movie Promising Young Women, directed by Emerald Fennel in 2020, starred Carey Mulligan & Bo Burnham. Is about Cassie a empowered feminist women getting revenge on men who took advantage of her best friend while she was drunk. She makes men feel morally wrong for taking advantage of vulnerable women who are blackout drunk, but she acts to be drunk at bars to then trick the men that go after her, and threatens them to not go after women who are drunk just to have sex with them. But her main goal was to go after the guys who raped her best frined by linking up with her past ""friends"" and she blackmails and manipulates people into giving in and feeling guilt for what they did and not speaking up about it.

One aspect that stood out to me would be the music and lighting. Because the music supported the emotions and actions that were going on in the scenes. Especially when she confronts the people that she is looking for and targeting.

I feel like the movie was well made overall and it can seem sort of dark at times. But its a very solid movie that shows the intentions of men that see vulnerable women as a thing they can exploit for their own pleasure. Which happens in the real world and many get away with it because there's no ""proof"" so to say, And I would recommend this to other people of age to watch it because the movie is constantly making you guess what's going to happen next with unexpected turn of events."
82,promising_young_woman,audience,3.5,p,"Let me start by saying trigger warning as this film contains difficult subjects such as rape and assault. The film is dark and unique (sick at times).  Major parts of the plot is predictable, yet an entertaining thriller that will have you wondering how it'll all end."
83,promising_young_woman,audience,5.0,p,"Wow! This movie is absolutely astonishing with surprising plot twists and suspense that makes it hard to breathe. The music is the kicker here. This is by far the most creative use of pop songs in a movie I have ever heard and it just adds another layer of perfection to it. On top of that, the movie is about an important issue and makes you think long after you finished watching it."
84,promising_young_woman,audience,4.5,p,"Promising Young Women is a thriller/comedy directed by Emerald Fennell in 2020. This film stars Carey Mulligan, Bo Burnham, Alison Brie, and Clancey Brown. Promising Young Women takes place in suburban Ohio. Cassie Thomas who is played by Carey Mulligan was a medical student. She dropped out of medical school and she worked at a coffee shop after. She dropped out to comfort her best friend, Nina. Nina was also a medical student, but she was raped by a fellow colleague. No one believed Nina's story of rape, except Cassie. Nina eventually fell into a depression and this led to her death, suicide. Nina's death traumatized Cassie. This caused the beginning of Cassie's revenge story where she would go to bars alone, act drunk, and then she would lure men to see if they would take advantage of her. That is where everything all began.
	One thing that stood out to me was how the medical students Ryan and Al both knew that they did wrong, but they made the excuse that they were ""just kids"". Al raped Nina while she was drunk and passed out. Ryan took part in the assault by watching and he recorded everything when he had the power to stop it. They were both grown men with successful medical practices, but they both acted like they should have been exempt from all the trauma that they caused since they were ""just kids"". 
I really liked the film, Promising Young Women because the director, Emerald Fennell, did a good job of keeping the audience guessing. There were many plot twists throughout the film. I really believed that Bo Burnham's character, Ryan, was going to change Cassie for the better. I thought that her nights of going out to bars and acting drunk were going to come to an end because of him. He really liked her and she started to like him as well, but everything was ruined when Cassie found out that he was involved in Nina's assault. This really surprised me because I thought he was good. I really liked how throughout the film I could not tell if Cassie was depressed or actually psychotic. The quality of the movie was good, the lighting was different from all the other films that I have watched. I would recommend this movie to young viewers like myself because it shows a very serious topic in a somewhat comedic way. I would give this film 4.5/5 stars."
85,promising_young_woman,audience,3.5,p,"It's a good story, just a bit heavy handed.
But it's definitely watchable."
86,promising_young_woman,audience,5.0,p,I was very impressed by this movie. It's a very entertaining and thought provoking film. My congratulations to Emerald Fennell and the cast for a movie well done.
87,promising_young_woman,audience,4.0,p,Love the concept! The movie was great. Didn't get five because the ending was kinda weird not what you were expecting.
88,promising_young_woman,audience,4.5,p,"Interesting, great performances and thrilling to the end."
89,promising_young_woman,audience,4.0,p,"What goes around comes around.  An obsession never ends well.  Carey is on a quest to right a wrong from her friend and her past.  The men and the women who laughed at a girl being drugged drunk, raped and beaten are sick, beyond sick.  Girls watch it and alcohol ALWAYS clouds the picture and you hope you have a nice guy.  I took several drunken girls home in my time and believe me I could of but what I could not do afterward would be to live with myself if I did.  However, how many guys and women could???"
90,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"I can't think of an American-made film that stands up to multiple viewings quite like 'Kane'...it never feels like Welles and company are showing off, just showing what a movie can do."
91,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,Welles is the most exciting thing that's happened since sound.
92,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"I particularly like the structure of the film, especially the use of the news reel footage and the newspaper headlines to move the plot forward."
93,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,We aren't going to quibble about the genius business. Time will take care of that and if Welles goes down in history as one well be happy to have been among those who enjoyed the results of his great talent.
94,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,The sheer brilliance and audacity of Citizen Kane... make the film the most astounding cinematic achievement of the season. It ranks with Disney's Fantasia as a milestone in motion picture technique.
95,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"Citizen Kane Is a triumph not only for Orson Welles, but for his entire company as well."
96,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"Everything that Welles has to say in his capacity of author, actor and director is individual and striking. The grouping of the characters, the odd camera angles, the revealing little character glimpses are all superb."
97,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"Whether the story of Charles Foster Kane is a biography of one man or a composite of many, as Orson Welles claims, matters not so much as the fact that here we have a completely new approach to film biography."
98,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"[It] is my opinion that Mr. Welles has been sympathetic and kind. He reveals great respect for people, and a knowledge of their powers and talents."
99,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"It is daring, different, thrilling and revolutionary, a power play of startling brilliance."
100,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"This first screen effort of Orson Welles is of such vast difference to other pictures, in subject material, in treatment, in technique, in cast and in performance that the best advice perhaps is, ""See what you think."""
101,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,Welles has grasped the art of the photoplay in a single venture. He has accomplished in one picture what Hollywood veterans have been aiming at tor years.
102,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"I would say it is a great picture but... It is one of those things, like the Pyramids, which are impressive and definitely interesting to have seen, but one can have more fun than looking at the Pyramids."
103,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"In [Citizen Kane] Welles is revealed as having absorbed a tremendous amount of the tricks and tradition of the theater, and still more, that he possesses the skill and craftsmanship to adapt such knowledge to motion pictures in a masterful way."
104,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"[Orson Welles] has done a remarkable job of producing something different from the ordinary run of film fare, and in doing so has brought a number of new faces to the screen, besides appearing in the title roll himself."
105,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"Mr. Welles evolves by slow, precise degrees from the' ebullient, idealistic young man out to remold the world by the power of his inherited wealth, to a grim, petty tyrant without illusions, clinging tenaciously to a life which holds little for him."
106,citizen_kane,critics,rotten,n,"It's interesting. It's different. In fact, it's bizarre enough to become a museum piece. But its sacrifice of simplicity to eccentricity robs it of distinction and general entertainment."
107,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"To my way of thinking, Gregg Toland, the photographer, has accomplished the best job ever turned out by a camera."
108,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,I saw Citizen Kane months ago and it sticks in my mind almost as vividly as if I had seen it yesterday. And I shall certainly see it again.
109,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"The performances are of the finest, attuned perfectly to the production technique employed, although, besides Welles, the names are unknown to the average motion picture audience."
110,citizen_kane,audience,5.0,p,"One of the greatest films of all times, too bad most people now days have missed seeing this gem."
111,citizen_kane,audience,5.0,p,I've watched this movie probably 10 times. I enjoyed it every time.
112,citizen_kane,audience,5.0,p,"Kids who watch this movie will never know how revolutionary it was.  Every one if its dozens of innovations, from flashback structure to the use of sets with ceilings for additional authenticity, has become standard.  No problem-- there is time enough for them to study these aspects of Citizen Kane's brilliance if they decide to learn more about film history and criticism.  For their first viewing of this brilliant work just let them focus on the story, the dialogue, and the characters, which remain as compelling and contemporary as they were 70 years ago.

Like Willie Stark, Kane begins as a populist and dies corrupt and alone, and we can't help but hope for some explanation of how that happened, as Thompson does.  Both Kane and Stark were based on real-life figures.  Kane was based largely but not completely on William Randolph Hearst, the almost impossibly wealthy heir to the largest gold and silver mine owner in America, who became a powerful publishing magnate.  Kane might also have been based on Welles. himself, only 25 years old when he co-wrote, directed, and starred in this, his first film.  He spent the rest of his life coming up with one excuse or another for why he never came close to that level of achievement again."
113,citizen_kane,audience,5.0,p,The perfect foundation on so many levels of how movies would be made forevermore.
114,citizen_kane,audience,4.0,p,"It's earned its place in film history with its masterful use of lighting, framing, effects and revolutionary story structure but it has turned into something more of a symbol of a masterpiece rather than being the greatest film ever made. It's still miles better than the first Suicide Squad movie though."
115,citizen_kane,audience,0.5,n,it is just that is old and bad(what if i think i like that?)
116,citizen_kane,audience,4.5,p,"So I finally found a way to watch this after having the end ruined for me many years ago by a big mouthed brother of mine before I'd even seen this.  It'd probably have been ruined for my be the internet if my brother had never opened his fat mouth but I digress and am not going to divulge how I finally found a way to see it from a firsthand perspective.

While surprisingly bold, captivating, and entertaining for a film made 80 years ago it still has some spots of a slow and boring nature despite it's technical mastery and innovation"
117,citizen_kane,audience,5.0,p,"The film that revolutionized filmmaking, a name that has become synonymous with magnum opus — a true masterpiece — Citizen Kane is the film student's film for a reason. Yes, I had viewed many YouTube videos about Citizen Kane before ever watching the film, but that didn't take away from the enjoyment; I had actually completely forgotten what ""Rosebud"" meant anyway. Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) is on his deathbed in the palatial Xanadu when he murmurs ""Rosebud"" before expiring. Discovering what this American Titan's last word actually meant propels the film, if only superficially. Welles — who is also the (25 year old!) director — lays it all out in a news-breaking montage of Kane's life, the peaks and valleys, before seeing him as a child playing in the snow. We pretty much know everything that happens 15 minutes-in, now we get to fill in the gaps. Kane is ahead of his time as the newspaper mogul (think Ted Turner, Rupert Murdoch today) who, on day one of taking over The Inquirer, states: ""News is 24 hours"". Thus, changing the way the city — and eventually, the nation — learned about the world, especially considering he filled those pages with the filth we gobble up like a smorgasbord today. Considered a communist to some, a fascist to others (how topical), Kane engages in many of the activities you'd expect a super-wealthy businessman to engage in — expands his empire, ends friendships, ends marriages, begins new marriages, and builds a palace down in Florida with the biggest fuck-off fireplace I've ever seen. Considered a composite character, your opinion on Kane is probably justified and misguided.. That's to say, he's neither hero nor villain. Although Welles didn't necessarily invent many of the shots in his film, he absolutely changed the director's efficacy in storytelling, with too many to count here. A few include: the shot of Kane's parents (Agnes Morehead & Harry Shannon) with the banker (George Coulouris) who becomes his legal guardian as young Kane (Buddy Swan) is playing in the snow, Kane giving a political speech — the most recognizable scene of the film — with a gigantic poster of himself in the background, and the final shot of all the crates housing his treasures. ""One word can't explain a man's life."" Our powerful departing words. Oh, and what is ""Rosebud""? Eh, watch the film to find out. If anything, to pay homage to that gif you probably (sarcastically) use all the time."
118,citizen_kane,audience,2.0,n,"I was shocked to discover I didn't enjoy this film given its notoriously large reputation for being perhaps one of the best. I suppose it must just be a matter of taste, but I fail to see the appeal. I found it to be dry and not having much to say as a film. I didn't find the plot particularly gripping, the characters particularly inspiring, or the performances particularly outstanding. The best way I can describe it is there clearly is an element of Citizen Kane I fail to appreciate that others often do, but I fail to see what that element is."
119,citizen_kane,audience,4.0,p,It was an amazing film but not something i would call the greatest of all time

122,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Lulu Wang's The Farewell is a particularly articulate piece of filmmaking. It beautifully captures the sense of alienation of a child of two cultures, and finds warmth and humour in little family moments."
123,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Lulu Wang's The Farewell is bittersweet in the truest sense of the word, balancing on the knife edge of grief and joy."
124,the_farewell_2019,critics,rotten,n,"The movie wants you to believe that there are no easy answers [...] But unfortunately, there are easy answers here, and The Farewell did not do a good enough job of convincing me that this lie was necessary or ethical."
125,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"No matter where you come from, you'll likely find some point of connection with The Farewell. The film's themes of love and loss resonate far beyond its Chinese location, thanks to a talented cast and deft writing and directing."

127,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,It is remarkable that Wang created this film...steeped in Chinese and Chinese-American culture and yet has a message so strong that it can appeal to wide audiences.
128,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"A slow burn, a movie that builds to a poignant climax that not only feels earned but deserved."
129,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"A profound meditation on young vs. old and East vs. West, [The Farewell] looks to bridge a generational and cultural divide...through reconciliation and understanding."
130,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"It is exactly what it is, unapologetically. A funny, sweet, heart-felt, heart-wrenching film about family, identity, love and loss."
131,the_farewell_2019,critics,rotten,n,"Such an average, uneventful, small, intimately-designed, down-to-earth, slice-of-life drama that very little of it is memorable."

133,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"As authentic and involving as a family drama could hope to be, and one of the most effective takes on the tension between culture and identity seen in the last few years"
134,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,The Farewell packs a powerful emotional punch while still offering plenty of humor to give it some levity.
135,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Wang has produced an utter marvel of a film. The Farewell is a beautiful, resonating gem, fuelled by some standout performances and told with touches of pure grace."
136,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"It's about watching, about waiting. It's when it's at its most natural that The Farewell connects the inside and the outside with an honesty that's hard to resist."
137,the_farewell_2019,critics,rotten,n,"The second film as director of Lulu Wang doesn't move me nor does it seem funny, but I can't deny that it contains a certain intimacy with the intercultural treaty that describes the vicissitudes of a Chinese family. [Full review in Spanish]"

The premise of the story is very interesting, but it was mostly sub-titled Mandarin spoken language AND (more importantly) most of the sub-titles were white text on a white or light background. No English overdub available.  Impossible to comprehend the dialogue and story."
142,the_farewell_2019,audience,4.5,p,This is an impressive debut by Wang! This was a beautiful story of cultural identity and family ties. It's great to see Awkwafina show off her acting skills in this heartwarming drama.
143,the_farewell_2019,audience,4.5,p,"A poignantly told story based on a real lie, moving, ridiculous, hilarious, sad, an emotional rollercoaster. Great movie making."
144,the_farewell_2019,audience,5.0,p,reality that happens a lot in a family. from this I know that a sound mind will save man. Simple but beautiful story
145,the_farewell_2019,audience,3.5,p,"Summary: Billi scrapes up the money to fly to China in order to say goodbye to her dying grandmother. Based on a true lie, the grandmother turns out to be the only family member that doesn't know she's ill. 

Takeaways: This movie amplifies the American-Chinese cross-cultural experience. Come along for family conflicts, a fake wedding scheme, and moral dilemmas."
146,the_farewell_2019,audience,1.0,n,i dont even know why its called The farewell when its just chineese
147,the_farewell_2019,audience,3.5,p,"It makes you laugh, it makes you cry and it has an interesting plotline.  What more could you ask for.  The dialogue is superb and it makes you feel like you're listening to real conversations."
148,the_farewell_2019,audience,3.5,p,It's worth a watch but a little overrated. It is great that Hollywood is making movies of diversity and different cultures. Some of the writing just feels a little forced.
149,the_farewell_2019,audience,5.0,p,"This family comedy drama, directed by Lulu Wang, features one of the most powerful and beautiful endings in the recent years, which is by itself enough for the recommendation. Add to this story a big family gathering, whose members are facing the possibility of losing their loving matriarch and you'll get a universally relatable picture, in this case painted in Chinese American colors. Central part of the movie belongs to the touching relationship between grandma and granddaughter, masterfully played by Shuzhen Zhao and Awkwafina."
150,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,critics,fresh,p,The Wizard of Oz has been filmed with imagination. It has warmth and understanding of child psychology; it has gentle humor and a sturdy philosophical undercurrent. [It is] a rare and distinguished film that should capture the hearts of all ages.
151,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,critics,fresh,p,All these adventures are interestingly and charmingly depicted and sometimes you wish you were in this dreamland yourself.
152,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,critics,fresh,p,"Breathtakingly lovely sets, lighting, costumes, make-up and musical scores more than fulfill expectations, making the play an even note satisfactory adaptation of the book than was Goodbye Mr. Chips."
153,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,critics,fresh,p,"Caught la the relentless clutch of a Kansas Cyclone, Dorothy's whirlwind excursion into a world peopled by witches, fairies, Winkles, Munchkins and other quaint folk provides swift and exhilarating adventure."
154,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,critics,fresh,p,"If The Wizard of Oz, taken from the American fairy story by Frank Baum, carries to its adult audience the theme of conquest of fear, it could scarcely have been released to the world at a more propitious hour."
155,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,critics,fresh,p,"One cannot say that this is a rival to Disney, but it is as near to fantasy as one can get with human actors... I am under the spell of Oz."
156,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,critics,fresh,p,"Of gossamer weave and rainbow tints is this technicolor excursion into the never-never land that has come to the [screen] -- unreal, scarcely even to be imagined, yet persuading somehow that reality can be left behind without regret."
157,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,critics,fresh,p,"Audiences will fall under the spell of The Wizard of Oz just as does Dorothy, the heroine of this story, when a Kansas tornado blows her into the wonderful land of Oz. Remarkable technical effects and beautiful photography create an air of sheer magic."
158,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,critics,fresh,p,"The world of yesterday's, and perhaps tomorrow's, dreams created decades ago in the imagination of Frank L. Baum comes to the screen as a triumph of the movie camera in the realm of fantasy."
159,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,critics,fresh,p,"Despite its shortcomings, The Wizard of Oz is a spectacle to be seen -- a fantastic romp that will be a treat for the youngsters and a welcome diversion for their oldsters."
160,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,critics,fresh,p,"Judy Garland takes the farm-kid Dorothy as a natural, and adds three hit songs. Bert Lahr's Cowardly Lion has the gusty verve of a Bowery comedian. Dancer Ray Bolster invests the Scarecrow with a lunatic charm."
161,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,critics,fresh,p,"Young 'and old will appreciate The Wizard of Oz. I think, however, they would enjoy it more if the action had been speeded up a trifle. Nevertheless, it will be one of the season's talked about offerings and you should see it."
162,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,critics,fresh,p,"Judy Garland as Dorothy and Frank Morgan as the Wizard are the most favored players and do flawless work, but the delight of many persons will be Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion."
163,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,critics,fresh,p,"The Wizard of Oz is an exciting tour de force that keeps the eye and ear constantly occupied, bothers the brain very little. It is hearty and unsubtle, generous and sometimes, in its high riot, intoxicating."
164,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,critics,fresh,p,"The Wizard of Oz will, beyond question, be accorded recognition as a milestone in motion picture history."
165,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,critics,fresh,p,"As a children's movie, this is the definitive classic and does possess a magic all its own."
166,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,critics,fresh,p,"It is, of course, a ""must"" for the juveniles, and they will have a high old time. This is a real fairy tale, brought to the screen with all the trappings, colour, and wondrous charm of the printed word that has kept many a youngster late for dinner."
167,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,critics,fresh,p,"Victor Fleming has made, with living people this time, the most delightful film of its kind since Disney's Snow White."
168,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,critics,fresh,p,"The Wizard of Oz is an all-family picture, with all the charm of Baum's delightful book. But the story has an adult-appeal in plot, with cleverness in lines and situations, and lilting lyrics to delight all from 3 to 103."
169,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,critics,fresh,p,"The greater scope of the screen has allowed vastly more latitude in the presentation than is possible on the stage, and with a cast of popular and capable players The Wizard of Oz is one of the season's finest attractions."
170,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,audience,4.0,p,One of the Classics. Must watch movie. One of my favorite oldies.
171,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,audience,3.0,p,60% rating. Who hasn't seen this film?
172,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,audience,4.5,p,"Even 70 years after its release, director Victor Fleming's film is obviously a masterpiece of early film.  Not only does it have one of the most iconic female roles and one of the finest examples of the hero's journey, which influenced movies like Star Wars and Harry Potter, but it is also an amazing combination of drama, adventure, fantasy, and musical.  This is one of the rare movie phenomena that modern day grandparents can remember seeing as children, and that nostalgia can be easily shared with another generation of children who can now watch it in high definition.  It's a testament to the movie's universal appeal seven decades later, the Wizard of Oz is culturally significant, from Halloween costumes to sing along shows to remixes of, ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow.""

Garland, who was only 16 when Oz was filmed, is inimitably sublime as Dorothy, especially when she sings.  Although contemporary moviegoers are used to the precocious young, ""triple threats,"" marketed by Disney and Nickelodeon, Garland stands out as one of the first.  Garland's impressively mature voice soars beyond the rainbow and into audiences' hearts.  Beyond Dorothy, there's the amazing trifecta of theater trained actors who played her yellow brick road companions.  Hamilton is delightfully evil as the green-skinned witch, and Burke is memorably comforting as the good witch Glinda.  Everyone should see the Wizard of Oz multiple times in their lives; it's simply a must see film."
173,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,audience,5.0,p,A timeless classic onto himself for generations to come
174,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,audience,5.0,p,"I heard alot about this movie and today I finally watched it.  What to say, I didn't expect that I will like this movie too much. I enjoyed every single part of it. You can't take out any mistake in this movie. The performances by the actors, visuals, direction, writing, cinematography, music, sound effects .... you name it, everything was perfect. 

This movie is 80+ years old but still it feels so fresh. It's sad that nowadays we don't get these type of movies in which everything is done perfectly.

Overall, this movie surely deserves a watch. It us worth it. Perfect!"
175,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,audience,4.5,p,One of the most iconic movies of all time and a staple in cinema history this classic still holds up today despite being made in the 1940s and has inspired countless plays all of the characters are so unique each one has obstacles/challenges they must overcome if you haven't watched this masterpiece what are you waiting for!
176,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,audience,5.0,p,"A timeless classic that is very colorful, exciting, and rewatchable. I love the characters, the music, the set pieces, and the old school feel. One of the most satisfying movies you'll ever see."
177,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,audience,4.5,p,"Es bastante buena esta película.

Los efectos para la época eran muy buenos y además de tener una buena actuación de Judy Garland que para ser joven tuvo una buena Actuación y una tierna amistad.

Le doy una puntuación de 93."

179,the_wizard_of_oz_1939,audience,5.0,p,"It was great seeing a classic film like that on the big screen for the first time. They did turn on the house lights during the last five minutes, but luckily you could still see the movie."
180,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,"Spearheaded by a dynamite lead performance, this story of recovery and, more so, denial, reaches and aching honesty."
181,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,"The final act's quietly played emotional turmoil - in which Cooke really gets to spread her wings - is a triumph, building to an elegant and heart-warming finale."
182,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,"As inconsistent and inherently dubious as this aural gambit may be, it achieves a kind of blunt-force effectiveness in tandem with the earnest, wild-eyed performance by Ahmed."

188,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,"Sound of Metal is an astonishing accomplishment for both its long-nascent director and its British star, Riz Ahmed, for whom his turn as heavy metal drummer Ruben represents a career-best performance."
189,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,"It's a tour-de-force that requires real concentration to appreciate, the sort of concentration you'll find only in the cinema."
190,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,"What sets this apart from other films in the ""bloke sobs in the bathtub, then punches a hole in the wall"" personal anguish genre is how the deaf community is depicted."
191,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,"Sound of Metal never does anything particularly unexpected or intricate with its storyline, but the technical aspects of its filmmaking - from the editing to the sound profile to the acting - are always impressive."
192,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,Putting us in Ruben's head strengthens the theme of loss of identity... and makes the character's hardships hit harder than a drummer on a snare.
193,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,"Raci's performance, along with the deaf actress Lauren Ridloff's, makes Sound of Metal work, placing it beyond Ruben's individual condition and his harsh reactions to it with Lou..."
194,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,"Riz Ahmed is the voice, eyes, and soul of Sound of Metal. Words simply can't convey what his vacant looks can."
195,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,...a predominantly successful effort that confirms Ahmed's place as one of his generation's most promising up-and-coming actors.
196,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,"A triumph in acting and sound design, with the former featuring Riz Ahmed's career-best performance as Ruben Stone."
197,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,"While the plot stumbles with an unevenly paced final act, Sound of Metal is nevertheless an astoundingly affective and emotionally resonating character piece that shines an inspirational light on the Deaf community"
198,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,Ahmed pours himself into his role as a drummer rapidly losing his hearing and turns a pretty good movie into something close to great with a punishing performance...
199,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,This is a film that fuses the farthest limits of its form to tell its story and remind viewers of both the fragility and adaptability of life.
200,sound_of_metal,audience,4.5,p,Fascinating journey as the main character  comes to terms with his loss of hearing and gains insight into an alternative way of viewing the world.
201,sound_of_metal,audience,3.5,p,A realistic drama film about accepting deafness and drug addiction. Sound editing and the acting of Riz Ahmed (as Ruben) and Paul Raci (as Joe) is remarkable. The film’s title could also be a innuendo to the distorted sound from cochlear implant that led Ruben to accept deafness instead of fixing it.
202,sound_of_metal,audience,5.0,p,"While there haven't been many (and I still have a few more to view), Sound of Metal is likely my #2 movie of 2020, only slightly behind Da 5 Bloods. Unsurprisingly, Riz Ahmed as our protag, Ruben Stone, is incredible and, again, #2 performance of the year only behind Delroy Lindo in Da 5 Bloods — Elisabeth Moss is also up there for her performance in The Invisible Man. What is surprising is that Darius Marder made his directorial debut with this thought-provoking, touching, and entertaining film. Stone is ½ of the punk-rock duo, Blackgammon, the other half being his girlfriend, Lou (Olivia Cooke). Ruben — with the punk adage ""Please Kill Me"" tattooed across his chest — is a drummer who suddenly loses 90–99% of his hearing. If this wasn't enough, Ruben is a recovering addict, 4 years without using, and therefore needs — to his chagrin — not only a deaf-living house but sober-living, too. Marder uses sound in a way I've never experienced before — maybe because it's never been done(?) — to portray Ruben's disability. There was a moment when I thought the entire movie might've been conducted in this manner, which would've made a powerful point, but definitely would've been difficult to complete, but instead switches between regular hearing and the hearing-impaired. The direction and acting also beautifully showcases the frustrations of not being able to communicate. If there's one shot to stick with you, it's when all of the deaf school-children are resting on the grand-piano, Ruben right there with them. This movie is still new, so I'll spare more details, but the last three scenes, upon reflection, is one of the best sequences I've had the pleasure of viewing for a long time. There weren't many must-watches from 2020, but this is absolutely one of them."
203,sound_of_metal,audience,4.0,p,"Darius Marder's true debut and it's an interesting film. I thought for a long time that this was a documentary when I first got to know it. It sure has that look at times, but it's a bit deeper and has a few tailor made touches I guess. Ruben is a drummer in a metal band. He is an ex heroinist and lives with his girl and band member in his RV. They do gigs, but are never a big band. When he suddenly loses his hearing things naturally change. His career is no longer something to chase and he does not have much else. He gets into some sort of home. Kids and grown ups. Some earlier addicts, all of them are hearing impaired. He hats it at first, but likes it after a while. He still want's his surgery to make him hear again, but that's very expensive. His girl is someplace else and for some reason cell phones are prohibited from the home he stays as so there is not much contact between the two. 

Things are constantly happening here, mostly into something better. It has great sound, it looks good and it has a very great pace. It's never flat - but rarely big or really hitting you hard. A good film that could have been even better, but again, it could easily have been way worse too.

8 out of 10 drumkits."
204,sound_of_metal,audience,2.5,n,"Been meaning to watch this for a while.  Eh. It's gutsy making a movie with most of cast being deaf. Makes it hard for it to be captivating though. The performances were great, some of the direction and editing were decent, but overall the movie is kind of a bummer and not in a cool, thought provoking way. Kind of Oscar bait."
205,sound_of_metal,audience,5.0,p,"This is a film about the main character's struggle to adjust to losing his hearing, and about the community that helps him to adjust. It's an empathetic take on becoming deaf. The film says so much, despite the dialogue being sparse, and it shows the how peaceful, but at the same time lively, being deaf can be through a deft use of audio and visual techniques. It is full of engaging sensory experiences even though it is a film about the experience of losing a major sensory input. Excellent performance from Riz Ahmed and supporting cast, especially Paul Raci."
206,sound_of_metal,audience,4.0,p,81%. Very good movie. Interesting to see the perspective of deaf people like the sound of them all interacting via sign language at dinner. He goes to a home with other deaf adults and spends a lot of time with deaf kids. He's doing well but decides to sell his rv and music equipment for the surgery. He tells the head of the house and he tells him he broke his trust because everyone there doesn't see being deaf as a handicap or something that needs fixing. Would rewatch but not super worth it
207,sound_of_metal,audience,5.0,p,"Love the use of the sounds, definitely helps you immerse yourself in what Reuben is experiencing."
208,sound_of_metal,audience,5.0,p,"Sound Of Metal is a beautiful film about recognising and normalising one's differences. Although Darius Marder raises awareness for the deaf community, his sensitive message and emotional tale of self-discovery is universal. Although I never developed any hearing issues, I was diagnosed with a life-changing health condition at an early age. Ruben's loss of identity, isolation, and new lifestyle resonated on a personal level. Ultimately, Marder highlights what it means to be alive and to appreciate the unsung beauty of silence. Anchored by Riz Ahmed's incredible performance and heightened by the innovative sound design, Sound of Metal is a rewarding viewing experience."
209,sound_of_metal,audience,5.0,p,"This movie doesn't include a lot of conversation scene, however This movie taght me so many things....."
0,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,Small details... give weight to a story about an immaterial person. [Full review in Spanish]
1,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"A thriller whose mandate is to startle its audience with surface-level shocks while simultaneously subverting expectations in a deeper way, dropping us out of our comfort zone toward some sunken place."
2,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"He (Whannell) uses the cinematic language to his advantage, moving the camera in ways which show that he is in complete control of his audience."
3,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,Imbues its classic horror story with real-life terror.
4,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Though influenced by the earlier film, Writer-Director Leigh Whannell reworks outdated elements and comes up with a surprisingly relevant take on the powers provided by invisibility."
5,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"It's fast and violent but crystalline in clarity...letting us experience the violence, shame, confusion, and anger that Cecilia does rather than explaining it to us."
6,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,From the film's opening titles you can tell you're in for something special.
7,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,This film - with its science-fiction slant - delivers scares and works as a heightened examination of obsession and an abusive relationship.
8,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,Leigh Whannell's update of the classic concept stars Elisabeth Moss as the ex-girlfriend of a millionaire inventor turned high-tech gaslighter whose goal is to erase his victim's humanity as effectively as he has obscured his own visibility.
9,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,rotten,n,"The film falls into stale traps, ones so basic and obvious that it's almost maddening to see them regurgitated for yet another rote thriller."
10,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"With some great acting and solid storytelling, The Invisible Man has only strengthened the legacy of Wells' story."
11,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Timely, relevant, and genuinely terrifying...The Invisible Man recontextualizes a classic Universal monster into a modern examination of abuse, toxicity, and gaslighting."
12,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,It's doubtful any of The Invisible Man would work so well ... without Moss.
13,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Staring, waiting, preparing for the worst creates the most unease in the viewer ... Whannell's script is equal parts action, suspense and surprise. He doesn't go for the easy scare, and much of the film is anxiety-inducing, not seat-jumping."
14,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"'The Invisible Man' displays how victims can be in constant danger, whether they're at home or in a crowded room."
15,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The Invisible Man is one of the best horror movies in recent years and, of course, one of the best movies of 2020."
16,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Whannell's simmering long shots get under the skin, the ambient soundscape is successfully designed to terrify."
17,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Anchored by a raw performance from Elisabeth Moss, The Invisible Man cements Leigh Whannell's spot in the horror directors' Hall of Fame."
18,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"I may not have seen every invisible man remake and sequel there is, but of all the ones I have seen this is the best, even better than the original 1933 classic starring Claude Rains (which nevertheless was a technological marvel for its day)."
19,the_invisible_man_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Anchored by another awesome performance by Moss, this urgently topical reworking of the HG Wells tale is a terrifically gripping thriller - and a brilliant metaphor for hidden coercive control."
20,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,2.0,n,"Totally forgettable. Kinda cool, but these ratings are just… silly really."
21,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,5.0,p,Incredible film. Great theme. Ending made me jump out of my seat.

23,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,4.0,p,"I did not expect to like this film as much as I did. Interesting story well made, and definitely worth two hours of your time."
24,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,2.0,n,Wow!! Galway through the movie I began to root for the invisible to just kill her do the movie would end. How do directors watch a scene and not see the stupidity? Elizabeth Moss has a gun 5 inches from her and decided to grab it after about 8 policemen die? Seriously? A policeman sees something and decides to reach for a taser 10 seconds later?
25,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,3.5,p,"There are a lot of things not working in the film but then again, all horror films are flawed. The first part is strange and I didn't connect with the characters much. The thrill starts when ... oh, I'm not giving info about the best part, the last 1/3 of the film."
26,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,3.5,p,"I was losing interest in the rather slow first half of the movie. However, It does pick up dramatically and became a much more tense and interesting movie thereafter.
Worth the watch and Elizabeth moss is excellent in it."
27,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,2.5,n,"It was ok, trailer was more promising I'd say and in the end just weird."
28,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,1.0,n,"Wish I can make this film invisible.
1/2 star for directing that was clunky and cheap horror movieish. 

0 stars for another film ripping off a classic title, bastardizing from the true title origin and from future use.
 
1/2 star for Elizabeth Moss fair acting - but she over did it and failed to create a sympathetic character.  She came off as unlikeable to all other characters, so we did not feel empathetic to her survival.  The more I watched it the more I wished she would disappear."
29,the_invisible_man_2020,audience,1.5,n,Very entertaining. Interesting take on the invisible man. cheap-predictable rushed ending that insults the viewers intelligence.

31,azor,critics,fresh,p,A magnificent lesson on what should be seen on screen more often. [Full review in Spanish]
32,azor,critics,fresh,p,"Conceptually, Azor, is brilliant and its dreamlike editing that joins one meeting to the next with little connective tissue is often intriguing. But as a viewing experience, it is roundly obtuse with a repetitious, meandering narrative."
33,azor,critics,fresh,p,"Restraint and alarm are the film's keynotes, with a hint of wry black comedy in every exchange."
34,azor,critics,fresh,p,"""Azor"" is a film of impeccably polished facades capable of concealing horrors."
35,azor,critics,fresh,p,The feeling of uneasy dread grows throughout this memorable film: it is palpable but is never explained.
36,azor,critics,fresh,p,"Fontana's movie gives us a precise account of a society's codes of conduct - and a vague, disquieting sense of the corruption behind it all."
37,azor,critics,fresh,p,Fontana's sinewy debut teems with unseen threat. He crafts an atmosphere of grubbiness despite all the polished surfaces.
38,azor,critics,fresh,p,"It's a fine film, with a bleak message about how capitalism will thrive in just about any circumstance."
39,azor,critics,fresh,p,"As with the concealing language of the dictatorship, death is everywhere, just not on screen."
40,azor,critics,fresh,p,This superb debut feature from Andreas Fontana puts an ingenious spin on the paranoid thriller: its main character is determined to behave as if he isn't in one.
41,azor,critics,fresh,p,"Fontana models the surface of the film after Yvan: assertively calm. But the unease thrums, brilliantly evoked - as if in every scene, something nightmarish was always just out of shot. It is."
42,azor,critics,fresh,p,A genuinely mysterious journey into the heart of darkness.
43,azor,critics,fresh,p,An offbeat and ambitious work. One which largely succeeds in maintaining a tense and brooding undertone.
44,azor,critics,fresh,p,It is a film that continues to echo mysteriously inside my head.
45,azor,critics,fresh,p,"Azor is an intelligent, assured debut from Andreas Fontana, though its sober narrative translucency certainly won't be for everyone."
46,azor,critics,fresh,p,There's a compelling contrast between the comforting glow of this world and the consistent sense of threat that permeates the movie.
47,azor,critics,fresh,p,"The protagonist for this film may be an unassuming Swiss banker, but he would be at home in a novel by Graham Greene or John le Carré."
48,azor,critics,fresh,p,"Although it's hard to think of a story about a banker being a real white knuckler, Fontana turns Azor into just that."
49,azor,critics,fresh,p,The supporting actors are the true highlights here -- Ines with her ambition and calculating coldness; a boorish lawyer for the nouveau riche; and a particularly creepy and soft-spoken monsignor.
50,azor,audience,5.0,p,"Brilliant. Among other things, this is one of the best depictions of human evil that I've ever seen on screen. And yet, not a single shot is fired.

The film is set in Argentina in 1980. A right-wing military junta (backed, unfortunately, by the US) is in the process of kidnapping, torturing, and murdering thousands of civilians. But you wouldn't know it from this movie - except from anxious, oblique references - because the social class the film depicts is (almost) completely insulated from the violence that's done to protect their interests. Still, there's tension and dread beneath the surface, from start to finish."
51,azor,audience,1.5,n,"It's one of those typical movies that movie critics salivate over. The tension that all the reviews allude to comes from pointless dialogues and long silences and those long shots that's supposed to represent the character's loneliness and internal turmoil. For most part the dialogues are stiff and theatrical, it just feels like a play for most of the time, and a really pretensions and boring one. The main character looks like he has a constipation for the entire movie. This should have been a TV movie at best. The pretentious references to The Heart of Darkness like traveling down the river to meet the baddie is just that - pretentious references.

The only quality comes in the last 5 minutes but it doesn't justify the dreadful 85 minutes that supersede that.

It tries to be like Friedkin's Sorcerer (especially using that transistor music which in this movie really feels fake and forced) or Antonioni&#39;s The Passenger. It&#39;s neither and doesn't come even close. If you want to watch a good movie about that disappearances in Argentina at the time of the military junta watch Costa-Gavras' Missing with Jack Lemon. This is just a poor, student's tribute to 70's political drama.

I&#39;m giving it 3 stars because there are movies worse than this. I thought about giving it 1 just to correct the rating because this film is absolutely nowhere 10, 9 or even 8. Critics giving it 100/100 is just a joke..."
52,azor,audience,5.0,p,"If you have a soft spot for a classic build up with a vintage twist in the mold of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, you'll absolutely love this. One of the most exquisite thrillers in a while."
53,azor,audience,1.0,n,"Good lord, this was painful to sit through. I don't know what the critics were looking at.  The music/sound was jarring to the extent that sometimes I thought I was hearing noise from adjoining theaters bleeding into mine. The primary actors, I guess, were representing the emotional pulse of bankers, wives of bankers, friends of bankers, etc., but my God, that didn't warrant making me sit through two hours watching them.  I began to fidget throughout, as I kept waiting for something of interest to happen. Others will call it, ""... a quiet, unhurried, un-flashy film..."" or ""a real white knuckler."" I would call it just plain boring!!!"
54,in_the_heights_2021,critics,fresh,p,"The production has inarguably broken Hollywood's self-imposed taboos on depicting the Hispanic experience in the States, not to mention upending the studios' reluctancy to allow Hispanics to be groomed for stardom."

67,in_the_heights_2021,critics,rotten,n,Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical directed by Jon Chu is too long to sustain its kind plotting and rousing musical interludes...
68,in_the_heights_2021,critics,fresh,p,"The choreography (by Christopher Scott) is always terrific and there's that unstoppable energy which, given the film's running time, might eventually have you shouting: ""Stop. Stop with the unstoppable energy! I'm over it!"" But, you know, what the hell."

77,in_the_heights_2021,audience,5.0,p,"Every time you watch this movie, you notice something new. It's always good. The music is outstanding, the performances are too. A must-watch!"
78,in_the_heights_2021,audience,4.0,p,The musical is (of course) better. But this was still very good. There were a few ~quirky~ directorial choices that took me out of the story though. But fantastic performances all around. Benny and Vanessa were the standouts for me (and obvi Stephanie Beatriz.)
79,in_the_heights_2021,audience,5.0,p,"A beautiful love letter too all Latinos living in foreign countries. Beautiful music, energetic dances, emotionally impactful and full of life. A must see."
80,in_the_heights_2021,audience,3.5,p,Good. A bit of a DACA commercial. But cute
81,in_the_heights_2021,audience,5.0,p,"A wonderful celebration of life, culture, and dreams. What Fargo did for winter, In the Heights does for summer. Every musical number stands out on its own, the editing compliments the music beautifully, the ensemble is one-of-a-kind and, for the most part, the film is just plain fun."
82,in_the_heights_2021,audience,3.0,p,"Dazzling choreographies and catchy songs, In the Heights is a fell-good musical that celebrates the importance of heritage and community - the second act, though, drags along the way and the final act leaves us missing something."
83,in_the_heights_2021,audience,2.0,n,"The story and the characters are too stereotypical and borderline boring. The songs don't make up for that.
The filming and choreography are probably great, but you don't get to watch them because of the fast-paced editing that shifts perspective every few seconds."

105,luzzu,audience,3.0,p,This movie had a story to tell and message about the environment to get across but overall it was pretty slow. I think if the main characters weren't so sullen throughout the film it would have been more realistic and entertaining.

114,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"While Argo does have it's flaws, the film strives for overall authenticity."
115,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"Although the partially true story succumbs to some rather silly Hollywood tropes towards the end, ARGO does an engaging job of burnishing both sides of the Affleck coin."
116,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"You cannot call it a comedy, you cannot even call it a straight book-to-film adaptation - but you can call Argo so many other things: a satirical political thriller, gripping, tense...and fantastic."
117,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"A detailed, true story that has some trouble finding its footing between political thriller and suspense movie."
118,argo_2012,critics,rotten,n,The film plays out in the broadest of broad strokes with Affleck employing a lowest common denominator tone that would make the most hackneyed of Hollywood filmmakers proud.
119,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"As a director Affleck's impressive, expanding on the promise he showed in Gone Baby Gone and The Town. He's adopted a much lighter style for Argo, with a zippy curve-ball narrative spins from wit to suspense."
120,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,You've really got to hand it to Affleck.
121,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,Both a riveting spy thriller and an emotionally engaging piece of historical filmmaking.
122,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"This is a movie best seen with as little knowledge as possible, making the surprises (even the ones that are predictable) that much more entertaining."
123,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"It's a smart and hugely enjoyable action thriller as it is, with some wicked humor and a feel-good ending that's manipulative, sure, but was, in part, bequeathed to us by history."
124,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"For any audience, it is a thriller that provides constant rising tension and actual thrills."
125,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"Not only that Argo is both intelligent and entertaining, it's riveting from start to finish."
126,argo_2012,critics,rotten,n,"The action is exciting, the Hollywood scenes are dryly funny. But we never get to know the people for whom this farcical plot has been invented."
127,argo_2012,audience,4.0,p,"Enjoyable action and contains some tension, but it ultimately felt inaccurate and lacked character depth. The story was important to share and perfect for a film. Unfortunately, the characters were abandoned in terms of development in favour of focusing on the plot, and several events were clearly modified for the purposes of drama. On the other hand, the pacing wasn't too slow nor too fast, the acting was believable, the cinematography felt modern, the visual effects were decent, the sets/props/costumes seemed genuine enough, and the soundtrack was catchy and effective."
128,argo_2012,audience,4.5,p,"An edge of your seat movie with dark humor, it recreates the Iran Hostage crisis with incredible attention to detail and tremendous characters.  Ben Affleck does it again with direction as this felt more like a movie from an earlier era- less showy, frenetic and more focused on narrative.  The only knock is there are so many characters, it is hard to develop them all."
129,argo_2012,audience,4.0,p,"Argo ha senza dubbio una sceneggiatura di qualità; che probabilmente pecca di mancanza di azione per essere totalmente adatta al grande schermo.
Forse questo è l'unico punto debole del racconto; il bisogno hollywoodiano di inserire un finale al cardiopalma e denso di suspense, quando probabilmente sarebbe stato meglio attenersi alla storia vera visto il tipo di film.
Molto interessante la narrazione degli eventi che hanno portato a questa assurda missione; a cui giustamente viene data la priorità rispetto al racconto dei personaggi.
Peccato per una prima scena un po' troppo rapida, in cui non si capisce molto bene la sequenza degli eventi."
130,argo_2012,audience,3.0,p,"It might be true that it takes one day to learn to direct, but then it's true that an entire life is not enough to learn writing."
131,argo_2012,audience,5.0,p,Great Movie! Check out Persepolis!
132,argo_2012,audience,3.5,p,"Anxious, engaging, and interesting, but overall, Argo is a commonly played out political thriller."
133,argo_2012,audience,4.5,p,The beginning makes it impossible for me to root for the Americans.  There should be discussions about what happened back then.  I'm guessing there have been discussions and I missed them all.  Movies are important.
134,argo_2012,audience,5.0,p,An old school edge-of-the-seat thriller of the kind they don't seem to make any more. This reminded me what a pity that is.
135,argo_2012,audience,4.5,p,"It was an amazing and intense ride. The only thing I knew about Argo was that it won the Oscar for Best Picture, I didn't expected this incredible film."

143,never_rarely_sometimes_always,critics,fresh,p,Hittman's raw and painfully realistic dialogue is so captivating. All of Autumns conversations are incredibly natural. And the emotions hit hard when she's at her final destination.

159,never_rarely_sometimes_always,audience,4.0,p,"""Never Rarely Sometimes Always"" is a completely riveting film experience about very real, sensitive problems women face, and is especially hard for a man to watch, but totally worth it. This film actually moved me.

160,never_rarely_sometimes_always,audience,5.0,p,This movie is awesome!
161,never_rarely_sometimes_always,audience,5.0,p,A true gem. If you have young daughters please make sure they watch this movie. Every adolescent should watch it.
162,never_rarely_sometimes_always,audience,5.0,p,"This is the movie to watch! Bitter-sweet. It is a harsh look at what it is to be a teen girl, but extraordinarily relatable and beautifully executed. It was so well-written, I recognized every character in this movie. Truly gorgeous. The two main actors give amazing performances."
163,never_rarely_sometimes_always,audience,4.0,p,A bit too much that every single male in this film is into sexual harassment but overall a very good one
164,never_rarely_sometimes_always,audience,3.5,p,A good exercise of independent cinema with hard moments and low ratio. 7/10
165,never_rarely_sometimes_always,audience,4.0,p,"Deeply moving without ever being sensationalised or playing to the gallery, this is a subtle and understated story of a teenager's long-distance trip to New York for an abortion. The scene from which the film takes its title - a series of questions asked of the central character about her relationships - is a masterpiece, simply focussing on her and her almost wordless reactions. Nothing else in the film quite matches up to that, but there's not much wrong with it either. Compassionate and humane."
166,never_rarely_sometimes_always,audience,3.5,p,"This is a film with an important plot, taking up an issue many young girls deal with around the world. Autumn is 18 and pretty much a typical, moody teenager. She finds out that she is pregnant and the race for an abortion is on. She must travel to other cities to get things done and along with her is the much more popular girl, Skylar - one of her few friends.

The plot is serious, but it's done in a very plesant way. Never graphic, supersad or painful to watch. It's almost educational in the way it's presented and I would say it's a film to be watched for young teenage boys and girls. Eliza Hittman is quite a fresh director and she brings Sidney Flanigan to the screen, the protagonist. She is very impressive here and there is no doubt that this should be her breaktrough.
Good film that got some well deserved hype.

7.5 out of 10 trimesters."

189,toy_story_3,audience,4.0,p,Was pretty good still but can't match Toy Story 1 or 2. Perfect end to what should've been a trilogy
190,toy_story_3,audience,4.5,p,"Blends comedy, adventure, and emotion it is a rare third part that works.  More so than what attracts children, this whole series turned out to be a long, melancholy meditation on loss, impermanence and that little thing called love.  Might be the best of the four movies."
191,toy_story_3,audience,5.0,p,"até hoje, o filme que mais chorei na vida."
192,toy_story_3,audience,5.0,p,"This will always be one of my favorite movies. It manages to be so many things all at the same time, While still being able to be watched by all ages, if you haven't seen this I definitely recommend you do (you will probably be thanking me as soon as it's over)."
193,toy_story_3,audience,4.0,p,"As Andy is preparing for college, his favorite toys accidentally get donated to a daycare instead of being stored in the attic. It is truly amazing that the story tellers at Pixar can continually add a fresh take on these characters with every sequel. All the voice actors do a great job continuing or introducing their characters. Lotso is a well written villain with a sympathetic backstory. The animation is terrific and it is amazing how the look of these characters have changed since the first Pixar movie. The ending will bring tears or warm-fuzzies depending on your mood. Highly recommended movie and a great ending to one of the best trilogies in cinematic history."
194,toy_story_3,audience,5.0,p,A whole fluid drama!
195,toy_story_3,audience,4.0,p,A great 3rd installment of the series with character depth improved...nearly as good as 1
196,toy_story_3,audience,5.0,p,"AMAZING!!! If you don't have the feels in the trash seen, you don't have a heart!"
197,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"For me, it didn't fulfill the promise of Infinity War, but it did fulfill the promise of the previous twenty movies."
198,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"I'm just grateful to have the privilege to watch this along with the rest of the world. It's not perfect, but it has been one hell of a ride."
199,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"Here's the other really neat thing about Endgame: it made me think of priorities in life and what or who is worth sacrificing for, especially loved ones..."
200,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,The true superteam event releases marked something slightly different and spectacular...End Game over the original Guardians by a hair...
201,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,This goes beyond the usual scale.
202,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,A film that somehow manages to be as epic as fans hope and as dramatic as the MCU deserves.
203,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"Films don't come any huger than this: the closing chapter to an 11-year saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, told across some 22 movies. And by the end of its three-hour runtime, there will definitely be tears."
204,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,There really is very little that could be improved about Endgame. There's certainly no more that could be thrown at it.
205,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"So much of the art form is about storytelling, and bringing so many side stories and characters to a satisfying conclusion is tough, and the film blended a (rather) unpredictable plot with emotional character beats deftly..."
206,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"Avengers: Endgame is everything Marvel fans could want and more. It will be interesting to see how the MCU moves into the future after the events in the film, but woe be upon anyone who doubts their ability to adapt and succeed mightily."
207,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,I found Avengers: Endgame wonderfully satisfying.
208,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,There are [Marvel] movies that have been just as entertaining and a lot smarter than this one.
209,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"Feels like the end of the old cycle, the beginning of a reset. Old favourites gone, passing the mantle to others before they go. We even see a poster that reads, ""Where do we go, now that they're all gone?"""
210,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"The MCU is the ultimate long game, and Endgame feels like its glorious final lap."
211,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"Terms like masterpiece and game-changer are often thrown around a bit hastily, but not on this occasion."
212,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"The fight scenes, while chaotic and intermittently exhilarating, are unable to avoid repetition; such is the nature of invincible entities dueling other invincible entities."
213,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"""Avengers: Endgame"" was a wonderful surprise, filling almost every minute (all 181 of them) with excitement, drama, humor, and visually interesting and entertaining intrigue."
214,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,What The Russo Brothers did here is take high expectations and blow them out of the water with an emotionally thrilling finale. Get ready to be moved!
215,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,The only thing that I know for sure has ended with the Marvel Cinematic Universe is my patience.
216,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"Endgame is nothing short of a deserved send-off to the Infinity Saga, stamping an impressive mark on the cultural psyche. It has been one hell of a ride."
217,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,p,"Avengers Endgame is the perfect conclusion to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If it were the final movie in the entire series I would be very content with it, but it does setup a different world we will come to see in the future. As a fan of the comics the movies are based on, and a huge fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole this movie was made with people like me in mind and I loved it. It brought emotion, laughs, and plenty of references and moments I have been wanting to see. For people who haven't seen a Marvel movie before this one, don't start here. This is not a movie for the average moviegoer to see without any background information and it will be incredibly boring, and you will be lost the entire time. For everyone else though, see this movie, enjoy it, and possibly even see it again. This is by far one of my favorite films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and has plenty of scenes I will be watching again and again when it releases on Blu-ray."
218,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,p,Amazing film considering the build up for the story for over a decade. Amazing.
219,avengers_endgame,audience,4.5,p,4/5 on the extraordinary scale. On the normal scale it is a 15/10.
220,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,p,Perfect movie and perfect ending tribute to captain America and iron man
221,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,p,"A Masterpiece! I absolutely loved everything about that movie, and have watched it over and over again and still absolutely loved it! Amazingly done!"
222,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,p,"Fantastic culmination of MCU storylines! Acting is outstanding and although the movie is long, no scene is wasted. An absolute treat for Marvel fans."
223,avengers_endgame,audience,3.0,p,"Nothing much to see here, just a return to the usual Marvel-movie quality level. It's good to see the non-superhero Iron Man finally removed from the picture, with his only power in being a rich guy and owner of advanced technology (and completely unconvincingly portrayed as being smart enough to build or fix said technology himself; kind of the equivalent of that other grossly overrated rich tech guy character we have IRL in a certain Elon Musk), though sadly they did have to turn him into The Great Martyr to get him over with.

Really the only impressive Avengers movie in a long time was Infinity War, because it actually did something different and interesting, i.e. killing a lot of superheroes, and introduced a really good, complex villain. Beyond that, all they can do is return to their teen-boy oriented Marvel-as-usual movies."
224,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,p,AMAZING I LOVED THE PART WHEN SHARK BOY 360° NO SCOPED MARIO JUDA WHILE LEBRON JAMES DUNKED ON THANOS
225,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,p,PERFECT. I mean everything about this movie is beyond perfection.
226,avengers_endgame,audience,4.5,p,"Intense, enthralling, and emotionally fulfilling in all the right ways, Avengers: Endgame is a cultural phenomenon that deserves all of its acclaim, past, present, and future."
0,selma,critics,fresh,p,"There's a lump in your throat at the of ""Selma,"" a movie that wisely takes a a snapshot of King's life from the moment he wins the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 through the Selma march in 1965."
1,selma,critics,fresh,p,The controversial story of America's civil rights marches prickles with violence and emotion.
2,selma,critics,fresh,p,"A historical document, but so alive and timely, it is essential viewing almost fifty years after King's assassination."
3,selma,critics,fresh,p,Selma is the best kind of biopic (if you can even call it that).
4,selma,critics,fresh,p,"One of the most effective, well-crafted historical biopics that I've ever seen... giving us a moment in history that feels immediately familiar to the moment we are currently living in."
5,selma,critics,fresh,p,"Wisely uses affective montages, orchestral music, tight pacing, and award-worthy acting to supplement the intense recreations of iconic undertakings."
6,selma,critics,fresh,p,Truly a film that must be seen by today's youth so that we can keep Selma and Ferguson from happening in the future.
7,selma,critics,fresh,p,"Selma is worthy of my highest recommendation. Hopefully like me, you'll clap once the end credits roll."
8,selma,critics,fresh,p,"The acting is exquisite, and DuVernay directs with a sure and confident hand. It's not only the story of Martin Luther King Jr.; it's the story of the American People."
9,selma,critics,fresh,p,"Leaves audiences moved and shaken; this is a movie that will resonate and be remembered for a very, very long time."
10,selma,critics,fresh,p,"In bringing together the personal, the political, and the historic, DuVernay has crafted a film that will be remembered and studied for years to come."
11,selma,critics,fresh,p,"...offering not only a superbly-realized presentation of a particular series of events, but also a sense of what it meant to live through the historical period in question."
12,selma,critics,fresh,p,It's the weight of history that gives Selma so much emotional heft.
13,selma,critics,fresh,p,"...[I]n zooming in on one moment, director DuVernay and writer Paul Webb really force us to live in the trial by fire that was the American South in 1965."
14,selma,critics,fresh,p,"As director, DuVernay employs a style of storytelling... that makes it possible for audiences to find the film engrossing, entertaining, and educational."
15,selma,critics,fresh,p,"Selma is spectacularly staged, impressively acted and narratively satisfying. But it is also something much, much more and we need much, much more like it."
16,selma,critics,fresh,p,"Selma tells a great story about a triumphant moment in civil rights history and the losses it took to get that win, but it doesn't nostalgically let us forget that this moment is just a chapter break in a longer war that still rages on today."
17,selma,critics,fresh,p,There is nothing saccharine about Selma. DuVernay does justice to the illustrious subject matter... and that's no mean feat.
18,selma,critics,fresh,p,A very satisfying picture.
19,selma,critics,fresh,p,"In a time where dedicated activists are speaking their own truths to leaders who are often even less responsive, movies such as Selma feel more essential than ever."
20,selma,audience,3.5,p,"This was a hugely enlightening viewing experience. I wasn't aware of even half of the finer details portrayed about the marches and how there were so many other leaders under MLK that did a lot of the hard work like that. I had imagined he had a huge cult of personality surrounding him and that he just mustered people to his side whenever he wanted to organize and can see now that that was never the case. I do wish he'd been given the Malcolm X treatment though; this moment in history was certainly worthy of its own movie like this, but I find myself wanting to see more of his life elaborated upon. I did prefer The Butler over this movie for a few reasons that mostly boil down to that movie having simpler source material to adapt; this movie was super chaotic by comparison and because its source material didn't go off without a hitch, watching it happen as a movie leads to non-ideal lurches in pace. It didn't help that this one had so many historical figures in it whose names I was just not at all familiar with & who were so numerous that few received much screentime, causing some confusion in me as I sat through this one."
21,selma,audience,5.0,p,"This is a reminder of the dangers black people faced, and continue to face, simply attempting to access the rights that are promised to them by our corrupt governmen(s)."
22,selma,audience,5.0,p,Historical and moving. this film was played in my high school History class and it was some of the best class days this year. I found myself immersed in the film and I cared a lot about what happened. The film itself was well paced and fairly easy to follow although it was paused several times during the class for explanations. The struggles depicted in this movie are brutal and shocking which largely make up the films conflict. Including the brutality of the police and racism of the town of Selma the film also includes President Johnson who's performance was one of the best as he truly seems like the actual President Johnson. His character is one of the most complicated as he wants to help the protagonist MLK give African Americans the right to vote but he also has other priorities. When MLK won't take no for an answer Johnson makes some dirty moves on Martin in order to stop him from marching on the capitol. He seems to have good intentions but isn't making his citizens right to vote his priority and he also uses harsh language later in the film when speaking with the intolerant governor of Selma. The lead and protagonist Martin Luthor King is a charismatic and driven character. He makes for an incredibly compelling character as he isn't portrayed as perfect by any means but the film intelligently is able to display his flaws and mistakes while still treating him like the hero he is to the civil rights movement. The supporting cast while not playing huge roles in the film or having much character arcs still contribute to the film and every character they follow has their moment good or bad. The end is a little choppy with the use of text to explain what happens after the events of the film but showing what actually happens after the film with the exception of MLK would not have made for a compelling movie and honestly aren't stories worth telling so why they chose to use text is understandable. Overall the film takes an incredible story of a political strategist and minister who through planning and sacrifice was able to lead the African American community to gaining the right to vote. The film is filled with powerful triumph and sadness as obstacles and loss is dealt with but perseverance jumped over the hurdles were able to bring change to a time that treated some Americans as less of a person.
23,selma,audience,5.0,p,There's only one word that can describe this film: Beautiful. Extremely well made.
24,selma,audience,4.5,p,"Ciò che più colpisce di Selma è l'estrema eleganza con cui viene narrata l'intera vicenda; si racconta di pagine nere della storia americana e di personaggi infimi; lo si fa senza far mancare nulla eppure senza essere troppo espliciti o violenti più del dovuto.
Il ritratto di Luther King jr è completo, introspettivo e molto personale; colpisce come si riesca a rendere perfetta la presenza del personaggio; come se lo si conoscesse per davvero.
Il tutto completato da una canzone meravigliosa e meritatamente premiata con un Oscar.
Qualche immagine di repertorio in più su ciò che realmente accadde, sarebbe stata gradita."
25,selma,audience,5.0,p,"The greatest movie about MLK, Jr.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
26,selma,audience,5.0,p,Very touching movie that the whole world has to see!
27,selma,audience,4.0,p,"I saw this movie when it came out, I was much younger then I am now, and it had a powerful effect on me. Rewatching it now it leaves much to be desired but in the time frame it was released it was powerful."
28,selma,audience,4.0,p,"Except for the portrayal of Lyndon B Johnson, this was an exceptional film! David Oyelowo is incredible as Martin Luther King jr that its shocking to believe he wasn’t nominated for an oscar."
29,selma,audience,0.5,n,Very boring. Didn't reach the end.
30,murderball,critics,fresh,p,"Murderball is a movie that's easier to admire than adore, and its makers wouldn't have it any other way."
31,murderball,critics,fresh,p,A celebration of the human spirit and a testimony of the power of the human body to adapt and heal.
32,murderball,critics,fresh,p,"Murderball tends to buck the feel-good vibe and good guy-bad guy arc of that genre... Instead, the film depicts a more profound and lifelong battle waged between these men and the circumstance they find themselves in."
33,murderball,critics,fresh,p,"There's little room for tears in the testosterone-riddled territory of quadriplegic rugby. ""Murderball"" spat on that power of the human spirit stuff and rolled along to a kick-ass showcase of not what spinal injury excluded, but what it enabled."
34,murderball,critics,fresh,p,"a triumph of filmmaking: of structure, character development, and pacing"
35,murderball,critics,fresh,p,"The quadriplegic rugby sport referred to as ""Murderball"" is lovingly examined in a well-crafted documentary that goes a long way toward showing the mental and physical fortitude of these wheelchair bound athletes who insist on living life to the fullest."
36,murderball,critics,fresh,p,Arguably the greatest sports movie since Hoop Dreams and When We Were Kings.
37,murderball,critics,fresh,p,Murderball is no Rocky-esque hymn to the human spirit. It's more like a prison movie...
38,murderball,critics,fresh,p,"Filmmakers Henry Alex Rubin and Dana Adam Shapiro wisely chose a high-energy aesthetic to portray quadriplegic rugby (a.k.a. ""Murderball"") through the story of Mark Zupan and his American teammates battling for Paralympic gold."
39,murderball,critics,fresh,p,"Even when the movie tries to shoe-horn its stories into the standard documentary mold, it serves to drive home the point: these guys aspire to the same clichés as the rest of us."
40,murderball,critics,fresh,p,"An honest, down-to-earth account of how life goes on for people with disabilities."
41,murderball,critics,fresh,p,"What emerges is more interesting, thankfully, than a linear offering of sporting triumph in the face of adversity."
42,murderball,critics,fresh,p,All of the men are striking examples of the indomitable human spirit.
43,murderball,critics,fresh,p,A leftfield sports documentary that's as insightful and thought-provoking as it is fast and furious.
44,murderball,critics,fresh,p,"Alm de revelador e interessante, sua inteligente montagem prende a ateno do espectador atravs do desenvolvimento de seus ""personagens"" e do conflito entre os dois times principais."
45,murderball,critics,fresh,p,"It's an ode to the indomitable stubbornness of people, really, to pursue what gets them off, no matter what it takes."
46,murderball,critics,fresh,p,"Murderball doesn't want you to feel sorry for anyone. It wants the viewer to see them for who they are, not what they aren't. They're athletes with the same drive and passion for their sport as other athletes."
47,murderball,critics,fresh,p,A deftly crafted window into a sport few know much about.
48,murderball,critics,fresh,p,"Most importantly, Murderball isn't afraid to depict its characters in a less than flattering light, so we really get a good feel for what each of the individuals are like."
49,murderball,critics,fresh,p,
50,murderball,audience,5.0,p,"I remember seeing this movie when it came out, such a great documentary. inspiring too"
51,murderball,audience,4.0,p,"While there is some discomfort by unnerving chills from watching wheelchair-confined soldiers, in their own right, with mental sympathetic empathy over their disabled functions, this raw documentary reassures in entertaining form that they live their lives with strength in overcoming their limitations while making the best out of the situation through fitting, encouraging outlets. (B+)"
52,murderball,audience,2.5,n,"Just didn't find it all that entertaining. Standard documentary, nothing too exceptional to it. Find it tough to watch the subject matter too. Guess we take a lot for granted most the time. That hit home watching this."
53,murderball,audience,3.5,p,Insightful but sometimes also sentimental.
54,murderball,audience,5.0,p,"A great expose on Murderball, aka Paraplegic Rugby.  Does a masterful job of showing the people behind the characters, as well as the teams behind the rivalries.  For anyone who thought Football players were the toughest dudes on Earth, give this flick a watch and see if you still come out with that POV."
55,murderball,audience,5.0,p,Very inspirational movie. Very entertaining and great for a sports movie.
56,murderball,audience,4.0,p,"Emotional, intense, exciting, and it's a documentary..."
57,murderball,audience,4.0,p,"his is one high energy,action doc with Zupan just taking over every scene he's in."
58,murderball,audience,5.0,p,Very accurate portrayal of life in a wheelchair.
59,murderball,audience,5.0,p,"A massive triumph of the human spirit in the face of enormous physical adversity, Murderball is heartwarming, hilarious, heartbreaking, and ultimately heroic. You will never view a physically handicapped person the same way after watching this film. Everyone should see this movie."
60,gravity_2013,critics,fresh,p,A taut thrill ride.
61,gravity_2013,critics,fresh,p,"If you want utter spectacle in the most realistic way possible, Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity may have been the in-theater experience of the decade."
62,gravity_2013,critics,rotten,n,"A few twists and unpredictable scenarios pop up to keep the intrigue alive for an impressive length, but a lack of solid character development and plot cheapens the momentum."
63,gravity_2013,critics,fresh,p,Gravity doesn't so much immerse you in its cinematic experience as it simply takes you there and sets you down among the stars.
64,gravity_2013,critics,fresh,p,[Gravity] is not just a spectacle that shows us the beauty and horrors of space but also a survival tale and a tale about grief.
65,gravity_2013,critics,fresh,p,"As a sci-fi geek, Gravity naturally ticks all the boxes that I expect from a sci-fi film and reminds me why I fell in love with the genre in the first place."
66,gravity_2013,critics,fresh,p,"By turns chilling, engaging, and breathtaking, Gravity juxtaposes the serenity of extreme quiet with moments of swirling, chaotic terror as it hurtles through space."
67,gravity_2013,critics,fresh,p,"At the end of the getaway, Gravity is a film that will be talked about for many years to come, and not because of the realistic approach to space, but because of its technical originality. [Full review in Spanish]"
68,gravity_2013,critics,fresh,p,It was well made.
69,gravity_2013,critics,fresh,p,I was never bored.
70,gravity_2013,critics,fresh,p,Cuarón has created an absolutely singular experience that is a marvel to watch.
71,gravity_2013,critics,fresh,p,"Cuaron's journey into space is a great achievement, pushing the limits of what we can do with technology on screen and hinting at where it can go in the future."
72,gravity_2013,critics,fresh,p,Bullock's dizzyingly complex performance in a film that is as thrilling as it is culturally resonant makes Gravity something hella special.
73,gravity_2013,critics,fresh,p,"It literally takes your breath away, yet it's a triumph of weightless entertainment sans gravitas. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Escape doesn't get much better."
74,gravity_2013,critics,fresh,p,It will reinvigorate your love of movies.
75,gravity_2013,critics,fresh,p,"There are some truly incredible sequences in here, and for a studio tentpole it's quite original, but don't expect a masterpiece."
76,gravity_2013,critics,fresh,p,"A wondrous experience, a space epic on a grand and rare scale that is one of this year's can't miss films."
77,gravity_2013,critics,fresh,p,Believe the hype.
78,gravity_2013,critics,fresh,p,It's unlike anything you've ever seen - full of breathtaking visuals that should be witnessed on the biggest screen you can find.
79,gravity_2013,critics,fresh,p,"This won't be the film many were expecting but as pure spectacle cinema, Gravity is breathtaking."
80,gravity_2013,audience,4.0,p,"Great acting, unbelievable CGI, and a story that does not depend on the typical tropes we see in Hollywood nowadays. Yes, those from survivor stories apply, but outstanding and original nonetheless."
81,gravity_2013,audience,3.0,p,"First 20 minutes were amazing. Unfortunately, afterwards it was too slow and uninteresting. It should've stuck with the horror vibe it was going for at first."
82,gravity_2013,audience,3.5,p,In space no one can hear you snore
83,gravity_2013,audience,1.0,n,"The worst film and most technically inept movie I have ever seen. Can't understand why anyone would pay to watch this rubbish and 7 Oscar's????
The producers must have paid the academy."
84,gravity_2013,audience,4.5,p,"Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity is a roller coaster ride through space, a testament to the resilience of a human being in the face of unimaginable adversity.  Sandra Bullock plays Dr Ryan Stone, an astronaut left alone in the vast expanse of space when her colleagues are killed by space debris.  The entire film is thrilling, but the first thirty minutes are absolutely remarkable, a crowning achievement in special effects and cinematography.  The special effects and cinematography are stellar throughout the film, as are the sound effects and the performance by Bullock.  The scene of Bullock making radio contact with a father consoling a crying baby is both inspiring and heartbreaking.  Rarely has a film packed so much into an 82-minute running time."
85,gravity_2013,audience,5.0,p,"As thrilling as ""No Country For Old Men"", and as beautiful as ""Interstellar"", Gravity is Cuarons' masterpiece. A titillating survival expedition, filled with hope and optimism."
86,gravity_2013,audience,1.5,n,"There's no denying that this film is a cinematic masterpiece when it comes to the cinematography and sound design, but there's a distinct lack of story and drive which makes it quite disappointing and monotonous in places. I won't score a 1 as the CGI carried this movie, and helped boost the score ever so slightly.  Clooney's character death felt like a desperate attempt to get some action in. Also, Bullock won a nomination for her acting? This wasn't deserved in the slightest, mostly grunting, heavy breathing, and terrible one liner cliché comments. There is a heart-racing premise and there are indeed incredible special effects, but it falls short and mostly at the hands of the actors and narrative arc."
87,gravity_2013,audience,5.0,p,"Better than most, if not all, space movies. Cuaron is a stellar director."
88,gravity_2013,audience,4.5,p,"Stunning view with high octane suspense from start to the end, what can you ask for more from 2 awards winners? Absolutely in my re-watch list, pretty scary will piss & shit your pants but not a horror movie."
89,gravity_2013,audience,0.5,n,"If you want to waste your time, watch this. The CGI is pretty ok, but man, this movie was terrible. Bad acting of Sandra AND George! Plots suck, just not credible.
The best part was the frog. Thanks this great acting skills, there was some fun in it."
90,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,rotten,n,There's no easy to way to say this: Davis is horrendously miscast in the role.
91,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"We are our own demons. This is Boseman's last film and probably his best acting, combining rage and passion. The movie presents its characters through dialogue, and uses its music for catharsis and tension instead of pleasure. [Full review in Spanish]"
92,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"This film should be an essential addition in any filmmaker course, for what it does right and where it failed-Viola Davis in a fat suit."
93,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"A touching final performance from Chadwick Boseman wonderfully rounds out this sweaty, robust drama of music and indignation."
94,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"A film that rides on the coat-tails of its magnificent leads. Davis and Boseman give two of the finest performances on screen this past year, but it's a slow-burn and definitely lacks universal appeal."
95,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"While it's sad that this is the last performance of one of the best actors of the last decade, it's also obvious as hell that Chadwick Boseman, as with everything he ever did, gave it his all."
96,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,That distinctive face and sooty make up engulf you.
97,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is an example of what happens when a director and cast have intimate knowledge of the material, making it as great as it can be."
98,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"Not coincidentally, the abject absence of a benign, just deity runs through Tony Award-winning director George C. Wolfe's sublime adaptation of Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, August Wilson's 1984 Pulitzer Prize-winning play."
99,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,rotten,n,"[The film] feels respectful yet bloodless, unwilling to risk much in cinematic transposition, and thus putting all of the responsibility on the performers to provide the juice."
100,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,A moving and powerful adaptation commanded by Davis and Boseman's towering performances. [Full Review in Spanish]
101,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,A beautiful piece of film that captures the root of theater and the very gut of Blues.
102,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,rotten,n,"On stage, Wilson's work retains an operatic force - it's big, and expressionistic and impactful. But on screen, everything feels small in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom .It's dutiful and earnest but it's never lively and rarely natural."
103,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"A Black story for a Black ensemble, well-made and true to the material."
104,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"Boseman's last performance is a marvel of enthusiasm and detailed invention, with Levee's final outburst the polar opposite of this actor's generosity."
105,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,...a somewhat stagy yet mostly captivating drama...
106,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"It not only illustrates a biographical fragment of Ma Rainey's short career and a tribute to the jazz era, but also uses her image to dialogue behind closed doors with relevant topics about racism, injustice and segregation. [Full review in Spanish]"
107,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"Boseman is a marvel from his high-spirited intro, shoes first, to his shockingly vulnerable confession monologue, to his rage against both the white man and God, and on through to his inevitable exhausted defeat."
108,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,"For a film named after a groundbreaking blues icon, Ma Rainey frustratingly gets very little screen time."
109,ma_raineys_black_bottom,critics,fresh,p,The sense that we're beholden to the whims of unseen forces-that we're not the protagonists of our own stories-cuts deep in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.
110,ma_raineys_black_bottom,audience,3.5,p,The ensemble are a force and keep you engaged from beginning to end.
111,ma_raineys_black_bottom,audience,2.5,n,There's nothing happening here
112,ma_raineys_black_bottom,audience,3.5,p,"I cannot deny that both Chadwick and Viola Davis deliver excellent performances that's both thought provoking and tragic. My problem with this movie is that it feels like a stage play and not a cinematic masterpiece. Don't get me wrong, the costuming and make-up is great, but the fact that the entire movie takes place in a very contained space, and that the actors deliver several long monologues throughout the movie, make it feel very unnatural. Still, the acting is brilliant and I would probably not have seen the play so I am happy I saw the movie."
113,ma_raineys_black_bottom,audience,3.0,p,"Forget the botched Oscars, Chadwick Boseman's performance is great in this and it shows his full range, filled with charisma. Viola Davis is also a powerhouse, and the two of them carry this otherwise fairly typical film to greater heights. Films set in this era should trigger some emotion, especially given the moment, and in that regard, it hits all the right notes."
114,ma_raineys_black_bottom,audience,5.0,p,"A classic with the late Chadwick Bozeman and Great Viola Davis complementing the performance of each other, not excluding the above excellent performances from Glynn Truman, Colman Domingo and Michael Potts………👌🏽"
115,ma_raineys_black_bottom,audience,3.5,p,"I wasn't expecting a ""bottle episode"" kind of movie. Strong performances from the two leads, and by the end of it it's pretty clear that was taken from a play even if, like me, you didn't know that at the beginning."
116,ma_raineys_black_bottom,audience,4.0,p,"n just a bit over 90 minutes of runtime, we witness powerhouse performances, listen to a well-crafted screenplay, and contain more knowledge of Black culture while also seeing the social injustices and racism that unfortunately, is still at large in today's time. 

What must be recognized first is Ruben Santiago-Hudson talent in writing. Every minute of dialogue, especially in the band room scenes, becomes better and better as the minutes flow by, evoking a different emotion each time.

She received an Oscar once and may she receive it again, Viola Davis brings Ma to life, blowing you away every minute she's on screen. Alongside Ma, here comes Levee. A special soul gone too soon, this is Chadwick Boseman's best and it is a true heartbreak we won't be experiencing his talent anymore. 


Like I stated before, here comes Levee. Levee is a character that sticks to our minds. A man who is not afraid of the white man but sadly cannot escape the white man. We see this in several aspects such as the story of his mother, the finally-broken door which leads to nowhere, and the tragic incident with Toledo. 

On the lines of Levee, let's touch on jelly roll. Learning the ending was not in August Wilson's play, it establishes itself as a significant and important addition. The group of white men singing Levee's song that Sturdivant bought when he shoved $5 into Levee's shirt pocket like he was doing him a favor, is the symbol of Black musicians and artists' works being seized by white artists. There is still not much credit or truth to where certain music originated from. 

If you have read this far and have not jumped on the Ma train, do it as soon as possible."
117,ma_raineys_black_bottom,audience,2.5,n,"Anchored by two excellent central performances from the late Chadwick Boseman and Viola Davis, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, unfortunately, doesn't quite sell itself as a film. Based on a stage play, the film suffers from its own origins, and doesn't fully work in film format, in the way that another film on this list does. Still, the performances are superb, and Boseman, in one of his last screen roles is not to be bet against for a posthumous Oscar. It's a film that also suffers from its own claustrophobia, although the film takes place in just a few rooms, which is fine, it's a relief on the couple of occasions the camera does venture outside, and you can almost taste the fresh air. That's both a compliment and a criticism, it's a testament to the performances that I felt this way, but I wished it was a little less stagey. It's worth a watch though, and it's available on Netflix."
118,ma_raineys_black_bottom,audience,4.5,p,"I’m not familiar with the stage production, but that feel is retained in this excellent film. Solid performances all around and good cinematography."
119,ma_raineys_black_bottom,audience,4.0,p,"Sin duda, esta historia tiene un guion super original. Donde no se enfocan en contar una sola historia. Sin no un conjunto de ellas que al principio parece que no tienen nada que ver entre si, y conforme avanza la historias todas las mini historias se unen entre si para darle cara a la historia principal de la película. Otra cosa que resalta de la película es su increíble fotografía y vestuario. Cada momento de la historia se puede apreciar su detalle y cuidado de estos dos elementos. Tanto que en la fotografía a pesar de que casi toda la película prácticamente se desarrolle en un set, la importancia de esta hace que el escenario parezca que se une a los sentimientos de los personajes. Una película super recomendable."

Once again Pixar displays their ability to tell a great story without using a word. Post that eleven and a half minute mark the film doesn't live up to that opening, it isn't bad, just not as great. The voice acting is well done, but no real standouts. The animation from Pixar is again terrific. This film succeeds in invoking a sense of awe, adventure, comedy and in the end will warm your heart. Highly recommended movie, go check it out!"
145,up,audience,4.0,p,One of the few times I've been in a movie theater where it went totally silent. That beginning montage starts so happy and ends so heartbreaking all with the same tune just slowly morphing into a slower more somber version was brilliant. All you could hear in that silence of the theater was sniffling. A wonderful heartwarming tale of the grouchy old man and the enthusiastic young kid meshed so well together. The only thing I didn't like was that it kind of dragged in the middle.
146,up,audience,4.0,p,"A movie that a lot of people hold it on high regards but I have never had that feeling. Yes, the opening scene is phenomenal and the humor is good and emotions are flourished  like any other Pixar film but I kind off disconnected with it sometimes but that's just my personal opinion."

151,lady_bird,critics,fresh,p,"Though Lady Bird is a coming-of-age story with familiar tropes such as prom night and a disappointing first sexual experience, it's really a film about teenage aspiration."
152,lady_bird,critics,fresh,p,Saoirse Ronan's stunning portrayal of adolescence is completely lacking in vanity.
153,lady_bird,critics,fresh,p,"There are many films that try to remind older audience members how it feels to be young, albeit in a superficial way. It reminds us of the real struggles of adolescence while at the same time providing great insight into the challenges of parents..."
154,lady_bird,critics,fresh,p,"Not only incredibly authentic - perhaps cringingly so - but also marginally profound, even as its scope stays strictly on the almost unsubstantial life of a teenager."
155,lady_bird,critics,fresh,p,Lady Bird flies high on heartwarming yet tough honesty.
156,lady_bird,critics,fresh,p,"With Lady Bird, Greta Gerwig manages to take the old coming-of-age genre and make it feel refreshing with its authenticity and heart."
157,lady_bird,critics,fresh,p,Greta Gerwig nails her solo directorial debut in this semi-autobiographical coming-of-age tale where Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf's mother-daughter scenes bleed with authenticity.
158,lady_bird,critics,fresh,p,"[It's] brought to fruition by a wonderful cast . . . namely Ronan and Metcalf, whose push-pull dynamic of blossoming and established worldviews encapsulate the insecurities of growing up."
159,lady_bird,critics,fresh,p,"Being witness to Lady Bird's growth is a beautiful experience. Not only are you enchanted by her story, but you also learn something about yourself. [Full review in Spanish]"
160,lady_bird,critics,fresh,p,"There is something for all ages to identify with and you will find yourself torn between the generations, but ultimately feeling great affection for all of the characters. This film is a success because of the exceptional writing from Greta Gerwig."
161,lady_bird,critics,fresh,p,"[The film] is good, but overrated. Curiously, its faults are also overrated, in that many are characteristic of its genre."
162,lady_bird,critics,fresh,p,"The way Gerwig captures the stages of adolescence makes this coming-of-age film more honest than poignant. It shows that not only she is a good actress, but also a great filmmaker. [Full review in Spanish]"
163,lady_bird,critics,fresh,p,"Marion and Lady Bird's bond is very real, strong, and complicated like many mother-daughter bonds tend to be."

165,lady_bird,critics,fresh,p,A stupendously acted and immeasurably poignant ode to the realistic bonds and barbs of life as a high school senior.
166,lady_bird,critics,fresh,p,"I am awfully fond of it. This film isn't for me, but it doesn't have to be. Someone out there is going to see this film for the first time. Its heartfelt, goofy, and ever-so-slightly twee wavelength will seem to be made just for them..."

169,lady_bird,critics,fresh,p,"Taking the trip with [Lady Bird] is a joy, and the cast and filmmaker taking us there create a singular, authentic experience that will place Lady Bird on the list of most memorable, enjoyable coming of age films."
170,lady_bird,audience,4.5,p,Saoirse Ronan!!!! always love her Performances! the comedy in this movie tied with Drama really is what keeps your attention the writing is so full and relatable to following a conversation of a mother and daughter having a conversation and some things being unsaid because of how much you know each other. The images are dreary yet light. leaves you wanting more! Love this movie!
171,lady_bird,audience,4.5,p,"Smart, sensible, and sweet, Greta Gerwig's Lady Bird is a coming-of-age dramedy unlike any other. Metcalf, Ronan, Letts, and Hedges are the standouts. But the biggest stand out is the cinematography which portrays an excellent color palette of California suburbs in the early 2000s."
172,lady_bird,audience,4.0,p,"Really well done movie. Nicely paced (comes in at only 93 min!), well cast and very well acted. I cannot really relate to the story (but do you really need to relate to every movie that's good? I think not)."
173,lady_bird,audience,4.5,p,"A meticulously directed slice of life film, that flawlessly captures the issue of being a teenager. Lady Bird doesn't have a substantial plot point, it's a perfectly accurate representation of life."
174,lady_bird,audience,2.5,n,"I personally felt that the movie was overrated and not nearly as good as it was made out to be. And while I can see why the film would be well received by teenagers in american small towns, it was too much of a wanna-be hip movie with cutesy punchlines to be anything special. It's not Greta Gerwig's fault that she's in a relationship with Noah Baumbach or that she has beautiful boobs - if anything it's her fault that she's avoiding open and much needed discussions in real life which stands in contrast to her trying to stay something here as a filmmaker but also shows why she failed in doing so and creating something truly meaningful - and the favourable reviews she received for this movie seemed to be more about that, besides the fact that most people stop forming their own opinions when something looks like it is ""liked"" by everyone else."
175,lady_bird,audience,4.0,p,esta película muestra una mirada realista de la adolescencia
176,lady_bird,audience,4.5,p,"Greta Gerwig's 2017 coming-of-age dramedy ‘Lady Bird' is a heart-warming solo directorial debut that tackles the trials and tribulations of being a teenager and family relationships. Nominated for a plethora of awards, including Best Picture and Best Actress at the 2018 Academy Awards, ‘Lady Bird' features commendable performances from both Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf. The film can be seen as a billet doux to both Gerwig's hometown of Sacramento, California (where the film takes place), and Gerwig's younger self as the director drew some aspects of the film from her own coming-of-age experience. 

Saoirse Ronan stars in the titular role, bringing Christine ‘Lady Bird' McPherson to life. Ronan gives an incredible performance as the head-strong teen as Lady Bird deals with the baggage that comes along with being a teenager. Including applying for colleges, friendships and sex. Although it's not explained where Lady Bird gets her unusual name from in the film, the title is just one of the ways she shows defiance to her mother Marion (Metcalf). Opposite Ronan, playing Lady Bird's mother, is Laurie Metcalf. The Emmy-nominated actor gives an exemplary performance as an overworked nurse, whose candid demeanour results in frequent arguments with her daughter. But within the moments she's not disagreeing with her daughter, Gerwig explores their complex mother/daughter relationship.

‘Booksmart' star Beanie Feldstein stars as Lady Bird's best friend Julie, who's shy, reserved personality contrasts to Lady Bird's. Lucas Hedges and Timothée Chalamet both play Lady Bird's short-lived lovers. But like any high-school romance, the boys are complete opposites – Hedges' character Danny is a wholesome theatre kid and Chalamet's character Kyle is the anti-capitalist cool kid, and each relationship ends sooner rather than later. ‘Dune' star Stephen McKinley Henderson has a small role in the film as one of the school's priests. However, after it's revealed that his character is suffering from depression he isn't seen again.

‘Frances Ha' cinematographer Sam Levy reunites with Gerwig to provide the ‘Lady Bird' with aesthetically pleasing cinematography that, mixed with ‘Moonlight' colourist Alex Bickel's subtle colouring, gives ‘Lady Bird' is unique, saturated look. Gerwig's polished script, alongside the powerhouse performances from Ronan and Metcalf, captures the feeling of being a teenager and being a parent. The acclaimed director creates an atmosphere that shows how Lady Bird and her mother constantly walk the line between rowdy arguments and heartfelt moments. Despite being set in the early 2000s, the various anachronisms in the film, including car models and computers, can't help but take the viewer out of the 2002/03-time period where the film takes place. 

As well as being an emotional coming-of-age story, ‘Lady Bird' highlights the strength, fragility and the frustration within Lady Bird and her mother's relationship. Gerwig also calls attention to Lady Bird's growth. After the argument with her mother about Lady Bird not telling her mother that she'd been waitlisted for a school in New York, she finally calls her mother. But instead of calling herself the self-given nickname, she finally embraces her given name, calling herself Christine and leaving an emotional message for her mother as an attempt to reconcile. Embracing the name shows how she has finally grown up and out of the ‘Lady Bird' persona and accepting the responsibility that comes with being Christine.

‘Lady Bird' is a sentimental film that features picturesque cinematography and sensational performances from Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf. At its core, ‘Lady Bird' is a film about responsibility, family and finding who you are. The film is both an expression of Gerwig's love for her hometown and the main character's disdain for it as she longs to flee to the east coast."

207,knives_out,audience,4.5,p,"Writer/director Rain Johnson recovers following his divisive Star Wars film (personally, I enjoyed his darker Star Wars vision) with a wonderfully smart and witty murder mystery. With a stellar cast that includes Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, Christopher Plummer, and Daniel Craig as Detective Benoit Blanc (the lead of a soon to be film series), it's hard to imagine this film not being great. The set up is standard Agatha Christie with rich patriarch Plummer found dead and all of the family angling for his fortune being suspect. Although the set-up is standard, Johnson subverts murder mystery conventions, with the cause of death revealed early in the film, but best of all it's the audience who has all the facts and Daniel Craig's detective left in the dark. I don't want to spoil the story, but MINOR SPOILER ALTERT, much of the film's suspense boils down to the fate of a sympathetic protagonist. Overall, if you love a crackling good mystery or wonderful ensemble casts, don't miss this film. BONUS FILM SUGGESTION! If you enjoyed ""Knives Out"" you should check out Rain Johnson's first film as writer/director, ""Brick."" It's another wildly fun murder mystery, though it's in the mold of Raymond Chandler with a high school Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a noirish teenage Phillip Marlow."
208,knives_out,audience,4.5,p,"Knives out is a thrilling, dramatic and great movie that everyone should watch. This clearly shows how murder mystery movies should be. The story line up is very interessting to watch and the plot twist is what makes the movie so good, perhaps one of the best plot twists in a movie. Each of the actors deliver their roles perfectly and i love the dialogue in it. Great movie, can't wait for the sequel!

23,pans_labyrinth,audience,5.0,p,"Uma das fantasias mais espetaculares da história do cinema. É divertido, assustador, emocionante, completo."
24,pans_labyrinth,audience,5.0,p,"A magical world that only Guillermo Del Toro could imagine for us.

Guillermo Del Toro's legendary dark fantasy horror film Pan's Labyrinth (2006) is a wonder of impeccable filmmaking. From the haunting practical effects for The Faun to the terrifying Pale Man costume, Pan's Labyrinth provides a fantasy realm of magical creatures as well as a brutally realistic Spanish war drama. Guillermo's direction is staggering with his fascinating imagery, gorgeous visuals, childlike wonder, shocking depiction of war crimes, and scary monsters. The question he poses is really who are the true monsters in Pan's Labyrinth.

Guillermo's writing is fantastic with heartfelt empathy of his young heroine and sympathy for those lost in the war. You are always on edge as to what will happen next in Guillermo Del Toro's dark fantasy. Pan's Labyrinth is nothing like you've ever seen. I love how Guillermo has a young innocent girl witness atrocity after atrocity in quiet horror as we see as viewers how trauma forms in children during warfare.

Editor Bernat Vilaplana's cuts are so dreamy as scenes melt into one another for 118 minutes of wonder. Cinematographer Guillermo Navarro uses cool blues and greens for a mysterious and haunting look, while a warm and scary look for the war and horror sequences. I love the chilling close-ups on creatures, especially the Pale Man being disgusting. 

I adore The Fawn. He's my favorite film creature prosthetic with his mystical figure and Doug Jones' majestic movements and intriguing gestures. Jones gets you curious as The Fawn, so that he can terrify you as the Pale Man. I think Doug Jones deserved an Oscar for his enigmatic and enthralling Fauno alone, not to mention his unforgettable Pale Man. I loved child actress Ivana Baquero as the adorable and compelling Ofelia. You feel all her fear, wonder, and curiosity within Pan's Labyrinth.

Eugenio Caballero's production design creates a real fantasy world with his stellar sets. Pilar Revuelta and Laura Musso's set decoration is fabulous with wood and leaves to adorn Guillermo's fantasy land with realistic things. Everett Burrell's visual effects are some of film's finest ever with believable wounds and strange creature enhancements. Composer Javier Navarrete's score astounds me every time I hear his haunting melodies that create a magical fantasy world with his mystic sounds. I could listen to Pan's Labyrinth's score on its own, it's that wondrous. 

Lala Huete and Rocío Redondo's costume design is phenomenal with realistic war uniforms to inspired creature outfits. The make-up for The Fawn and the Pale Man is truly outstanding work from artists José Quetglás, Montse Ribé, and David Martí.

In conclusion, Pan's Labyrinth is one of cinema's greatest achievements with sterling craftsmanship, horrifying practical creatures, poignant war commentary, and emotional childlike wonder like few could genuinely understand like Guillermo. I simply adore Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth."

27,pans_labyrinth,audience,4.0,p,"One of the first fantasy movies I watched when I was a child, I was afraid of it because I didn't understood on that moment the story, but in their moment it was and still being a well- renowned movie with a great twist at the end, that takes place in the middle of a Spanish village and reflects life on that time. No doubts, one of the best Gullermo de Toro's movie that can be rewatched a lot of times and still feeling fresh."
28,pans_labyrinth,audience,3.0,p,"An ok movie, but underwhelming. The ""reality-plot"" is predictable and unoriginal. The fantasy plot is not explored enough, and gets too little screen time."

La sceneggiatura è perfetta e di valore, ogni personaggio ha il suo scopo e le sue ambizioni, tutti aggiungono qualcosa al film.
Inoltre, grazie alle due storyline totalmente differenti, si riescono a solleticare nello spettatore numerose emozioni.

43,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"What sets Us apart from others in the genre, and likewise Peele apart from his contemporaries, is the voice that whispers a warning in every scene, a foreboding that follows you out of the theater and into your sleeping subconscious."

If you start to ask questions like ""Why do they have scissors?"" or wear red jumps suits when there are not wearing them in other parts etc... Wait till you can see it for free and then it might be worth it."
55,us_2019,audience,4.0,p,"A follow up by Jordan Peele completely beats the ""sophomore jinx.""  It is a horror film that that cites tropes and precedents of horror in order to deeply root the film in the terrain of pop culture and then pull up those roots."

Packed with gorgeous cinematography, and endless emotions it is a truly stunning achivement. I love how it shows what Korean life can be like on a farm in Arkansas, where the house is a raised mobile home, the film potrays this so well and just the event of moving. Movie also deals with sickness and loss in a beautiful detail. I defiently reccomend Minari."
84,minari,audience,4.5,p,Should have won best picture 9/10
85,minari,audience,4.0,p,The best Korean movie.
86,minari,audience,4.5,p,"This is a semi authobiographical film of Director Chung's upbringing.  A story about immigration and starting life in the United States, it rings true to it's present day as a Korean family plops onto an Arkansas farm.  It is modest and specific.  It presents childhood as authentic.  There is perhaps no film more American than this, despite it being almost entirely in Korean."
87,minari,audience,4.0,p,"When they say movies are a window into the lives of characters, or story or a peek into history, Minari is such a film. Image starting a life with limited resources, but dreaming big, in a place that doesn't dream big? Would you survive, or would you give up to fit in? Now, watch Minari, and you'll appreciate this simple tale of the family comes first storyline."
88,minari,audience,3.0,p,"Minari is great. It builds on lofty ideals to execute a deeply personal view of both a family, some characters, and the world they inhabit. It's devoid of most of the things you'd expect from a film with such lofty ambitions. It trades forward-thinking cultural commentary for a much more subtle, much more modest view of family, togetherness, and accepting things as they come. 

Some say that this film represents an American dream. And I think it's better to say that this is an American tragedy; those who have seen the film will likely agree. But those little tragedies that fill every life lead to a fulfilling whole. That whole is filled with life, all joys and problems combined into an ugly mess of something. What that ""something"" is will be unique to everyone, but this ""something"" exemplifies the uniqueness of so many different people.

Okay, that's lovely, poetic talk. But this doesn't explain why the film is great. And in a lot of ways, it's premise is its downfall. It is modest almost to a fault. It's so diligently exploring this one, tiny example of reality that it really takes the power of the entire film to carry it across the finish line. While the score is and directing is fantastic, the drama on display simple and stern, and the overall execution fine, it definitely feels like a film that is doing its best to wrap up into a cohesive whole. It stumbles, very similarly to the family in the story; Minari can be very unclean, and obtuse at times. You might be looking for that meaning the film is obviously trying to communicate, but it can seem elusive, as if the film is trying to hide itself from you as a viewer.

But this film is for the climax. The film may meander throughout its second act, but its third act is a beacon, really grabbing you as a viewer and captivating you with the excellent performances of the actors. It's able to wrap up all its themes in fantastic fashion. Does that make up for its confusing arc, just because the conclusion is good? That's debatable. But you can't argue results, once you get to the end of everything.

In the end, Minari is a messy and confusing film, but one that is worth the time. It is certainly unique, and definitely hits the mark it was aiming for. The form may leave a lot to be desired, but the execution is all that matters."
89,minari,audience,5.0,p,"An arrestingly tranquil motion picture, that at the same time is as powerful as all the performances in it. Chungs' 2020 feature debut brims with bright sunshine and blue moonlight, a stunning look at the American dream."

92,the_mitchells_vs_the_machines,critics,fresh,p,"The movie is filled with an imaginative mix of modern and old-fashioned, campy, two-dimensional animation with additional camp references. A lively soundtrack of pop tunes and numerous other funny cultural references spice up the movie."
93,the_mitchells_vs_the_machines,critics,fresh,p,"The weirdness is an affect, but the affection, creativity, and energy of this film are not. One of the best films of 2021."
94,the_mitchells_vs_the_machines,critics,fresh,p,First-time feature director Michael Rianda brings together a deeply touching story about familial differences and does so with the renegade spirit that keeps original animation one of our most sacred spaces for unbridled creativity.

111,the_mitchells_vs_the_machines,audience,5.0,p,"The Mitchells vs. The Machines - 10/10. Mike Rianda directs this wonderfully packed family film with amazing animation and wonderful storytelling. When the aspiring college bound daughter is about to leave to school, the father of the family decides the gang should spend one last vacation together before she heads off. Just as they set off to drop her off at her college cross country, an evil update on all smart devices happens, which causes a robot apocalypse. How the Mitchells try to survive the ordeal, whilst also building a better bond within the family, makes for the rest of the film's plot. It follows suit with other recent Phil Lord and Chris Miller productions like Spiderman Into The Spiderverse and The Lego Movie, which mixed excellent animation with great family fun! And this movie does that too, never boring you and also giving something to look forward to for anyone in any age demographic. The movie is a perfect example of making a usually adult theme (end of the world situation) and making it accessible for the family format. The action is fun, the movie is actually pretty funny, and the emotional scenes are super effective. Each character is fleshed out well, with each bringing an interesting dynamic towards the films adventure. Also, the movie features an incredibly adorable and hilarious #dog, which happens to be one of the best animated animal characters in recent times. The movie also has a great commentary on how technology is super dangerous when trying to be advanced in an unnatural way. A well layered, and well intentioned family film!"
112,the_mitchells_vs_the_machines,audience,4.5,p,Laughed so much watching this with the family. I highly recommend it.
113,the_mitchells_vs_the_machines,audience,4.5,p,"A splendid modern take on the ever-relevant issue of the difficulty of family relations. It's reminiscent of ""A Goofy Movie"" to be honest, and this, let admit it, is a high praise. It's fun to see how old and tired tropes of animated storytelling are being adapted into this modern times of ours and used to explore new and exciting themes. The portrayal of Mitchells is here often quite realistic, to the point that they feel like an actual family – not from a cartoon, but from the real life. This is superbly juxtaposed to a heartfelt, enjoyable mess of a robot apocalypse that is the setting for the larger part of this feature. All in all, the movie strikes a perfect balance between the goofy (no pun intended, of course), fantastical tale of saving the world and the lesson about very real problems we each have in our families. Definitely worth a watch, I think."

128,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,I'll just come out and say it. Parasite is a masterpiece.
129,parasite_2019,critics,rotten,n,The film feels too insincere and hypocritical to take genuinely seriously on its theme of social injustice.
130,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Boon Joon Ho keeps us thoroughly enthralled as the story unfolds, deftly calibrating shifts in tone between satire, screwball farce, black comedy and horror, and also nimbly balancing our sympathies between the two families."
131,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,"A splendid take on class inequalities that force the audience to question who is the parasite, the rich or the poor."
132,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Not content with a basic premise of crime and punishment, director Bong Joon Ho goes a step further, eventually corkscrewing off on a tangent that drags out the running time."
133,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Precisely controlled and drolly ironic in tone even as its events grow more and more berserk, Parasite is always entertaining, foremost."
134,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,Every actor brings different nuances to their respective portrayals and is completely in sync with the picture's seriocomic tone.
135,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,Bong's work was leading to this galvanizing movie which has really shocked people into further questioning the wealth gap and understanding the precariousness of the urban underclass in an era of climate change...
136,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,"One of the best films of the decade and of Korean cinema (a nation that, by the way, has one of the most interesting filmographies of contemporary times). Its greatest strength is telling a story small but so powerful... [Full review in Spanish]"
137,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Bong's film is one which reveals itself in layers and it's almost impossible to categorise - it's at once a black comedy, thriller, horror, family drama and an allegory about class."
138,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,An unusual director with his antenna attuned to social class...Bong has emerged over the past decade as a globally significant filmmaker.
139,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,Parasite was the single best film I saw in 2019.
140,parasite_2019,audience,5.0,p,"Summary: Ki-woo's parents are unemployed and trying to make ends meet. After his friend refers him to an affluent family seeking a tutor, Ki-woo tells a white lie about his qualifications and lands the job. Pretty soon, his family members are conveniently landing jobs as well!

Takeaways: A unique thriller that left my heart racing, but for different reasons than most films. Fascinating characters + white lies = eerie fates. P.S. Don't let the Korean language dissuade you. Reading the subtitles doesn't take away the suspense or strangeness of the film."
141,parasite_2019,audience,3.5,p,Strange little movie but enjoyable. Well acted .
142,parasite_2019,audience,5.0,p,"It takes the orignal plot and turns it on it's head, and I loved the way it worked giving a great message and keeping us engaged."
143,parasite_2019,audience,5.0,p,"amazingly metaphorical, top tier cinematography, top tier acting, literally life changing, probably one of the best movies of all time"
144,parasite_2019,audience,5.0,p,The best Korean movie.
145,parasite_2019,audience,5.0,p,"South Korea has an answer for M. Night Shyamalan. That answer is Bong Joon-ho. Bong Joon-ho and his masterpiece Parasite has so much nuance moments in the film especially with the tone shifts. What I loved the most about the tone shift in this film was when the doorbell rang, the main characters get into deeper trouble then they thought with a hint of a twist. The music is beautiful, the writing is brilliant, and the intense scenes during the climax are just miraculous. Parasite is such an extraordinary that will be talked about for years to come."
146,parasite_2019,audience,2.0,n,Didn't really udnerstand the ending or why the father did what he did. Odd movie.
147,parasite_2019,audience,5.0,p,"Too little can be added to talk about this film, so I'll just reaffirm what we've heard millions of times: ""Parasite"" is a masterpiece wih no comparison."
148,parasite_2019,audience,3.5,p,"Warning: SPOILERS
It's possible that I watched this movie with my expectations too high. The way most critics wrote about this movie I was literally expecting something mind blowing. Well… it was…good.
The first hour or so was really barely okay. This involved the poor family infiltrating the rich family by taking over the servants' jobs. Honestly, I normally wouldn't have made it through that first hour, but surely SOMETHING mind blowing was coming right?
Well, not really. The rest of the movie was quite gripping at times. I really felt for the father of the poor family when he murdered the father of the rich family. That was Avery powerful scene.
So add up a barely mediocre first half with a really good, but not great second half, and.., I don't get it? Is there something I'm missing here?"
149,parasite_2019,audience,5.0,p,"Brilliant, amazing premise and execution, incredible immersive direction, cinematography, and editing. One of my favourite movies for this decade."
150,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"What Jackson's storytelling lacks in coherency - a major problem for non-Tolkienites with the first film - he makes up for with a new-found sense of urgency and a richer blend of drama, humour and human emotion."
151,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"In terms of battle sequences alone, it's hard to find one that's quite as daunting and absorbing as the Battle for Helm's Deep in The Two Towers..."
152,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,The climactic battle of Helm's Deep - though it still leaves much to be resolved for the final part - is a breathtakingly colossal skirmish in the rain and mud and fog.
153,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"Call it a pretty good film and I'll agree with you. Call it a great one, and I will beg to differ."
154,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,It also has... layers of political dynamics going on which I actually thought was pretty interesting.
155,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,The Two Towers succeeds like few other middle installments do in serving as both a satisfying benchmark that ties the introduction and conclusion to this trilogy together.
156,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,I think this one might be the actual best of the franchise and it's all because of the Ents.
157,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,this three hour epic is one of those few films where you leave feeling they could have spent even more time with story explanation and exposition
158,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,These Tolkien films have a weight and seriousness that very few sword-and-sorcery pictures of the past 30-odd years have attained.
159,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,What an eyeful it is. This is probably the greatest battlepiece composed for the screen since Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible.
160,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"This film is a towering achievement, and the next installment can't come soon enough."
161,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"This is, I can say without fear of exaggerating, one of the great films of all time."
162,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"Much of the movie is exciting. But none of it is as satisfying as what Jackson was able to create in Fellowship, the first film."
163,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"While the acting is once more solid throughout, even with the Shakespearean Ian McKellen given too little to do as the good wizard Gandalf, the most impressive performance of all comes from digital magicians who created the wretched Gollum, Smeagol."
164,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,rotten,n,The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is like being trapped in a nerd's bedroom.
165,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"While some people think this surpasses the original, I don't. The storylines are fractured and geographically and narratively it's sometimes hard to figure out what's going on... but the positives are many."
166,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"The Two Towers is a satisfying and wholly gripping drama in its own right. Inevitably, Janus-like, it looks back to the Shire, and forward to the hour of doom. And after three hours, you will too."
167,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"When Gandalf arrives with reinforcements, descending a near-vertical slope using horses where you or I would use snowboards, the spirit of triumphant rampage is something rarely glimpsed since the days of Olivier and Henry V."
168,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"To live up to expectations, The Two Towers only had to be as good as its predecessor -- and, astoundingly, it's better."
169,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"Most moviegoers will leave buzzing about the climactic Battle of Helm's Deep. But in my eyes, this is Gollum's show more than anyone else's, even the special-effects wizards behind the scenes."
170,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,audience,4.0,p,"A perfect continuation of the story, characters develop and sets up a final chapter you are begging to see."
171,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,audience,5.0,p,"Best sequel of all times, wow!!!"
172,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,audience,4.5,p,"Being a purist who's read the book at least 15 times, I might not be able to give anything related to it five stars, but this film comes as close as anything probably ever will. There are some scenes that are so astounding as to boggle the mind. The acting is mostly perfect, and the story is rousing and emotionally resonant. I give is 95%, just like the other two installments. It's a great achievement."
173,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,audience,5.0,p,"Simple perfect, solid show."
174,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,audience,0.5,n,"Bit of a nonsense really, suits under 12s. Poor plot points, horrible acting, and unnecessary scenes dropped in."
175,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,audience,5.0,p,Simply the best movie !
176,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,audience,5.0,p,"Though not as good as the original, ""The Two Towers"" is still a masterpiece that continues the journey of Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, etc. with much more at stake, introducing new and memorable characters that are played perfectly due to the outstanding casting choices. The ending is very emotional, and ends off on yet another cliffhanger that keeps viewers excited to see the conclusion."
177,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,audience,4.0,p,Not often does a trilogy hold up so well
178,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,audience,5.0,p,"The story continues as Frodo and Sam reluctantly ally with Villian Gollum, (Andy Serkis in a CGI-fied but brilliant performance) Aragorn and the Others get unexpected new Allies, a beloved Character returns from the dead, and an epic battle at the Helms deep stronghold (complete with rain) takes place. Plus a skateboarding Elf, and a cocky Dwarf have an orc killing contest. It’s a really great second film, though it gets overlooked sometimes compared to the first and the third films."
179,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,audience,5.0,p,Wonderful journey. It brings a new world to people.
180,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,It's told with so much humor and heart.
181,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,"If you're expecting a straightforward biography of Mister Rogers, you might be disappointed...if, however, you hope to be inspired by a story about the way Mister Rogers still affects the world today, you will love this film."
182,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,"It's an airtight little fable of fingers linked in a gesture of friendship, one to one to one and on and on and on forever. Start small, with whomever is standing in front of you, and work from there."
183,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,It's a typically reliable turn from the two-time Oscar winner and he carries the movie.
184,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,"Make sure you've got your tissues, then dig out the companion documentary Won't You Be My Neighbour? and the 1998 article that inspired it all. You can thank me later."
185,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood pays tribute to Fred Rogers in an understated and heartfelt way that he would surely appreciate.
186,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,A quietly moving retort to modern cynicism.
187,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,The movie is quite a bit riskier than you might expect from a biopic about Mr. Rogers.
188,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,rotten,n,Viewers will surely never get lost in the performance; it's always obvious that Hanks is playing a part (though he's thoroughly watchable in every scene).
189,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,"""It has been crafted into something unique between being moving and heartbreaking"""
190,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,To say this hits all the right notes would be an understatement.
191,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,Without a doubt [Tom Hanks] was the best candidate to play Rogers in this pleasant but predictable film about kindness. [Full review in Spanish]
192,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,"Even if it doesn't inspire you to be the Mister Rogers you want to see in the world, it should hopefully serve as a reminder to be kind even when it's hard to."
193,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,"The film's strangeness makes this convincing, and it's what saves it from gooeyness. One of the most unexpected and evocative scenes in any film last year is in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood."
194,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,"A film that, like the interesting director and writer Marielle Heller's previous works... investigates the soul of its characters with a special affection, despite showing their weaknesses and imperfections without any shame. [Full review in Spanish]"
195,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,"Under any other director, this could have been a misguided misstep. But here, as a fitting tribute to Fred Rogers' legacy, with all of its quirky ingenuity and resolute application, just illustrates how truly special this film is."
196,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,"In an interesting twist, the director depicts ""Mr. Rogers"", as a secondary character [Full Review in Spanish]"

200,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,audience,5.0,p,Tom Hanks brings all the Nostalgia you could ever ask for. really brought out the Man we all know in Mr. Rogers a tear Jerker having grown up with Mr. Rogers. Loved a brief  moment of not keeping My attention but still highly recommend this movie.
201,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,audience,5.0,p,Beautifully delivered in every way. Must see!
202,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,audience,4.5,p,mr rogers is a good exaple.how people react to people.it is a lovely movie
203,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,audience,4.0,p,Great story about the life of Mr Fred Rogers.
204,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,audience,5.0,p,"The most splendid and beautiful movie about a wonderful man who ""got it"". Love, it makes the world go round. Whenever one is struggling, find forgiveness and love. Love others and self. Thank you Mr Rogers for being a bright light in this magical thing we call life."
205,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,audience,5.0,p,"A beautiful,  sweet, well placed film. And it has perfect acting by Tom Hanks,  of course.

This movie is quite a change from big superhero blockbusters. Yet it still portrays a real life super hero."
206,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,audience,4.0,p,I thought it was very well done.  It was interesting how it told us about Fred Rogers mostly in the context of his interaction with the journalist Tom Junod.
207,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,audience,5.0,p,"This movie could not be any better.
An outstanding performance by everyone in a superbly well crafted movie."
208,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,audience,4.0,p,"I can't think of anyone else who could have embodied this role so magnificently as Tom Hanks.  I grew up watching Mr. Rogers, and found this to be such a moving and uplifiting take on not just who he was, but the impact he had on others."
209,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,audience,3.5,p,"Idk, once you've seen the real Mr. Rodgers once no one can do him justice not even Tom Hanks."
0,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,But the bigger problem with the film is that it suffers from the girlboss-ification of female characters that has seeped into media over the few years.
1,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,A fabulous director and two awesome stars battle their way through a wonky script.
2,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,"While it improves in the second half, Black Widow is too uneven and generic to recommend. Telling a story about freewill and liberation is ironically littered with too many artistic compromises."
3,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Fun, funny, and frenetic without being overwhelming. [Full Review in Spanish]"
4,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Johansson is good, better than she's been given the opportunity to be before with this role, but she - like Black Widow is still stunted in many ways by the vision the MCU has for Natasha which makes this feel more elegiac than energetic."
5,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Marvel finally releases the Black Widow origin story, but how many more years before we see another one?"
6,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Natasha deserved a better memorial.
7,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Bland spy hooey. Although Pugh is a standout.
8,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Black Widow is worth seeing for Florence Pugh, the free-fall action sequence, and anything involving Taskmaster before it's revealed who is under the mask. The film mostly feels like it was done better by the films it was supposedly influenced by."
9,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,The rawness made for a spirited episode that every Marvel fan needs to listen to.
10,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"It would've been amazing to receive this movie 4 years ago, now it's just too late. That doesn't mean it's not a worthy closure for a much beloved character. [Full review in Spanish]"
11,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,The positives do outweigh the negatives but it does frustratingly end up feeling middle-of-the-road in terms of the MCU output.
12,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Black Widow is not as tedious and self-serious an entry as some of them. But that is setting the bar low.
13,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,What ensues is a film that isn't interested in planting seeds for future Marvel movies -- which is actually a refreshing change of pace.
14,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Pugh is the only victory for this vanilla Marvel movie. [...] Fans are left wondering what could have been. And Johansson is left fighting a lawsuit against the world's biggest entertainment behemoth - a mission that seems too much even for Natasha.
15,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Black Widow achieves the unthinkable and dethrones Thor: The Dark World as the worst film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
16,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,"The spotlight should firmly be on her, or so you would have thought, but for all its acrobatic female kick-ass baddery poor old Natasha Romanoff has to share that limelight with her highly skilled ""family"" to bring down the patriarchy."
17,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Almost completely lacking in Black Widow is any sense of outrage over the grotesque violations of human rights and human dignity at the root of the whole premise of the film.
18,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,"The problem with Black Widow is that the whole ordeal feels like an obligatory afterthought, simply going through the motions with only a perfunctory sense of charm."
19,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Black Widow has everything going on: dysfunctional families, sibling rivalry, a fatuous Russian superhero, a cackling Bond villain and an army of female assassins. What more do you want?"
20,black_widow_2021,audience,1.0,n,Boring and irrelevant story. Attempts at Russian accents were distracting throughout. Relying too much on a VFX heavy ending to the point where it was too much / action was too unbelievable at the end even for a film like this.
21,black_widow_2021,audience,5.0,p,o que mas me convenceu foi a trajetória na viúva Negra. a o gancho de ramificações para novo heróis. foi incrível.
22,black_widow_2021,audience,1.5,n,"The most generic, predictable and boring movie I've seen from the MCU in a long time, something very forgettable that is sustained in the pure participation of its actors, in that case I would have paid for a family sitcom with Scarlet Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbor and Rachel Weisz."
23,black_widow_2021,audience,3.5,p,"Pretty good, the younger sister does a great job.  The movie is full of light-hearted family dynamics that are funny.  Scarlet did a great job the problem was with Task Master.  Couple that with the flying or falling for like 30 mins really.  Step it up Marvel."
24,black_widow_2021,audience,4.0,p,"A long overdue, fantastic solo movie. Taskmaster was a bit of a missed opportunity, and the film can get slightly too ambitious at times. Neither of these complaints detract much from what is a very solid, satisfying examination of Natasha's past."
25,black_widow_2021,audience,1.5,n,"Uninteresting story, badly told, decently acted and horrendously edited"
26,black_widow_2021,audience,3.0,p,"Nothing new or inventive, but not every Marvel movie gets to be great. Some just need to check the boxes and fill out the time in between Spider-Man movies."
27,black_widow_2021,audience,2.5,n,"This movie came more than a decade too late. Also this is not a Black Widow movie, it's a movie to set up her replacement in the MCU.
Another predictable marvel movie that does nothing to push the envelope where the stars have plot armor and according to the laws of physic and basic biology should have died more than once. And that has some mindboggling weird plot choices. 
The acting was great but the only thing that kept me watching was Florence Pugh great and both emotional and funny performance."
28,black_widow_2021,audience,3.5,p,"This feels like a phase one movie - It's not bad at all, but that title sequence showed me that with a higher age rating it could have been one of the most interesting MCU movies, which does make the end product sting a little.
As it is - it's a decent MCU movie. The chemistry between the cast was great, the action was pretty good."
29,black_widow_2021,audience,3.5,p,Great action movie with many funny lines.
30,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"It's a good one. If you like Little Woman, the you'll love this interpretation."
31,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Even though it's been 25 years since Winona Ryder, Susan Sarandon, and Christian Bale delighted us in the last version of Little Women, this new version? Definitely worth seeing."
32,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"All the frilly dresses of Little Women's numerous film versions prevented me from accepted Louisa May Alcott's classic story as a pro-feminist creation, even when Katharine Hepburn played the lead. Writer-director Greta Gerwig changed that."
33,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Too many stitches in the narrative quilt, its often rushed sentiment suffocating the genuine moments of resonant emotion. But it does have a thing or two to say about love."
34,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,Gerwig's narrative proposal is modern and dynamic and gives her a fertile ground to reflect on the creative act and femininity with a subtlety that greatly enhances his discourse. The cast is superb in every way [Full review in Spanish]
35,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Why make another ""Little Women"" adaptation? Because we all needed Greta Gerwig's magical touch on this delightful tale. Gerwig taps into the same honest vulnerability she succeed in through her Oscar nominated film, ""Lady Bird""."
36,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"One of the best films of the year, it's a tonic for recent depressing events."
37,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,Gerwig's sumptuous film shows a modern audience that feminism and romance can fit together nicely...
38,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"To her credit, and to one's pleasant surprise, Gerwig does not attempt to inject contemporary identity politics into her film, at least not overly so."
39,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"With the high level of acting and a filmmaker proving her chops once again, these Little Women are well worth your time."
40,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"It has all the coziness and warmth one expects from this sort of nostalgic period drama, while also capturing the revolutionary spirit of Alcott's novel."
41,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"A rarity, an adaptation of an often told tale that manages a rethink while still holding true to what made the source material so beloved."
42,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,Rarely does an adaptation so steeped in the national consciousness and embedded in popular culture hit the right notes in the right order for the right audience at the right time.
43,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"These are good people doing their best, loving each other even through their mistakes, and that love emanates from the movie."
44,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Gerwig draws out the progressive strands in Alcott's original, emphasising its latent feminism."
45,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"A superb, well acted adaptation that solidifies Greta Gerwig as one of our greatest filmmakers, that Saoirse Ronan is one of our great actresses, and that Florence Pugh has a terrific career ahead of her."
46,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"[Greta Gerwig] brought a filmmaker's perspective to the story of the March sisters, as she put a meta spin on the proceedings that deviated from the source material ... but seemingly honoured who Louisa May Alcott ... was as a person"
47,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"There isn't a single false note in this tale, and that starts with the acting and goes all the way down to the production design, score, and costumes."
48,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,[Greta Gerwig] indeed offers a fresh spin by infusing her humanistic directorial voice while remaining loyal to the timeless story.
49,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,Little Women proves that Gerwig's directorial debut Lady Bird was no fluke - firmly confirming that she is a great filmmaker; a force to be reckoned with. It shines a new light on a classic story that retains the themes and drama that made it so.
50,little_women_2019,audience,5.0,p,I love the aesthetic and the acting in this movie

52,little_women_2019,audience,3.0,p,Not a bad adaptation with good characterisation in the actors of the March sisters.  However a choppy and confusing stop start storyline and a poor choice in actor for Laurie let's itself down badly. I tend to find it important that when characters are aged up it's important to do all the characters properly. After the time skip compared to the girls Laurie looks to young and it just makes Amy look like a cradle robber.
53,little_women_2019,audience,4.5,p,"This is one of the best movies I've watched... ever. I had to take half a star, though, because there was something plot-wise that I wish were... different."
54,little_women_2019,audience,3.5,p,"I liked everything about this movie except as follows: Emma Watson's acting wasn't very good (I know, I was surprised too)...and the time jumps were confusing to everyone that wasn't already familiar with the story."

57,little_women_2019,audience,4.0,p,"Entertaining.  Well done.  Seeing Saoirse Ronan & Emma Watson brought into sharp focus the difference in acting ""chops"" of these young women.  Emma should have hung it up after Harry Potter.  Saoirse is an enormous talent.  I think the story is a bit saccharin, but I think Greta Gerwig did a good job getting beyond that and making it interesting."
58,little_women_2019,audience,5.0,p,This movie so gorgeous and story so many emotion. my fellings when i watching it was unpredictable.You must see..
59,little_women_2019,audience,2.0,n,"I have several issues with this movie. If it's the first time experiencing this story, the out of order narrative would be confusing. The costumes and hair are too far off from being correct. I don't require exact historical accuracy, but they just took it too far with this one, especially Joe. I also don't understand why American actors could not be found to play the sisters, although Florence Pugh was lovely. I much prefer the 1994 version with Winona Ryder."

It's delightful and should be the textbook definition of adorable.  Like Jim Henson who decided to make his Sesame Street characters monsters so kids would not be afraid of monsters again, the people behind Monsters, Inc. have created monsters that even the shyest child will find unscary.  In fact, kids may decide multiple heads, removable eyes, and hair made from snakes are kind of cute."

84,monsters_inc,audience,5.0,p,"I have never had a monster before, and I truly wish I did so I could understand this film more"
85,monsters_inc,audience,5.0,p,I think that this movie has a amazing story about how you should love some one while you have them before they are gone forever. I also think it is a great Disney movie
86,monsters_inc,audience,4.0,p,"In this Pixar film, two monsters named Mike and Sully must protect a young human girl from an evil plot. In typical Pixar fashion they really up their game in the animation department with each film. In this movie you can see their improvement in the textures, specifically Sully's hair and their snow animation. The story here is great and the relationship between Sully and Boo, the young human girl, is the heart of the film. Randell, the antagonist, is voiced well by Steve Buscemi and is a threatening presence throughout the film. The very last scene of the movie always leaves me with the warm-fuzzies. Highly recommend you check this movie out!"
87,monsters_inc,audience,4.5,p,"For 2001:

PIXAR's fourth animated entry continued to prove the studio's passion for storytelling resonating with audiences 
'Monsters Inc' asks the question what if monsters were actually real and hid in our closets, not only that but actually lived in their own world working for a living?
Actors Billy Crystal and John Goodman play Sully and Mike, two best friends who work at a company called Monsters, Inc that specializes in collecting human children's screams to turn into clean dependable energy 
But the days are getting tougher with kids getting harder to scare and a scare shortage might be on the rise 
Sully is the top scarer competing with rival Randall 
Mike has a girlfriend Celia and the company is run by Mr. Waternoose 
Things change big time when a little human girl named Boo stumbles into the monster world thereby putting Sully and Mike in a bit of a pickle 
Moreover all monsters are lead to believe that a single touch from a human child is toxic 
But Boo bonds with Mike and Sully while at the same time they try to keep her avoid getting caught in a darker conspiracy 
PIXAR does it again with top-notch computer graphics, wonderful voicework, a really creative setup, nice monster designs being very distinguished, funny moments, and plenty of emotional ones too 
Sully and Mike are the best kind of duo buddies, Boo is so adorable tugging at the heartstrings, and the writers have the monsters fear something not from their world they don't quite understand 
A funny twist of us being scared of monsters but having them be scared of us in return 
I remember seeing it in the Adirondacks with my sisters and we were enamored 
The movie was another hit making over $800 million 
A perfect mix of pathos, humor, adventure, and heartbreak 
I like Jennifer Tilly as Celia and Steve Buscemi as Randall 
Im really glad too they put the movie as a level in Kingdom Hearts 3 
20 years later and the movie still leaves a big impact on our culture as well as animation fans even spawning a prequel, video games, and a recent Disney + tv series 
'Monsters Inc' is one of the earliest examples of children's entertainment that works telling a human story with non-human characters at the helm"
88,monsters_inc,audience,5.0,p,"Another certified Disney Pixar classic. It doesn't matter if this is a Halloween movie or not, all it matters is it's a great movie. 5/5"
89,monsters_inc,audience,4.0,p,A fun time. One of Pixar's hits.
90,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Chicken Run, if anything, offers an alternative to a desolate world that many of us are increasingly afraid of."
91,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,So great.
92,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Its plump chickens maintain that strange, haptic quality that makes you yearn to reach out and squeeze them."
93,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Even without Wallace and Gromit, most of the trademark joys are here: the compound of squashy creatures and heavy machinery, the wide, open-ended rictus of a toothy smile, and the great Parkian gulp."
94,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"It coaxes you to laugh and cry, flatters your intelligence, and practically guarantees a cheap night out: at dinner afterward, no one's going to be ordering anything but salad."
95,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,It's a warm-hearted and amusing entertainment that your children will enjoy.
96,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Chickens are inherently funny, like nature's idea of a very practical joke. Park and Lord have just improved the old rubber chicken gag, making it movable, turning it into something closer to who we are and what we know as humans."
97,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,Chicken Run is a charmingly conceived entertainment. But it's a little bit twee.
98,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,What gives this movie its oddly strong grip on a viewer's heart is a physical tenderness inseparable from the nature of claymation.
99,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"The claymation comedy Chicken Run is eggsactly what the doctor ordered. It's a witty, high-spirited adventure that will appeal to moviegoers of all ages. Call it chicken soup for the funny bone."
100,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"The first feature film from England's Aardman Animation, and the first truly terrific film to be released by DreamWorks."
101,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Most of the time Chicken Run entertains, instructs, involves and enchants."
102,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,Run to Chicken Run. This clay-animation comedy is the most entertaining animal story since Babe.
103,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"The film is brilliantly voiced across the board, with special notice to Mel Gibson as Rocky and Julia Sawalha as Ginger."
104,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"The sly, sardonic flight of fancy known as Chicken Run is a delightful epic of fowl deeds, quests for freedom and poultry heroics from the off-kilter English cartoon house, Aardman Animation."
105,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Like Wallace & Gromit, it's a paean to British eccentricity, equal parts cluelessness and hopefulness, full of English slang and dry Brit humor."
106,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Indeed, it's the best movie comedy to come out of England since Monty Python packed up the circus."
107,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Chicken Run contains some gorgeous, destined-to-be-classic set pieces, and this is where the Aardman production team flex their animation muscles."
108,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"It's nothing less than a stop-motion tour de force, bursting with charm, humor, invention and eye-popping mise en scene."
109,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"With its winking homages to films like Stalag 17 and The Great Escape, Run is visually inventive, its characters plump with personality and, for a bunch of chickens, ever so brave."
110,chicken_run,audience,4.0,p,"The voice acting is great, jokes smart, and great action sequences.  The movie uses animals as surrogates for our hopes and fears with the chickens running through one failed escape after another."
111,chicken_run,audience,3.5,p,"An amusing claymation-style stop-motion movie (similar to ""Wallace & Gromit"") about friendship, helping others in need and teamwork. With slapstick-style comedy, the film is fun for parents as well as kids."
112,chicken_run,audience,5.0,p,"Truly one of the defining cinematic works of our time—and no, this isn't some joke review.  Aardman carries the entirety of the claymation genre on its back, and rightly so.  The voice acting, the jokes, the plot, the SUBTEXT (yes, you heard me right, a G RATED MOVIE has a deeper subtext)...it's just stunning."
113,chicken_run,audience,2.0,n,something about this movie just makes me not like it
114,chicken_run,audience,5.0,p,"I used to watch it when I was a child. After 15 years, this movie is still fresh and enjoyable. The stop motion is amazing. Moreover, i found out this is an ecological and environmental reinterpretation of the Holocaust and it made me appreciate the movie even more"
115,chicken_run,audience,3.5,p,Clever story and funny to watch
116,chicken_run,audience,3.0,p,"While Chicken Run has a great animation style and compelling characters, the plot of the film was too generic and cliche for me."
117,chicken_run,audience,2.0,n,"I guess I'm part of the minority who isn't that impressed with the animation. The story is interesting and I get the holocaust parallels. But it just didn't keep my interest, even with the short run-time."
118,chicken_run,audience,3.0,p,"On one side we have chickens as symbols for humanity.
On the other side we have fried chicken, baked chicken, pineapple chicken, lemon chicken, coconut chicken, pepper chicken, chicken soup, chicken stew, chicken salad, chicken and potatoes, chicken burgers, chicken sandwich and chicken parmesan.
You get the idea."
119,chicken_run,audience,5.0,p,"This movie was already way ahead of it's time back when it was released. It's not the story of ""an america  rooster who falls in love with a British chicken"", it is literally the story of a group of women enslaved workers joining forces to escape a Nazi working camp
Spoilers:
This movie has simply amazing dynamics between women, be it friendship, disagreement, protection, union, hopelessness... and the story of their visionary leader, willing to sacrifice herself so that those she lead could experience freedom. Her friendship with Mac, a woman engineer, is heartwarming especially when they see the fruit of all their hard work: their plane is ready.
Rocky is your regular selfish overconfident man, that is, until his character development brings him to be honest, to not turn a blind eye to those suffering around him, to care, and ultimately to find the courage and dignity to join the chickens' cause. Over his character development, he also finally becomes worthy of the amazing woman (or hen) Ginger is."

122,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Claims for the eternal qualities of any music are dubious at best, but what Haynes exhibits through his own complex, textured documentary is that the Velvet Underground's music remains fertile ground for inspiration."

125,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,Haynes jettisons the traditional role of talking heads; he dispatches incidental music; he regards emotional arcs and sentimentality the way he might a toothache. He made a film that feels of a kind with the subject.
126,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,"What makes a rock band worth attending to a half century after its breakup isn't its personalities or backstory or context, interesting as those can be, and here they're all highly interesting. It's the music."
127,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,An artfully rendered and understandably chaotic account of the New York art scene of the 1960s.
128,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,The scene was well documented and the seemingly unlimited access Haynes and editors Alfonso Gonçalves and Adam Kurnitz had to the Warhol Foundation archives help paint a picture of an amphetamine-fuelled era.

132,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,"From the gorgeous gloom of V.U.'s debut with Andy Warhol and Nico to the dissonant pop-art audaciousness of their follow-up White Light/White Heat, the story is one of inspiration and evolution"
133,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,"It's not a great documentary, yet fairly informative and entertaining."
134,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,An audiovisual blast that delves into the creative combat that birthed America's first great avant-garde rock 'n' roll band.
135,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,Todd Haynes's excellent new documentary on legendary rock band the Velvet Underground reminds us of just how daring both music and film once was not that long ago.
136,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,"It's beautifully flawed, far too long, and deeply rewarding."

139,the_velvet_underground_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Haynes' dazzling visuals are grounded by interviews with the two living band members - most extensively John Cale, the Welshman and classically trained violist who formed a potent partnership with the Long Island-born Reed."
140,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,5.0,p,I love box office man
141,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,5.0,p,The definitive doc that in years to come will be inseparable from the bands legacy. Captures the essence and spirit of the band.
142,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,5.0,p,"Excellent documentary for Velvet Underground fans.   It discusses the band members fairly equally with a focus on what their motivations were, how they worked together, inspirations and their backgrounds.   Includes a good deal about Nico as well.  Great clips of Warhol and some of his art films, too. It will re-spark interest in their music if you hadn’t heard them in awhile. It almost  “takes you there” to the time period and captures it’s energy."
143,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,4.5,p,A pretty good documentary about one of my favorite bands and a favorite artist.
144,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,4.0,p,"Better than expected - it has a narrative but a little overlong, especially at the beginning. Lots about Lou as you might expect but little from him. He was difficult to interview l guess. Glad Mo Tucker got a shout out for After Hours. That deserved to be a big record, best flat singing ever (eat your heart out Morrissey). John Cale looks miles better now than in the day when he would walked it into Slytherin. Not sure how a non fan would like this. Nor am l really sure what the legacy is. Definitely Bowie. Moontans, skinny tight everything black and shades?"
145,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,3.5,p,"Highly recommended for anyone interested in the Velvets or the 1960s avant garde art/music scene, but might be a bit boring for others. Interesting/artsy use of video clips. Lots of old video/audio clips that have probably never been seen/heard by most viewers."
146,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,2.5,n,"The director of this documentary is obviously a huge fan of the late 60s avant garde movement in New York. While it was interesting to see what brought the band together, a little more time could have been spent on their later work. Most of the movie seemed more centred on Andy Warhol and his ilk, instead of the genius that Lou Reed and company brought to the table. Most of the focus is on the first two albums, then it seems like "" Oh then they made a couple of more successful albums and Lou Reed walked away. The end."""
147,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,5.0,p,"It gives a new whole perspective about the importance of The Velvet Underground. In addition to incredible unpublished footage, the film contextualizes the band's emergence within an effervescent avant-garde scene of the 50s and 60s in music (John Cale disciple of John Cage and La Monte Young), literature (Lou Reed linked to Allen Ginsberg and Delmore Schwartz ), visual arts (Warhol, etc.) and cinema (Jonas Mekas)."
148,the_velvet_underground_2021,audience,3.5,p,"The Velvet Underground is a pretty unique documentary. I didn’t know anything about the band going into this. The main reason I watched this is because I’m a big fan of Todd Haynes as a director. I was very curious to see what he’d bring to the documentary genre. I learned that the titular band was very experimental, and Haynes’ approach to the material fits that description. I loved the use of split screen, and the editing of the images worked very well. The film was at its best when it wasn’t afraid to diverge from what you typically see in a music documentary. Unfortunately, there were times where the film leaned into those cliches, with the typical talking heads structure and moving from album to album. I feel like this could’ve been amazing if it stuck to the weird montage style the entire time. Still, it’s a pretty interesting watch. Overall, I liked this. It packs a lot of information in 2 hours, and it’s definitely not a fast paced watch. But Haynes’ direction and the band themselves make it a worthwhile watch. If you love the band you’re probably watching regardless of what I say. But if you’re on the fence I say give it a watch if you like things that are more on the experimental side."

How was this made fucking 50 years ago and yet feels so ahead of its time? Cinematography and special effects that could perfectly fit a modern Sci-fi movie, a magestic score that even when the screen is all black it immerses you completely, and brilliant direction by non-other than Stanley.
Evolution is fucked up and Kubrick showed that in an amazing way.

That said, as amazing as his cinematography skills may have been; his ability to tell a story and direct were horrific. This could have been the perfect movie if turned over to an editor who knew how to shape a story."
177,2001_a_space_odyssey,audience,2.0,n,"My attention span could not handle the instrumental dramatic themes of this movie. Others consider this a masterpiece, I on the other hand was simply bored."
178,2001_a_space_odyssey,audience,4.0,p,"Okay I get that this is supposed to be one of the best movies ever made, but I think I saw this movie for the first time after seeing references to it - so much so that it detracts from the viewing experience of the source material. Stop great. Still impressive. Just doesn't have that magic."
179,raya_and_the_last_dragon,critics,fresh,p,Never anything but captivating. A visual beauty and a new kick-ass princess for fans of Disney too.
180,raya_and_the_last_dragon,critics,rotten,n,"While Disney has been getting slowly better about including a variety of characters and cultures, they are still stuck far in the past on creative storytelling. 'Raya' reads like an '80s-era video game."
181,raya_and_the_last_dragon,critics,fresh,p,"It matters that, in a region with so much diversity, the movie itself depicts this diversity in its landscapes, the people that live in them, and the subcultures they live with."
182,raya_and_the_last_dragon,critics,fresh,p,"Highly enjoyed its message of teamwork & the importance of forgiveness & trust. I had plenty of fun, particularly with its side characters."
183,raya_and_the_last_dragon,critics,fresh,p,It's so similar to pretty much everything Disney has put out in the last decade that it feels awfully repetitive.
184,raya_and_the_last_dragon,critics,rotten,n,The motivations and agendas of the warring characters were nicely complex which is rare for an animated feature. Awkwafina does quite funny if anachronistically contemporary voice work as the dragon. Yet something about it felt soulless.
185,raya_and_the_last_dragon,critics,fresh,p,"Raya finds inspiration in all the right places, and imbues it with the emotional weight and bright, fantastic aesthetic we've come to expect with Disney's big-screen adventures."

187,raya_and_the_last_dragon,critics,fresh,p,The story feels like more of a means to an end to show off some flashy animation rather than giving us anything to really care about.
188,raya_and_the_last_dragon,critics,fresh,p,"...top drawer Disney, it's a thoughtful, nimble riposte to the brainless slug-fests that most family films descend into, and it's a self-aware, open-minded slice of world-building that should open the doors for a new franchise..."
189,raya_and_the_last_dragon,critics,fresh,p,"You won't be able to take your eyes off of ""Raya and the Last Dragon' with the beautiful palette of colors that make this Disney film pop off screen.

190,raya_and_the_last_dragon,critics,fresh,p,The great thing about this film is that Raya isn't your conventional Disney Princess.
191,raya_and_the_last_dragon,critics,fresh,p,"The story, the dialogue, the voicework and animation are all of the highest caliber. Not only are the visuals imaginative and gorgeous but there are life lessons to be learned about trust and selflessness and taking chances."
192,raya_and_the_last_dragon,critics,fresh,p,"Something amazing was created in spite of everything working against it, both mirroring and informing Raya's story, a plea for trust and an inclusive celebration of differences... emotional, entertaining, and powerful."

199,raya_and_the_last_dragon,audience,5.0,p,Great movie with beautiful imageries and a powerful and touching message!
200,raya_and_the_last_dragon,audience,1.0,n,"Esta ''pelicula'' si es como deberiamos llamarla, es muy mala, para empezar el inicio es como Avatar:La leyenda de Aang luego tiene elclasico villano que parecia que era bueno pero al final era malo, luego por conveniencias del guión todo lo que parece imposible se hace posible y por ultimo da un mesaje mediocre sobre  que cualquiera puede cambiar, la importancia sobre la amistad y el trabajo en equipo, Y si repasamos todo esto nos damos cuenta que es lo basico de cada pelicula lo quue se uso en miles de peliculasanimadas, los niños merecen una mejor calidad no solo por ser niños vas a volver a lo basico, por ejemplo hay buenas peliculas animadas como Shrek, El rey león, Toy Story, etc. Y estas peliculas innovaron ya que tienen mensajes más ocultos que llegan a reflexionar a grandes y a chicos. Conclusión Raya y el ultimo dragon es mas un reciclaje que una pelicula."
201,raya_and_the_last_dragon,audience,5.0,p,94%. Top tier animated movie. Great story from start to finish. The animation is incredible. The visuals of of the five different cities with the different ecosystem are jaw dropping. Must rewatch
202,raya_and_the_last_dragon,audience,5.0,p,"must watch, needs a TV series sequel."
203,raya_and_the_last_dragon,audience,2.0,n,"confusing message and bad story. It was way too fast for the story it wants to tell, the joke are not that and the main character is inconsistent. I wouldn't even recommend it to a kid because of the moral. Two stars for the world building because it had potential."
204,raya_and_the_last_dragon,audience,5.0,p,Another amazing Disney movie. Too bad it had Aquafina
205,raya_and_the_last_dragon,audience,1.5,n,"They play very strong themes, inappropriate for children."
206,raya_and_the_last_dragon,audience,4.0,p,"Raya and the Last Dragon is such an extraordinary film that is jam-packed with action and adventure. It is new territory for Disney as the studio has hardly delved into the world of full-blown action and hand-to-hand combat. They should continue to traverse the world of punches and kicks because it operates very favorably here. The action sequences are spot-on and have some stalwart choreography. Plus, the production design and art direction are breathtaking. Many of the locations in the film get saturated with wonder and life. Each of the five lands was fascinating to view and had a lot of fascinating details. Topping it off is the animation, as it is some of the best visuals Disney has put out. Everything looked so real, and the textures were captivating. While Raya and the Last Dragon may look flawless, there were a few predicaments with the script. The screenplay was yearning for a layer of explanation that would make the film feel complete. What is there is imaginative, and there is a strong base for a compelling narrative. However, the dragon lore and the gem magic felt like characters were mentioning it without having rules to elements. Yes, the gem needed to have all the pieces to work, but that was after it broke. Plus, why was Sisu dormant for all these years? There were still questions by the end of the movie that needed answers. The script problems faded into the background sometimes when Raya and the Last Dragon had a sensational cast to help create the magic of the film. Kelly Marie Tran is stellar in the titular role. Tran truly embodies Raya and puts her all into formulating such a compelling character. Supporting Tran is Awkwafina, who knows how to keep the energy growing. Awkwafina works with Tran quite strongly, and she can shift between the content and challenging components rather nicely. Gemma Chan is unrecognizable in the role of Namaari. Chan puts a lot of power into her performance and helps boost the themes of the film. Chan is a tremendous voice actress, and I would love to see her in more voice roles in the future. The supporting cast that includes Daniel Dae Kim, Benedict Wong, Izaac Wang, and Sandra Oh provide wondrous voice work that elevates this film to a higher level. Behind these vocals is a mighty score from James Newton Howard. Howard does not disappoint when it comes to composing a score that fits the vibe of the film. Although, using more Southeast Asian influences would have made the score even better. The cinematography is also remarkable. Many of the scenes in Raya and the Last Dragon look breathtaking. Each shot looks like a painting and beautifully captures the essence the film is trying to exhibit. Raya and the Last Dragon is a phenomenal film that can create and tell lore with astounding characters. However, with a weak script that leaves unanswered questions, the world of Kumandra feels a bit hollow. Yet, the awe-inspiring visual designs and a lively cast make Raya and the Last Dragon stand out in the Disney Animation catalog. Read more reviews like this at postcreditreviews.com"
207,raya_and_the_last_dragon,audience,4.0,p,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS Not bad, it has numerous similarities to Avatar: The Last Airbender, as well. > Freeing the last of a kind after over a century > A big rideable, friendly animal to travel > A group of allies formed of people from every nation > Learning a new power after visiting each nation > The heir to the throne of the nation that is the biggest threat is hunting them down, and then joins them eventually > Additionally, Raya looks exactly like Korra in the first 5 minutes of the film"
208,raya_and_the_last_dragon,audience,4.5,p,"Delightful film! As an adult I have to admit that the premise of the story, that trust in other is paramount to coexistence, was striking in that it felt particularly relevant to our current politics in a way that is usually avoided in favor of more universal tropes. I felt Raya's mistrust, I was angered by the actions of others, I was excited to see selfish retribution at the expense of the obvious and urgent need for unity. I think for me that is what sets this film apart, maybe for others that message won't resonate as strongly. Regardless, there is a lot more to enjoy in this one than just the messaging including Cat Puns, Awkwafina, Baby Ninja and Entourage, Sensitive Prose Guised in Over Compensating Masculinity, and a Roly Poly Whatchamacallit that is basically a whole new level of adorable."
0,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,Takes courage to make your first film. But to make it around the conversation of four giants and pulling it off is on another level of guts. Regina King's directorial debut causes intrigue into knowing more about these men. [Full review in Spanish]
1,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,A good hang-out movie that invokes the stage more than the cinema.
2,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"With these guys out in front and King behind the camera, Miami is quite the appealing actors' show. King and her performers capture a fascinating moment in African-American history."
3,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"With fine acting, clear direction and perceptive relevance, One Night in Miami transforms from a strong play into powerful cinema."
4,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"There is so much beauty seeing our people depicted onscreen without the focus being on trauma, but a way through."
5,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"In such politically troubled times, where it seems that any political disagreement creates an unbreachable interpersonal rift, One Night in Miami shows the beauty of productive disagreement and dissent."
6,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"In the end, there's an underlying reason why there has been nothing but praise for Regina King and One Night in Miami."
7,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"As Cooke, Ali, and Brown, Leslie Odom Jr., Eli Goree, and Aldis Hodge are all in the pocket. It's Hodge, though, who brings the most to his character while still recognizably playing Jim Brown."
8,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,Brotherhood and Race Drive the Beautifully Executed 'One Night in Miami'
9,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"An electrifying philosophical fantasia that imagines four towering figures of 1960s America arguing over how to navigate racism as Black men. Enraging, but also thrilling, bursting with cinematic joy."
10,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"What a sure hand Regina King showed in her directorial debut! It's a solid and proven screenplay, yes, but to block and shoot a chamber piece like this requires a lot else."
11,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,Delivers a timely message on the interplay between celebrity and advocacy during turbulent times.
12,one_night_in_miami,critics,rotten,n,"There's no sense of the spiritual and theological foundations of black American survival. Instead, One Night in Miami establishes a cult of celebrity activism, with Malcolm as its deity."
13,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,What if...?
14,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,This is a must-watch film for anyone who needs to learn why Black Lives Matter.
15,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"A whip-smart, well-appointed period drama built around a terrific cast, crackling dialogue and an undeniably inspired premise."
16,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"Reminiscent of Nicolas Roeg's 1985 film Insignificance, which imagined a fictional hotel room meeting between Marilyn Monroe, Albert Einstein, Joe DiMaggio, and Joseph McCarthy."
17,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,A fictional recreation of a gathering of four Black leaders and their sometimes heated conversation about their goals and aspirations.
18,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"Usually, with these kind of films, people get caught up in the historical accuracy...here, they move and shift events around, but really, it embraces the spirit of the time and the characters. Can't speak highly enough for it."
19,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"A film not only of exceptional power and feeling, but of abundant texture and detail as well."
20,one_night_in_miami,audience,4.0,p,A great story of the struggle to be a public figure. But at times it felt like the movie was dragging on.
21,one_night_in_miami,audience,4.0,p,"Wondered what all the awards were about and now I see.  Great people making a difference in racial equality in their own unique way.  Singing was great, too!"
22,one_night_in_miami,audience,5.0,p,"Electrifying performances from the four leads make this stage adapted, the directorial debut from Regina King never let up. It maintains just enough stage feel to remind the audience where it came from without being too distracting. Its message and dialogue, unfortunately, ring true even today. Ms. King knows her way around behind the camera and I look forward to her next endeavor."
23,one_night_in_miami,audience,1.5,n,This is long and boring.  I learned some things.  But essentially this is a two hour discussion of racism.  It lacked a lot in terms of entertainment.
24,one_night_in_miami,audience,3.5,p,So good. The actors are all incredible and play off each other well.
25,one_night_in_miami,audience,3.0,p,"I had a lot of trouble getting past the part where all of the guys are in the hotel room because Malcolm invited them there under super-false pretenses so that he could railroad them into a sales pitch for his religion. All of the actors did an excellent job with their roles and Odom's singing parts were the highlight of the movie for me, but about 60% of the way through I realized they had wanted me to forgive or forget that Malcolm had not only basically lied to get them all there but then forced them to stay in the room while he took a leisurely stroll to the payphone to have a lengthy conversation with his daughter & to bring a camera back to show them that nobody had any interest in. I think I could've moved on had this been a true story, but since it wasn't it means that someone wrote as a character trait for Malcolm that he was incredibly casual with other people's time, a trait that I doubt he really had. The posturing from the bodyguards wasn't interesting either, but at the end of the day 90% of the movie was watching historical figures interact with each other, and it would've taken more problems than this to have made that an unenjoyable viewing experience."
26,one_night_in_miami,audience,5.0,p,One of the best movies I've ever seen.
27,one_night_in_miami,audience,4.5,p,"Mostly conversation, but great dialogue from interesting characters."
28,one_night_in_miami,audience,1.5,n,"Two words: nothing happens. The plot was nearly as simple as it gets, with most of the film taking place in one hotel room. There were about eight different sets in the entire film - the house at the beginning, the boxing ring, the swimming pool, the hotel room, Malcolm X's house, the hotel roof, the diner, and the TV show at the end. Then the real ending was just some white text on a black background, which felt like a complete cop-out. There was a little bit of suspense when Malcolm X was being followed, but then they didn't do anything, which demonstrated that nothing exciting was going to happen for the rest of the film either. Malcom X's house was on fire for a really short scene, but Malcolm X didn't know how to handle a gun and only his family was shown on screen, again meaning no actual action. As for the dialogue, there was too much of it, and all of it was fictional. The film was just a rambling discussion about being black vs being white, which meant poor pacing. The message has been discussed many times before and felt timed with the current political climate more than anything. The acting was well done but fake at the same time. The characters somewhat lacked depth and came across as rather one dimensional because the dialogue was repetitive. For instance, Muhammad Ali spent the entire film repeating derivatives of 'I am the greatest'. They also weren't given proper introductions, so if you've never heard of them before, you'll be completely lost. However, the cinematography was decent, the visual effects were fine, the sets/props/costumes looked the part, and the soundtrack was all right, although the singing seemed rather edited. Overall, the film could have been so much more than four actors walking around a room arguing about races and discrimination."
29,one_night_in_miami,audience,3.5,p,"Although obviously based on a one-room stage play, the director skillfully stages this adaptation with imaginative camerawork and several flashback scenes; moreover, the four main actors manage to present their interactions with drama, suspense and humor."
30,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Though we'd love to see a Deaf story that doesn't need to use a Hearing protagonist as an ""entry point,"" the unique and under-seen family dynamic portrayed on screen still feels fresh."

35,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"What really works about this film are the rougher edges, the moments of ambivalence on the margins (and even at the centre) and its firm awareness of uncertainty."
36,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,A love letter to family
37,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"With warmth, humor and a strong cast, CODA has turned a conventional family dynamic and an oft-told tale of a teenager pursuing her dream into something special."

39,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"CODA's story is quite powerful... The rest of the plot about self-improvement and fighting for the right thing can be trite, but it works, and it works very well. [Full review in Spanish]"
40,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Whether a remake had been absolutely necessary for this is a matter of opinion. But on its own, CODA is a nice crowd-pleaser. [Full review in Spanish]"
41,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Not bad, the actors are very convincing but, I insist, is there no way for the gringos to read subtitles and watch the original films? In this case, La famille Bélier, was a much better movie."
42,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Heder takes the movie in various directions with its mix of coming-of-age drama, high school angst, broad comedy, and working-class themes, but it all works, coming together as a memorable family movie night pick for parents with teens."
43,coda_2021,critics,rotten,n,"Lamentably, only the humorous moments prevail."
44,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"What I loved about Sian Heder's film, the title of which stands for Child of Deaf Adults, is that it created magic without much effort or showing off."
45,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Predictable, yes, but no reasonable person wants failure for this genuinely warm and loving family."
46,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Heder cuts to silence during Ruby's solo at the school choir concert in order to give us the family's perspective, and the effect is as profound as it is heartbreaking."
47,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Films like CODA represent a changing of the Hollywood guard - more folks at the table, putting people in the jobs they should've had all along."
48,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Try not to be moved by this loving, needy, overwhelmed and surprisingly horny family confronting change."
49,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,Bravo to co-writer and sole director Sian Heder for breathing fresh life into an old but reliable storyline.
50,coda_2021,audience,4.5,p,"Well-paced, compelling, great cast and songs. One of the best films of the year."
51,coda_2021,audience,5.0,p,"This movie does everything a coming-of-age film should do, but goes one step further. It shines a light on topics rarely seen in films. A truly heartwarming movie. Possibly my favourite film of the year."
52,coda_2021,audience,4.5,p,"CODA (A) 
A brilliant piece of art that will have you all wrapped up in the story. It is very heartfelt and even though everyone may not be able to relate to having close people in their lives that are deaf they will be easily able to relate to the themes this story effortlessly presents. You can tell a lot of care went into making this film and it really comes off as feeling super authentic. I realized as I was watching it how much I began to care about the characters and I was really hoping everything would go well for them all. I felt that I had been apart of the story with how relatable it is and how well it is acted out and directed. I did feel that the middle section lost a little bit of traction with the story maybe staying a little to long in some scenes. The last section of this film however is very powerful and moving. You see this family grow through trials and the final payoff of the film really rewards viewers for becoming engaged in  the film. The film left me feeling joyful and excited to take on my own personal  next steps in this crazy thing we call life. In my opinion this is a must watch and a film that should not be overlooked."
53,coda_2021,audience,5.0,p,Movie Perfection. Guaranteed to make you cry.
54,coda_2021,audience,5.0,p,"An absolute masterpiece, combining humor and sentimentality. I'm getting a lot of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" vibes, with the quirky characters coming together. Eugenio Derbez Steals the show as the music teacher and Troy Kotsur is fantastic!  Emilia Jones is a talent that will only grow, and Sian Heder‘a steady and confident direction and script is a Masterclass in narrative storytelling. Even though the film takes place in a small New England town, the scope is still there with lush clouds and a shiny sun on the sea. I cried three times in the third act. Truly a work of art."
55,coda_2021,audience,5.0,p,"Coming from almost the same exact situation, this movie brought out the belly laughs and the tears of joy all in one. Growing up with deaf parents (but with 2 hearing older sisters), there isn't enough praise that I could give this movie. It was just like reliving my child hood. With the weed smoking, hearing the bed squeeking, to being the interpreter for all diffrent types of situations 😊 haha. Thank you for giving some insight into how hard it could be with not only the kids that could hear but the parents as well. This movie to me is just as much as a tribute to the lead character who could hear as well as the two deaf parents who over came their diversity to their surroundings and actually stood out and above alot of the other people in their community. It's a triple A movie ""Amazing, Amazing,  Amazing""!!"
56,coda_2021,audience,3.0,p,"It's full of clichés and it's very predictable and there are many films out there with similar stories. But, at the same time i feel like it is very well made with great acting and to my surprise an interesting cinematography.
Didn't love it but it is enjoyable."
57,coda_2021,audience,3.5,p,"In CODA, the beautiful and the cliche walk alongside, producing a feel-good family-friendly film that, although not particularly innovative, lets us take a glance at the lives of a culturally deaf family in a mature approach."
58,coda_2021,audience,4.0,p,"Troy Kotsur is marvelous in this movie. I loved it, even though some scenes were a bit too on the nose. Nice family movie."
59,coda_2021,audience,5.0,p,"Coda is this years absolute crowdpleaser, offering a masterfully enjoyable coming-of-age story in which not only the younger characters get it to their fullest potential, but the elders elevate their material to equal heights. Its impressive cast deserves all the awards and praise for this."
60,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"The Power of the Dog is essential viewing for cinema fans, a brilliant example of a non-Western Western and another stellar entry in award-winning Campion's canon."

64,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"[A] brilliant and haunting piece of filmmaking...[a] tale of how we too often tear others down because we can't stop tearing ourselves apart...harsh but beautiful, unforgettable but unforgiving ... exquisitely isolating."
65,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"The Power of the Dog features some of the best performances you'll see all year with gorgeous cinematography, a fantastic ending, and an almost horror movie-like atmosphere proceeding over the entire enterprise."
66,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"While the movie offers little in the way of catharsis, it's an undeniably powerful experience, as stark as those hills from the first shot."
67,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"Campion handles such psychological denseness with virtuoso control, often whittling scenes to snippets of emotion and innuendo."
68,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,Jane Campion's film quietly sneaks up on you if you're willing to settle in with it. She's the kind of director who wants the audience to do part of the work without forcing every emotion and action on to us.
69,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"The Power of the Dog gives an unflinching and riveting portrait of toxic masculinity, homophobia, and family tensions. Even though the movie is set in 1925 Montana, the themes are universal and timeless ... It's intriguing cinematic art."
70,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"It's not your typical shoot-em up Western, by any means. It's a sophisticated arthouse piece that requires avid thought and attention."
71,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"The film opens with an air of ""There Will Be Blood"" before morphing into full-blown ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" then flirts with ""Call Me By Your Name"" before landing somewhere between ""The Beguiled"" and ""Basic Instinct."""
72,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"It's not subtle, with certain objects taking on blunt, heavy symbolic weight - paper flowers, cigarettes, a saddle, a rawhide lariat, shadows on hillsides. But it has a tense, unsettling power as it moves towards an unexpected ending."
73,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"Campion has lost none of her potency, using the landscape, and even the earth itself, to tell this primal, feral story."
74,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,rotten,n,"Campion is a master director, more about poetry than cinematic energy. An uneasy watch but a destructive investigation on feminism and family...but ultimately all a chore to watch."
75,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"Without the complex layers to Phil's character and motivations, it might have been just an exercise in endurance, but it was a breathtaking and suspenseful human mystery instead."
76,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,We're talking about this when it comes to awards season.

82,the_power_of_the_dog,audience,4.0,p,"On first sight a very slow paced movie where not a lot happens, but after looking up the meaning of the story afterwards, everything fell into place and I immediately wanted to watch it again with a new perspective. Sublime filmmaking."
83,the_power_of_the_dog,audience,0.5,n,Slow and uninteresting.
84,the_power_of_the_dog,audience,5.0,p,"Breathtaking. From the first to last the scene. And it the end it will crack your heart. 

Outstanding performances of Benedict Cumberbatch, Kodi Smit-McPhee and Kirsten Dunst. Amazing work by director Jane Campion.  

Must watch!"
85,the_power_of_the_dog,audience,0.5,n,"Great acting? Sure. Everything else? Awful. Slow, boring, story was painfully bad. And thanks again Hollywood for trying to normalize an older man taking advantage of a young man/boy. But hey it was cold out, right? Ugh. Surely this will win picture of the year…"
86,the_power_of_the_dog,audience,3.5,p,"This is the absolute example of why movies need to be seen in a movie theatre and not at home on the couch.  With the slow and plodding pace, I must have stopped 10 times to do something else.  Perhaps in a movie theatre where I am enveloped by the spectacular cinematography and haunting score I would have been more vested in the film.  However, as it is, this is the quintessential ""critics"" movie."

89,the_power_of_the_dog,audience,0.5,n,"Ok The Power of dog was not only strangely pretentious art  but excruciatingly slow. Painful characters. A most agonizing unrewarding ending. I can't even describe further. I can only say i  survived the film. Barely. 
In addition,  I may never be able to look at Benedict Cumberbatch act again, Dr Strange notwithstanding.
Jane Campion hates people, pianos and men in particular. I wish my brain could throw up"

92,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,"Casablanca walks a thin line between classic romance and cheesy, but it stays true to its course. It could have very easily steered right into cheesy and stayed there, but because Curtiz had a vision it doesn't go there."
93,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,"This is an occasion where the final whole seriously and decisively outweighs the sum of its flawed, imperfect parts. Screenwriter Koch lived up to his pledge to ""develop a serious melodrama of present-day significance."""

96,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,"Warners have been generous in fitting fine players to roles that become gems, each in its own way, through 1 the incisive handling of Claude Rains, Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Dooley Wilson, S. Z. Sakall and Joy Page."

103,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,"Director Michael Curtiz, whose sureness and skill ere rarely to be questioned in any picture he handles, have given Casablanca an exotic atmosphere, a flow of action, surprises and punch to make it constantly interesting."
104,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,Casablanca is brisk well made for those who like romance and adventure handled by a good actor like Mr Bogart.
105,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,"Apparently Casablanca, which I must say I liked, is working up a rather serious reputation as a fine melodrama. Why? It is obviously an improvement on one of the world's worst plays; but it is not such an improvement that that is not obvious."

111,1003707-casablanca,audience,5.0,p,"This is likely the most famous movie of all time and for good reason.  Certainly the most quoted, and frequently cited as an all time favorite, Casablanca won Best Picture, Director, and Writer awards at the Oscars.  the definitive rebuttal to notions of the author in film, the romantic drama put together in pieces by many different sources, with script pages completed just moments before the cameras rolled.  The performances by Bogart and Bergman are so subtle and complex because the actors themselves had no idea how it was going to end.  

Almost every frame of the movie is an icon, and it has been endlessly copied and parodied."
112,1003707-casablanca,audience,5.0,p,"Absolutely the best screenplay ever written. So many snappy, quotable lines, by performers at the top of their game. This includes Conrad Veidt, the great German silent film actor, the leering Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Calude Rains, Dooley Wilson, Paul Henreid, and the incomparable Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart. The one movie I watch every time it is on, and still pick up on subtleties."
113,1003707-casablanca,audience,5.0,p,I love old Movies and at the height of the war this one shows what people were desperate to do to escape. The love and compassion was amazing in this Movie. Humphrey Bogart is at his best in this film.

142,judas_and_the_black_messiah,audience,3.0,p,A little boring and unfulfilled potential for me.
143,judas_and_the_black_messiah,audience,4.0,p,"What would young people do today if faced with the same situation, as Mr. Hampton and his officials did? That's the context you should watch this movie, and then read the history of the story, and you'll understand the genius of this man. Black or not, this is a film about using the power of your youth to drive a world you want to see, knowing you won't get there to see it. Take that social media justice warriors!"
144,judas_and_the_black_messiah,audience,2.5,n,"Before I get into this review, I have to say the soundtrack(or at least this one tune that's part of the soundtrack) really annoyed me. It plays in the beginning before Bill goes into the bar and once again near the end when he's getting the drugs to off Fred. To me it sounded like a very loud and weirdly annoying train and each time I just had to hit the mute button. Anyways, for the movie itself.. it was alright, but a bit too long for my taste. Depressing a bit, cops killing blacks in the late 60's in Chicago and one of the guys in the Black Panther party is an undercover guy working for the FBI because of a stolen car. Sucks that this is the way of the totally not racist America(:sarcasm alert:) but that's the reality we live in, even today."

146,judas_and_the_black_messiah,audience,4.5,p,"As someone not educated in this area of history, I was absolutely blown away by this film and enjoyed learning the harrowing tale told through the well written and paced narrative, that is as intense as it is heart wrenching. The film is a technical marvel, with immaculate, time period accurate production design and visuals, supported by an immersive soundtrack. It is also superbly acted and very well shot.
8.83/10"
147,judas_and_the_black_messiah,audience,4.0,p,"Film importante, che ha l'immenso pregio di non porre in secondo piano la qualità rispetto alla ricerca del compiacimento del pubblico.
Non ci sono facili colpi di scena, ne personaggi ""manichino"" volti ad abbellire il cast.
Si punta tutto sulla grandissima qualità della sceneggiatura e sull'ottima credibilità del cast; in special modo su uno degli astri nascenti del cinema quale Daniel Kaluuya, in grado di rappresentare con grandissima intensità un personaggio che per tutto il film non usa mai il suo corpo o le sue espressioni in maniera esagerata; ma che colpisce solamente con lo sguardo e con le parole.
Il finale è scioccante tanto da lasciare interdetti nella maniera più assoluta; le didascalie finali offrono il giusto resoconto per permettere di essere a conoscenza anche dei fatti tralasciati per ragioni cinematografiche."

152,flee,critics,fresh,p,"Flee is not the most technically dazzling animated movie you'll ever see. However, Flee will be one of the best animated films you'll ever see, because the true story behind it so powerfully moving, it will have an impact on you that you'll never forget."
153,flee,critics,fresh,p,"This movie very effectively uses animation, voice-overs and historical film footage to reveal the horrors of refugee life."
154,flee,critics,fresh,p,"It's hugely involving on a range of levels, both in the bigger themes and the darker emotions."
155,flee,critics,fresh,p,That [Amin's] willing... to finally release his secrets to an old friend is a gift we're lucky to share in.
156,flee,critics,fresh,p,"While previously we've had a number of refugee stories -- particularly refugees from Afghanistan -- in animation, this is the first one where using it really makes sense."
157,flee,critics,fresh,p,The animation here is used for such expressionistic beauty.
158,flee,critics,fresh,p,An extraordinary achievement... An absolutely brilliant use of animation.
159,flee,critics,fresh,p,"As an animated documentary is quite engrossing and sometimes even moving. But as biography, it's barely sketched in."
160,flee,critics,fresh,p,A fantastic example of what can be done in the documentary space... also just a lovely story that shows what can be done with animation.
161,flee,critics,fresh,p,Flee is a beautifully rendered story of a refugee's life and how his turbulent childhood and adolescence continue to impact him as an adult.
162,flee,critics,fresh,p,A bold animated film about a refugee and the search for home.
163,flee,critics,fresh,p,"The end of the story might have been more developed but, at heart, Flee brings us close to the young Amin, his family and the nearly impossible choices they faced."
164,flee,critics,fresh,p,An intimate portrait of the lasting traumas of displacement and one of the most humane films of the year.
165,flee,critics,fresh,p,"Evocatively animated in a style that is visually sparse but emotionally vibrant, with a strong sense of motion and interiority."
166,flee,critics,fresh,p,Rarely has animation been used as imaginatively and intuitively as in this harrowing documentary that uses one man's refugee story to bring intimate context to a worldwide crisis.
167,flee,critics,fresh,p,"Flee is a testament to the broken social systems that allow refugee families to fall through the cracks, leaving children desperate and vulnerable."
168,flee,critics,fresh,p,The year's most inventive animated adventure mixes graphic design with documentary realism and puts hallucinatory brilliance at the service of understanding the continuing psychic damage of war. You'll never forget it.
169,flee,critics,fresh,p,This isn't really a movie about being a refugee or being a gay man. It's a movie about the damage that keeping secrets does to the mind and soul.
170,flee,audience,5.0,p,"Gorgeously animated, and reverently told, FLEE is a true story of the human will to survive, the gay male journey to find long-term romantic love in the wake of trauma, and most earnestly, the too often unforeseen toll that the high price of freedom can take on refugees courageous enough to pursue it. I hope this film provides healing to its subject and his family. And I hope it wins best animated feature film at the Golden Globes and the Oscars. NYers: it is currently playing at AMC Lincoln Square and Angelika Film Center."
171,flee,audience,5.0,p,"A breathtaking masterpiece. This is the purpose of cinema. To understand others, to here stories we couldn't even imagine. I would give Flee the Oscar for Best Documentary, Best Animated Feature, Best International Picture and Best Picture."
172,flee,audience,4.5,p,Unique and impacting story followed by a great animation and a good progress the way a documentary should have. I hope this movie makes history at the awards.
173,flee,audience,5.0,p,"Flee is the rare documentary animated movie you can find and also the rare perfect animated movie of the year. Heart wrenching but also hopeful, Flee is a very humanistic movie that deals with the trauma of being a refugee and it's one of the best movies of the year without a doubt and i hope more people get to see it soon and hear Amin's story."
174,flee,audience,5.0,p,"I was instantly captivated. I couldn’t get enough of the different ways the story was told via the different animation styles and score. What a beautiful story I wish the whole world would see to create some empathy for our mankind in need. Bravo! What a brave story to tell and portray, really hope the main character is doing very well!!"
175,flee,audience,5.0,p,This film is so engaging and uplifting!  The story of escape and self discovery told through animation...I can't stop thinking about it.  A must see!
176,flee,audience,5.0,p,"It is brilliant, sad, heroic and unimaginable that a child, that children have to go through this.

177,pig_2021,critics,fresh,p,"A study of grief and regret, with a Nic Cage who has remembered how to convey these emotions through subtle facial gestures and specific actions. [Full review in Spanish]"
178,pig_2021,critics,fresh,p,A touching meditation on grief and a critique of the high-end restaurant scene.
179,pig_2021,critics,fresh,p,A terrifically serious movie.
180,pig_2021,critics,fresh,p,I will probably select Nicolas Cage for my actor nominations I am voting for. He's great and the movie is a winner.
181,pig_2021,critics,fresh,p,The film is no Truffle Hunters. But Cage keeps it watchable.
182,pig_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Rob (Cage) is a fascinating character. A man of quiet courage and dignity, he imparts a kind of wisdom to others that is universal. That is because he, unlike most people, has come to terms with the utter finality of death."
183,pig_2021,critics,fresh,p,The pig really is beautiful; a purebred Kunekune with auburn hair and expressive eyes.
184,pig_2021,critics,fresh,p,"This movie has plenty to say about fraught family relationships and the transformative power of a good meal, but Rob's takedown of fine dining makes this story of a man looking for his pig stand out from the pack."
185,pig_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Pig is about acknowledging the irreversible nature of grief and accepting the bleakest memories of our lives. It is a beautifully acted, complex film deserving of repeat viewings."
186,pig_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Pig is a melancholic, thoughtful debut from writer-director Michael Sarnoski, and Cage's raw performance will make your heart ache and remind you how superb he can be with the right material."
187,pig_2021,critics,fresh,p,"If you have an open mind, you will be rewarded with a melancholic and poignant story, and a superb, triumphant performance from Cage who has no trouble reminding audiences that he is an Oscar winner capable of incredible range and depth."
188,pig_2021,critics,fresh,p,"There are few actors who could pull off this tonal balancing act as successfully as Cage... Over the years, some have questioned how far he's in on his own joke -- but at this point, there's no doubting his finely tuned sense of the ridiculous."
189,pig_2021,critics,fresh,p,"A quietly poignant and strangely beautiful little gem that touched my heart like few other films this year, Pig is a deeply special wonder."
190,pig_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Nicolas Cage is mesmerizing in this contemplative and existential story of grief, acceptance and true happiness. [Full Review in Spanish]"
191,pig_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Subtle enough in its intentions, but clear in its execution, Pig utilises Nicolas Cage's superb performance to produce a rare showcase of anti-violence, identity, grief, and hope."
192,pig_2021,critics,fresh,p,"With brilliant performances, assured direction and an engrossing emotional core within its story, Pig rewards the patient with gripping honesty and fantastic filmmaking. Nicolas Cage delivers a nuanced yet emotionally thrilling performance."
193,pig_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Cage is magnificent with young Alex Wolff 100 percent holding his own opposite him, and the writing, the pace, it's a cinematic feast."
194,pig_2021,critics,fresh,p,There's a fair bit to unpick here and Pig provides a nice balance of intrigue and dramatic action.
195,pig_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Most of this wouldn't simmer the way that it does without Cage, who delivers one of his finest performances in recent memory, and it's a pleasure to see a filmmaker willing to resist the easy path and trust in his actor's ability to underplay."
196,pig_2021,critics,fresh,p,"A deeply moving film with twists and turns that few could see coming, Pig is - amongst other things - a timely reminder of just how good Nicolas Cage is at his job."
197,pig_2021,audience,3.0,p,Cage was really good and I do appreciate the 90 minute movie in a world where it seems every movie is 2 and half + hours. Didn’t feel a connection to the characters and found it to be sad and boring at times. Still worth a watch though for Cage
198,pig_2021,audience,2.5,n,It's a movie that is slow and bleak throughout. Nicholas Cage is great but it's just not my cup of tea.
199,pig_2021,audience,3.5,p,"Even though Pig contains an engaging story and some interesting characters, the film lacks a sense of thrill. The script for Pig is in a complicated situation as the basic plotline sounds like an enjoyable time. However, the execution is uneven and does have that sense of energy. The film starts quite strong, with striking visuals and some compelling moments. However, once the abduction occurs, the film becomes cliché and slightly predictable. Many components of the film are easy to see coming, and the dynamic between Amir and Robin has been in other films. Watching Pig is like riding a rollercoaster of emotions. There would be a thrilling scene with a package of emotions attached to it. Then a long, dull sequence would follow. There is absolutely nothing wrong with having a moment that gives sentiment and exposition. However, it is hard to warrant those sequences when the tone set for the story is not consistent. The cast of Pig is what keeps the film in place for most of its duration. Nicolas Cage is a magnificent lead. He packs plenty of passion into his role even when he is monotone for almost the whole film. Cage is not trying too hard but is not doing too little. It is a superb performance that made the film stand out from other actors this year. Alex Wolff contradicts the energy Cage puts out seamlessly. Amir is a very formulaic character, but Wolff adds his touch. Wolff and Cage work amazingly together, and they bounce their lines off of each other naturally. For his directorial debut, Michael Sarnoski does a decent job with Pig. While the tone is inconsistent, the film has many intriguing scenes with great direction. The cinematography is on-point, with plenty of striking shots occupying the duration. The creative choices made in the cinematography highlight how Pig is all about the character Robin. The sound design is immaculate. There are a lot of moments in Pig where the score is absent. This vacancy allows the outstanding sound design to kick in. Each incorporation of each sound into the film was flawless. While Pig has its flaws of inconsistency and some slight clichés, it is an intriguing film with fantastic technical elements. Plus, Nicolas Cage and Alex Wolff do not disappoint in the lead roles. With just some more tweaking to the script, Pig could have been one of the best films of the year.

200,pig_2021,audience,2.5,n,"Pig is the most serious dramatic movie ever made about the seedy underworld of restaurant supply. I didn't know what to expect, but this Nicholas Cage movie about a truffle hunter looking for his stolen pig want wasn't it. Entirely too serious, far too much intrigue, over-the-top drama for a story about the cutthroat world of the foodies who supply gastropubs in Portland with fresh local sourced organic ingredients. Hilarious long dramatic pauses punctuate inane conversations. And then there's the underground restaurant fight club. Seriously. That's a thing in this movie.

Worth watching just to enjoy the uber seriousness."
201,pig_2021,audience,5.0,p,Excellent movie. The understated performance of Nicolas Cage was perfect. The story was intriguing and it is a gem.
202,pig_2021,audience,4.0,p,"Nicolas Cage gives an emotionally gripping performance in PIG, a film about loss, love, grief & confronting the past. From first time director Michael Sarnoski, Cage plays Rob, a truffle hunter living alone with his pig in the isolated woods outside Portland, Oregon. His valued pig is kidnapped, forcing Rob to travel back to Portland after 15 years of isolation in attempts to find her. What transpires is a film that goes beyond the search, with Cage's Rob confronting people and places left behind and facing a myriad of emotions. Features a strong cameo from actor Adam Arkin (TV's ""Sons of Anarchy,"" ""Chicago Hope"")."
203,pig_2021,audience,5.0,p,"A complete surprise, this is now my top movie for 2021. It's built up like a thousand other movies, the most recent template being John Wick, but... it is different. Saying more would spoil it, but suffice it to say that I was enraptured throughout."
204,pig_2021,audience,3.5,p,"Plutôt inattendu et pour le coup rafraîchissant.
Nicolas Cage dans ce qu'il fait de meilleur.

Vraiment pas mal du tout."
205,pig_2021,audience,5.0,p,"Best picture nom? Maybe...I loved the movie, and it's refreshing to watch something that doesn't make me vomit...like most movies today. The story changes enough that keeps you surprised and wanting to watch more. Great acting and story"
206,pig_2021,audience,0.5,n,Booooo! Such an unsatisfying movie!!! A colossal waste of time I'll never get back. Silly me for thinking it would end well. It was a lot of lead up to a lot of nothing.
0,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,"The cinematic treatment leaves this diminutive urban story feeling grand, classical and majestic."
1,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,"A refreshing, bracing break from not just what Hollywood churns out, but also from the awards-driven independent films that dominate the end of the year."
2,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,"Black lives matter in the quiet, contemplative Moonlight, but let's not stop there."
3,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,A majestic film of gentle moments and pregnant silences.
4,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,What makes Moonlight so amazing is that it almost shouldn't work at all. It is a character study with no lead actor.
5,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,Moonlight displays the kind of empathy and humanity that we desperately need right now.
6,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,A movie that beats with a very human heart while subverting expectations with almost every scene.
7,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,"Moonlight is one of the best movies of the year from a new and exciting voice in cinema. With his second film, Berry Jenkins shows a maturity beyond his years..."
8,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,"A fascinating character study that is sometimes tender, sometimes ferocious, yet always profound."
9,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,[Delivers] as both a remarkable exercise in sensuousness and a wholly affecting look at suffocated identity.
10,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,"A deconstruction of traditional masculinity as a societal prison, [Moonlight] never asks for compassion -- it entrusts its viewers to contain it within themselves."
11,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,"Right from the beginning, Moonlight makes its impact known. You're watching a reaffirmation of black culture by telling it from a different perspective and understanding."
12,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,To not understand the life depicted here is to not have humanity.
13,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,"The dialogue is exquisite, but the most powerful moments come from silence... intimate moments to reflect and comprehend Chiron's reality. [Full review in Spanish]"
14,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,"Unique and universal, bleak and hopeful, compassionate and humane, Moonlight eschews ordinary answers, constructs, and definitions."
15,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,"Relying on intensely naturalistic performances and situations, it somehow manages to smuggle in moments of interior lyricism without breaking the flow of the film[.]"
16,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,It's the social commentary on an intimately sincere human reality. [Full review in Spanish]
17,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,It's very good.
18,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,"A less pretentious, more poignant and powerful Boyhood."
19,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,The fact that Moonlight as a film even exists is impressive; but that it's as near-perfect a film as you'll see all year is miraculous.
20,moonlight_2016,audience,5.0,p,"This movie is phenomenal, Mahershala Ali is too good in this role. A very important movie to watch."
21,moonlight_2016,audience,5.0,p,everything!!! it's beyond any other gay theme movie
22,moonlight_2016,audience,5.0,p,"An extravagantly moving masterpiece that will touch the majority of viewers. A heartbreaking look at identity, sexuality and masculinity, that feels immensely personal, but at the same time universal, with its tackling of global issues such as: prostitution, drug abuse, discrimination etc…"
23,moonlight_2016,audience,0.5,n,"Just terrible, slow and completely uninteresting."
24,moonlight_2016,audience,5.0,p,There's no words to describe how wonderful this film is. Gloriously brilliant!
25,moonlight_2016,audience,0.5,n,"This movie is horrible and overrated. I'm sorry, but it was just super boring and depressing. I will say that Mahershala Ali deserved his Oscar, but he was only in the movie for a little bit, but then once he was gone the movie just got really dull and depressing.

This definitely should not have won best picture.
I feel like it won at the Oscars because of ""diversity."" It's about a gay African American. I'm all for diversity, but merit should come first. La la land was clearly superior in every way."
26,moonlight_2016,audience,5.0,p,"Let me just start off by saying, I love everything about this movie! The way Berry Jenkins uses lighting, Camera angles, and camera focus to tell the story, is a true piece of art. There are so many amazing parts of this movie but, I wanna talk about one scene in particular, with Juan and Chiron sitting at the dining room table, at Juan's House. The way the camera focuses on young Chiron at the table makes the sadness in the air emplified, with his chapped lips and puppy dog eyes staring at the camera and tunnel vision goes into effect. You also feel the effects of Juan as well in this scene, all you can see is his blurred out face and elbows on the table, Juan is on the verge of tears, just like me when I saw this scene for the first time. With all of this Beautiful cinematic work in only the first part of three, The viewers already knew this was going to be a work of art. In part two of the film there were many depressing moments during his teenage years, his mom verbally abuses him numerous times throughout this part of the movie, Whenever these incidents occur, the camera goes into the point of view of Chiron and everything zones out, with his mom distortedly tantruming and screaming in front of him. The way the camera follows Chiron's point of view, let's you get a feel for what he goes through and really shows you how it feels to be in his shoes. In the third, and final part, Chiron is a grown man and his mother is in a rehabilitation center. She is off the drugs but Chiron doesn't normally visit her because she always asks for ""favors"" from him. When he goes to visit, the camera angle presents as if you are on their shoulder, looking at the other. Giving you that point of view helps you take in every facial expression and understand how sedimental this visit really is. These scenes and many more, have made me love this movie and grow as a viewer, focusing on the cinematic works in scenes of movies. I recommend this movie to anybody looking for something compelling."
27,moonlight_2016,audience,3.5,p,Moonlight is a decent film. It is about a young African-American man who grapples with his identity and sexuality. Mahershala Ali and Trevante Rhodes give good performances. The screenplay is a little slow in places. Barry Jenkins did an alright job directing this movie. I liked this motion picture because of the drama.
28,moonlight_2016,audience,3.0,p,"I thought it was good, but i dont really have too much to say about it. it had a good meaning behind it but not a lot really happened throughout"
29,moonlight_2016,audience,4.0,p,"Barry Jenkins magnificent debut in three acts is a startling second feature of self discovery and self acceptance, with terrific performances. Deserving Best Picture winner at the Oscars, it's probably safe to say that, although completely differing films in every respect, without Moonlight, Parasite (UK-2020) wouldn't have taken the same gong this year."
30,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,It's a lot more meaty and soulful than you'd anticipate.
31,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"While being an excellent example of the power of friendship, Booksmart is also a warning to viewers that labels are dangerous."
32,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"There's something innately hilarious about watching the ""good kids"" losing themselves in bad behaviour."
33,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,It's at the top of the class.
34,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"Blending negatives with the swagger, insecurities, and skyrocketing emotions of teenagers, Book Smart ends up creating a positive concoction and an ode to friendship."
35,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"Booksmart is a movie about friendship, but it's also about how friendships grow and change as the people within them do as well."
36,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"Though it really shouldn't be at this point in time, it's exhilarating to see a film centered on teenage girls... Yet to champion the film as a universal reflection of teenage girldom rather than a highly specific fantasy also does it a disservice."
37,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"With elegant clarity, Booksmart demonstrates how certain experiences can feel colossal and of walloping import even when we know we're waiting for something else-something we can't possibly fathom."
38,booksmart,critics,rotten,n,A veritable grab-bag of high school movie conventions cranked up to 11.
39,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"Booksmart is a mostly sweet film that works hard to show the full depth of a female friendship. Showcasing two up-and-coming highly-talented actors, it's a movie that holds up well against other recent notable comedies."
40,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"It's certainly on the better end of the spectrum, but transcendent, it's not."
41,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,Like its main characters Booksmart is an overachiever that knows how to have a good time.
42,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"Refreshingly, the film's generous spirit extends to all its characters, whether geek or jock or cool kid. Unlike almost every other high-school movie, no one here is a mean girl in need of a comeuppance."
43,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"Fast, frank, graphically sexual exchanges populate the script, but it never becomes grating."
44,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"""With such a fully formed debut, it's hard not to fall in love with Booksmart. It offers laughs, tears and heart by the bucket-load"""
45,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"In the end, this is a movie you end up liking despite its faults."
46,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"A movie like Booksmart comes along to remind us that we were actually heroes, no matter what group we belonged to."
47,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"And Booksmart is incredibly smart to use a similar concept to tell a story that is much more at ease with itself, without trying to force a narrative."
48,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"An astonishing coming-of-age story that hardly goes by the books and honestly, it's hard to believe that this is Olivia Wilde's directing debut."
49,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,Olivia Wilde is a tour-de-force of filmmaking.
50,booksmart,audience,5.0,p,Yeah all time favorite! Can watch over and over again and will still be as funny as the first time.
51,booksmart,audience,3.0,p,"Overrated film.  The type of film critics love because it hits all the right (left) political buttons of moment.  It does not work.  Having said that, there are some funny moments, most from co-stars, most hilariously Jason Sudekis. Sudekis doubling as a principal and Lyft driver for extra income said more about US than all the other forced ideas.  The leads were okay, but not enough chemistry between the two.  It didn't quite work.  Overrated does not mean awful.  If you like teen comedies this one has enough moments to sit through (although I fell asleep in last act)."
52,booksmart,audience,4.0,p,"entertaining, funny, and smart, yet problematic at times"
53,booksmart,audience,2.5,n,"Sometimes fun but mostly cliche and riddled with an awful, distracting soundtrack, Booksmart does nothing new for its saturated genre."
54,booksmart,audience,5.0,p,An excellent film that pushes boundaries and is hilarious at the same time.
55,booksmart,audience,2.0,n,"Aside from the soundtrack, everything in this movie is subpar."
56,booksmart,audience,5.0,p,Definitely a must see.
57,booksmart,audience,3.0,p,I enjoyed this.  The two young actresses did a good job.  The humor was witty.
58,booksmart,audience,0.5,n,"For all it's buildup and praise,  felt like this movie didn't live up to any of it.
Everything felt very amateur, and for the life of me I couldn't find the feminism in it, the scenes & the acting were very bland. 
If this movie was rated like any other normal movie, the ratings would be a lot lower, but it's pedestal as the ""new feminism"" movie has it rated different for some reason.
Disappointing."
59,booksmart,audience,3.5,p,"Funny, but definitely leaned too heavily on copying parts of Superbad. Even using Jonah hills sister in the Jonah hill role. Give it a watch, but not likely something I'd watch again."
60,baby_geniuses,critics,rotten,n,"Aesthetically and morally, I can hardly name a more viscerally repugnant family film from the 1990s."
61,baby_geniuses,critics,rotten,n,A bad sit-com of a movie.
62,baby_geniuses,critics,rotten,n,One completely unwatchable piece of bottom-feeding dreck.
63,baby_geniuses,critics,rotten,n,"A thoroughly misguided, unfunny film."
64,baby_geniuses,critics,rotten,n,"There are ticklish moments, but no real laughs."
65,baby_geniuses,critics,rotten,n,Baby Geniuses' ramshackle plot serves merely as a launching pad for nearly two hours of jokes revolving around the idea of babies who talk and behave like bad stand-up comedians.
66,baby_geniuses,critics,rotten,n,Formulaic and deeply unfunny.
67,baby_geniuses,critics,rotten,n,The hokey dialogue and witless physical gags keep everything painful and hectoring.
68,baby_geniuses,critics,rotten,n,You can feel your brain rotting as you watch this.

79,baby_geniuses,critics,rotten,n,
80,baby_geniuses,audience,4.5,p,"As one that was born in 1996, I always considered Baby Geniuses as ahead of its time. It's basically an SNL movie for kids. As a kid and now, as an adult, I enjoy the detailed sets, sound track, and iconic humor featuring late 90's pop-culture. Sad to see this with a 2% rating."
81,baby_geniuses,audience,5.0,p,I loved this movie! It is dated in the best way. It's so earnest and sweet—and the babies are so cute. The theme is fantastic—some evil genius plan to raise super smart babies and sell toys. Why not? Watch it and tell me you don't like this movie!!
82,baby_geniuses,audience,0.5,n,"I watched a little and then turned it off, baby geniuses is just not my thing."
83,baby_geniuses,audience,0.5,n,"If you wanna understand why the concept of a live-action ""Rugrats"" just doesn't work, look no further than ""Baby Geniuses."" The movie's got NO target audience; it's too inane for adults, too advanced for kids. And it's so short, they tacked on a sentimental little music video at the end, but it ain't enough. Worst of all, you'll likely be put off by the fact that babies can't act. Because infants aren't developed enough to understand basic direction, they can't be told to look happy or sad, so the filmmakers just had slightly older voice actors do their dialogue and superimposed creepy-lookin' lips over their mouths for scenes that require them to speak. You'll possibly have more fun countin' the amount of times infants are blatantly replaced with young children in costumes rather than from actually watchin' this film; a scene where a little guy in a Elvis costume with a baby's head poorly pasted over his is the one that really takes the cake. Avoid this disaster, like the plague. AND THERE ARE SEQUELS TO THIS THING?!"
84,baby_geniuses,audience,0.5,n,"Well, the kids are cute.  There's that."
85,baby_geniuses,audience,1.0,n,"It tries to be family fun, but ""Baby Geniuses"" offers proof that bad jokes comin' from the mouths of babies ain't funny. So why not give it The Burnin' Medallion Of Badness? There's no way this film will work onscreen.

91,bloodrayne,critics,rotten,n,"A film that tries to convey a palpable sense of epic adventure and maximum exploitation of violence and sex, but which ultimately feels as relevant and important as a short film directed, written and starring cats and dogs. [Full review in Spanish]"
92,bloodrayne,critics,rotten,n,"At the rate Boll's improving, he'll achieve a film worthy of a thumbs up rating sometime late next decade."
93,bloodrayne,critics,rotten,n,"The fight scenes are the worst kind of editing-room cheating, meant to cover for actors who haven't been trained to wield anything more intimidating than a cell phone."
94,bloodrayne,critics,rotten,n,"Just when you thought camp was dead, along comes this bizarre cross between a Tarantino knockoff and a Hammer horror film."
95,bloodrayne,critics,rotten,n,Turgid drama and incompetently staged action sequences...
96,bloodrayne,critics,rotten,n,Only as bad as ordinary bad films and not as bad as getting your eyelid caught on a nail.
97,bloodrayne,critics,rotten,n,This is a movie that begs you not to watch it.
98,bloodrayne,critics,rotten,n,"BloodRayne is quite cheesy -- the costumes resemble something out of the cosplay closet, and the dialogue is often appalling."
99,bloodrayne,critics,rotten,n,"So how does a filmmaker bounce back from an almost universally reviled action-horror mistake? Well, if your name is Uwe Boll, you don't."
100,bloodrayne,critics,rotten,n,"All in all, not as bad as you'd suspect and certainly serviceable for all who love the bloody, low-budget vamping gone wild."
101,bloodrayne,critics,rotten,n,"The supporting cast is mind-melting: Michael Madsen is as out of place in this Medieval milieu as Meat Loaf in a hoop skirt, and Meat Loaf is just out of place."
102,bloodrayne,critics,rotten,n,It's as if Boll brought together the best team of talent he could possibly secure on short notice and then told them all to suck. And they do!
103,bloodrayne,critics,rotten,n,[Uwe Boll] is fast becoming known as one of the worst directors on the planet.
104,bloodrayne,critics,rotten,n,"When on-line petitions beg directors to stop making films, is that the beginning of the end?"
105,bloodrayne,critics,rotten,n,
106,bloodrayne,critics,rotten,n,"Who is Uwe Boll and why does he hate moviegoers so? The German hack, the one-man Blitzkrieg of Bad, is the worst filmmaker in the movies today."
107,bloodrayne,critics,rotten,n,"BloodRayne is a movie of unconnected plot dots. In the hands of director Uwe ""German Tax Dodge"" Boll, a simple sword and sorcery story with vampiric overtones turns into genre-jumping attempts to find an audience."
108,bloodrayne,critics,fresh,p,"It'd be a stretch to call the movie good, but at least it's fun-bad."
109,bloodrayne,critics,rotten,n,It's essentially a feature length version of what could have been told in a five-minute flashback sequence during a real BloodRayne movie.
110,bloodrayne,audience,0.5,n,This is proof video game movie adaptations are tripe.
111,bloodrayne,audience,0.5,n,"One of the most slow, boring and generic movies, I have ever watched."
112,bloodrayne,audience,0.5,n,Didn't start out so good and sadly got worse from there.  At least there was a challenge to it in getting through to an end that fulfilled all expectations of being ridiculously horrid.  Not even worth laughing at.
113,bloodrayne,audience,0.5,n,"I spent about 20 minutes watching this movie today on Prime Video.

Who do I need to speak to to get those 20 minutes of my life back?

To call the movie one dimensional would be implying that it has any dimensions whatsoever. Bad script, flat characters, cheap CGI and editing that was done by an intern on their first day away from school. And those are the movie's GOOD qualities."
114,bloodrayne,audience,0.5,n,More rotten than most movies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
115,bloodrayne,audience,5.0,p,OK.  It's a movie based on a video game.  But they decided to take the core idea behind that game and make a damn good action flick with some other elements mixed in.  Watched this a dozen times at least.  Does it deserve 5 stars? probably not I'd normally give it 3.5 but I just feel compelled to do something to offset such an injustice.
116,bloodrayne,audience,1.0,n,Somewhere in here is supposed to be the video games story right? I have no idea what I just watched but it wasn't Bloodrayne.
117,bloodrayne,audience,2.0,n,"The brave production setting has gotten further tainted by this disinteresting, abysmally performed, incoherently cinematographed mess, which is far from the better recommendations in both ""Underworld"" and ""Resident Evil"". (C-)"
118,bloodrayne,audience,1.0,n,"While better acted and boasting better cinematography than The House of the Dead, BloodRayne is still a shoddily made video game movie from the ""talented"" mind of Uwe Boll with a script that a 10-year-old could write in their sleep and action sequences that are just bloody and gory out of some misguided shout-out to Quentin Tarantino."
119,bloodrayne,audience,1.0,n,"This movie contains many sub-plots yet because it's based on a video game, it's also very difficult to say as side missions. Other than that, ""BloodRayne"" is not intended for fans of the video game, fans of movies, or fans of vampire culture, unless you want to find sex, this movie is for you. Uwe Boll explores an ambiguous study character, better than any Terrence Malick films about ecocriticism or any PTA movies about the meaning of life. This movie is like a drug; don't watch it too much."
120,battlefield_earth,critics,rotten,n,"It remains, genuinely, the worst film produced this century, as of 2020, and it is hard to imagine anything taking its crown any time soon."
121,battlefield_earth,critics,rotten,n,Lives up to the hype. This is the worst movie ever made.
122,battlefield_earth,critics,rotten,n,"Nothing so entertaining, albeit in none of the right ways, should scrape WOAT status. It's not even one of the 10 worst films from 2000, a distressingly dunderheaded year for movies in general after one of the best ever."
123,battlefield_earth,critics,rotten,n,A disaster of a screenplay meeting dreadfully overdone and under-thought filmmaking.
124,battlefield_earth,critics,rotten,n,Everything is preposterous.
125,battlefield_earth,critics,rotten,n,The plot is like a talentless adolescent's attempt to rewrite Spartacus as science fiction.
126,battlefield_earth,critics,rotten,n,"The plot is jumbled and poorly edited, the dialogue laughable, and special effects seldom appear so common. A performance by John Travolta in which he abandons everything that ever made him cool is the rotten cherry on top."
127,battlefield_earth,critics,rotten,n,"If you are looking for something to hate and despise, get thee to this movie."
128,battlefield_earth,critics,rotten,n,"Plan 9, at least, was a protest against nuclear proliferation --- what the hell is Battlefield Earth about? Is it supposed to be a tribute to man's ingenuity? If so, why is it so shoddily built?"
129,battlefield_earth,critics,rotten,n,Appalling.
130,battlefield_earth,critics,rotten,n,There are many things to make fun of here.
131,battlefield_earth,critics,rotten,n,A monumentally silly hunk of junk.
132,battlefield_earth,critics,rotten,n,"Logic is in short supply. Burned-out cities have electricity, for example. My favorite: A hangar full of jets, buried under 1,000 years of dust, not only fire up instantly but still have full tanks of gas."
133,battlefield_earth,critics,rotten,n,"The end result is a science-fiction saga so incoherent, so ugly and so pointless that you have to wonder why Warner Bros, is even bothering to distribute this embarrassment."
134,battlefield_earth,critics,rotten,n,"One can only hope for John Travolta's sake that his sci-fi epic Battlefield Earth was meant to be an uproarious comedy. If not, everyone connected with it is in deep, deep trouble."
135,battlefield_earth,critics,rotten,n,"Not awful, but pretty bad. A third-string Planet of the Apes meets Star Trek, Battlefield Earth is a largely uninspiring sci-fi adventure with a Swiss-cheese plot."
136,battlefield_earth,critics,rotten,n,From any angle this is a very ill-considered project -- an obvious contender for worst film of the year.
137,battlefield_earth,critics,fresh,p,"Overall, I liked the movie. I thought it was a good, mindless sci-fi flick with a lot of effects and action."
138,battlefield_earth,critics,rotten,n,"It's got bad acting, atrocious dialogue and plot holes you could fly a Harrier jet through -- but the result is more exasperating than comical."
139,battlefield_earth,critics,rotten,n,"The emphasis placed on indoctrination, enslavement and superior alien intelligence brings the film troublingly close to subliminal propaganda, while the script is so banal you'd have to be brainwashed to enjoy it."
140,battlefield_earth,audience,0.5,n,The absolute worst movie I've ever seen.  The only movie that I actually requested my money back.  It just sucked!  I wish a could give negative stars.
141,battlefield_earth,audience,1.0,n,Big disappointment for those who have read and loved the book
142,battlefield_earth,audience,0.5,n,Well that was a waste of my life. Its about as ignorant as those who practice Scientology.  This movie was horrible from script to acting.
143,battlefield_earth,audience,2.0,n,Hillariously Bad for John Travolta Movie
144,battlefield_earth,audience,0.5,n,"This has got to be one of the worst sci-fi movies I have ever watched, its right up there with other horribly filmed and rotten sci-fi movies!"
145,battlefield_earth,audience,0.5,n,This film is your typical Star Wars impersonator!
146,battlefield_earth,audience,2.0,n,"Yeah this movie was awful, with terrible acting, inept storyline, and random dialogue that made me think who wrote this down in a serious manner. But to be fair, I was hysterical at certain points, especially when he pulls out the head of ""your friendly bartender"". Don't watch this movie if you're looking for an actual science fiction movie.

Just all around terrible."

Despite the visuals (which is way better than most movies) and music, Battlefield Earth is a poorly executed piece of garbage with hammy acting, bad writing, over-usage of Dutch Angles, and Scientology propaganda are very nauseating and are the reasons why this movie is awful."

186,deuces_wild,critics,rotten,n,"It not only promotes every stereotype and invokes every clich of Brooklyn lore, it combines them all into an insulting composite, fuses that to the chrome-and-fins of the pointless Fifties, and then -- weirdly -- pretends it's Shakespeare."

This is cheap and unsubstantial ""entertainment"".  I've seen worse, but that doesn't make this movie any good.  It blatantly rips off of better coming-of-age gangster films like 'A Bronx Tale' ('I Wonder Why' by Dion DiMucci and The Belmonts is used in the opening scene). 
 A movie riddled with bizarre editing choices and dramatical theatrics that try to convey the ""seriousness"" of the movie's story but instead comes off as melodramatic and often times corny.  Frankie Muniz (Malcolm in the Middle) had no business being in this movie as his character served zero purpose to the central story.  Riddled with generic gang brawl sequences and an abundance of greasers punching each other in slow mo, this is a forgettable film.  It's a shame that so many familiar actors were involved in this squalor."

I liked the movie, the actors, the story, time period etc... in my opinion I think that this movie deserves a lot more love then it gets be kind to this movie give it a watch.

205,deuces_wild,audience,1.0,n,"It's like a 12 year old boy dreamed up this film and wrote the script. Very tough neighborhood dreamed up nonsense with a love story in it. That for scene in the park is ridiculous. There are a few good performances, by Reedus mainly. Tough cliche Italian neighborhood flick, again something I would have written when I was like 12 years old."

8,dark_tide_2011,critics,rotten,n,"Making Mega Shark Vs Giant Octopus look like Jaws, it is totally lost at sea."
9,dark_tide_2011,critics,rotten,n,What these filmmakers did was basically take all of [Jaws's positive] elements and found their polar opposites to put together a film that is one of the most tedious movie-going experiences of recent memory.

The attack scenes are poorly shot and you dont even care about any of the characters as they are all awful.  I love a good shark movie and can even get enjoyment out of the bad B movie one now and again but this is hands down the worst shark film I have ever seen - 100% avoid!"
21,dark_tide_2011,audience,4.0,p,"I love shark films and this one does a nice job of showing them in their natural habitat as well as what they're capable of. I've watched horror films my whole life and it's ONLY shark films that have ever given me the heebie-jeebies. The dangerous situation Berry's character puts the other characters into is unprofessional and unforgivable, and yet it's never addressed - I hate that in films."
22,dark_tide_2011,audience,1.0,n,"Dear God this is a boring and depressing movie! In all honesty I didn't even watch the last twenty minutes because I couldn't take it one more minute, even after watching most of it and that meaning I wouldn't know what happened. At that point I couldn't have cared less if they all got eaten by sharks, I really didn't care. I just needed it to stop. It is surprising to me that Halle Berry would be in such an awful film but here we are and man is it awful!!"
23,dark_tide_2011,audience,0.5,n,"I don't usually write bad reviews, but this movie has GOT to be an exception! This is perhaps one of the worse movies I have ever seen in my life! The acting on this movie made me want to rip out my eyeballs, slather them with STEAK sauce and EAT THEM JUST so I can never see this movie again! This movie is AWFUL! I don't say that lightly either! I love Halle Berry, but I don't EVER want to see her in something like this again! The plot was dumb! The effects were OK! The acting was AWFUL! AWFUL! AWFUL! Did anyone preview this before it was released? Did ANY executive actually think it was good? What was the director thinking? This movie was so bad that I can't even believe that someone edited this and said ""YEAH! We have a hit!"". NO! This movie literally has NO direction! It is like watching someone go to the bathroom. I am watching this on YouTube. I think it is even too bad for YouTube! It isn't a B move. It isn't even a D movie! It is a Z MINUS movie! The ONE funny thing is watching Olivier Martinez be himself - a hothead ready to fight! Other than that, if someone ever made me watch this movie again, I would KILL them and I don't even mind saying that out loud! Thank god I am doing stuff while I am watching this! If I went to a theater, I would be REAL PISSED!"

26,dark_tide_2011,audience,4.0,p,"I actually didn't think this movie was bad. I thought it was a solidly-good shark thriller, with a lot of real grit and a lot of impressive real, on-location footage with the sharks. Halle and the other cast, particularly Olivier and Luke Tyler, do a great job! I've watched it several times! Good music, scenery, cinematography, pacing--not bad at all. :)"

28,dark_tide_2011,audience,0.5,n,"This movie pissed me off more then a dozen times. One, sharks do  attack sometimes. Keyword sometimes, they DO NOT FUCKING ATTACK and come back to finish the job. I hate Hollywood for demonizing sharks and making them look like evil fish that just love human flesh. It is literally a fact that after an attack the shark never re-applies itself to finish the job. In the finale scenes where tommy gets his legs eaten and the dad is taken out of the water, in those weather conditions is absolutely absurd, and outright ridiculous! I have personally gone swimming with sharks. Not a great white, but many different breeds of sharks. This is utterly sickening and is upsetting, to a point where Hollywood should be completely shut down in the department of shark movies. This was so beyond what's realistic. They make these sharks out to be like some scyfy human flesh crazed  killing machine. I felt as though the acting was  goodd, had a good story line but was not thought or accurate at all when it comes to sharks. Overall I don't even give this one star due to the sheer shit respect the director and producer have for sharks."

80,strange_wilderness,audience,4.5,p,"I don't know what movie other people watched, but we found ""Strange Wilderness"" to be one of the funniest movies we've seen in a long time.  True, it's not droll British humor or humor likely to win any awards, but if you're in a sophomoric mood or have a few doobies under your belt, you can't beat it.  Steve Zahn's character reminds me of his performances in ""Saving Silverman"" and ""That Thing You Do.""  He's out to poke holes in other people being serious while trying to be serious himself at times.  The cast is stellar with appearances by Jonah Hill, Justin Long, Joe Don Baker, Harry Hamlin, Robert Patrick, and even Oscar-winner, Ernest Borgnine.  Yes...this looks like a movie that a bunch of guys put together on a napkin at a TGI-Fridays in one night, but it works.  They even make a joke referencing a part of the script that was put together that exact way.  Not sure where Jonah Hill was in his career when this came out, but, judging from his weight, I'd estimate sometime around ""Superbad"" but definitely long, long before ""Moneyball.""  Personally, I prefer the plumper version of Jonah as opposed to the slimmed-down version of late.  ""Strange Wilderness"" is about the son of a once-great naturalist broadcaster who is trying to carry on his dad's legacy on TV while ingesting lots of weed and coke.  Everyone around him shows signs of being in the same boat with nary a working brain cell to share among them.  I'm surprised no one took the concept of this movie and didn't try to make a direct to video nature show or a syndicated show like it.  Back in the 80s, there was a show where old movies were re-voiced by a group of comedians with hilarious results.  My favorite was when they re-voiced a Shirley Temple movie where her favorite doll was possessed by the devil who told her evil things to do to people around her.  Similar concept here:  the people on the show shoot real nature videos but their voice-overs make up facts that either are loosely true or flat out lies.  No matter.  They're hilariously funny either way.  If you don't believe me, call up the trailer on YouTube.  The movie is EXACTLY like the trailer.  If you don't like the trailer, you won't like the movie.  If you do like the trailer, you're going to love the movie."

He's saying the same funny jokes we like him doing and he's great. The story is kinda like a rip off high budget  version of Austin powers.

How can you not like a movie that has Randy Quaid, Hottie Rosario Dawson, Joe Pantoliano, Peter Boyle, Burt Young, John Cleese, Illeana Douglas, Jay Mohr, Jacynthe Rene (can you get me..) and the beautiful Pam Grier. It is chock full of stars of various fame set on the moon. The criticism of the language and sexual content is absurd. It is one Eddie Murphy's least offensive films of all. Everything is well timed. Love that french maid. Lastly the comparison to the fifth element. I have to question whether the critic ever saw the 5th Element to say that.

At least the comparison to the Matrix with the chase scene in the tunnels is acceptable. Still, it is explainable and fits the movie rather than a copycat. Did I mention the french maid?
Then the criticism of Murphy himself. He may be vulgar and a bit brash at times but he always gave a great performance. Then the cast around him... they are great. This is one of Dennis Quaid's best films as corny as his character may be, it is memorable. 
Forget the critics reviews. Enjoy this movie for what it is, a fun romp on the moon. Sit back and enjoy Eddie Murphy in a completely alien environment from any other movie he has made. It is well worth your time."
117,adventures_of_pluto_nash,audience,3.0,p,"Good watch, might watch again, and can recommend.

It's a little silly, but it's fine for an action comedy.  The only weird thing, really was setting on Luna.  Having on the its moon instead of on Terra didn't really add a lot to the movie except to facilitate a flimsy backstory and some scenes where people required environmental suits, and that had little payoff.

The benefits of being a sci-fi action comedy is to have laser effects for the blasters, and androids, which are used to various levels of humor.  

Eddie Murphy is great, and he plays well with Rosario Dawson, and if nothing else, you have to admit Randy Quaid is funny: the character would have been much different in someone else's hands.  I'll have to admit I thought it was Terry O'Quinn (""Lost"": John Locke), which made even funnier at the time, but it's a good job done.

Honestly, Eddie Murphy and Rosario Dawson feel a little big for their roles, but the story is good: a former smuggler turns legitimate business owner has to find the mob boss behind the people trying to kill him.

While I do think this is an average movie, it is solid, and I don't think I would go changing a lot to it.  I could see a couple versions of a reboot, but in 2020, they'd probably put it in the MCU."

It's a pretty grim testimonial to the failure of communism with everyone wearing horrible clothes, having manky teeth, looking undernourished, miserable, unkempt and repressed. In that sense, this movie is very accurate and consistent in its gloom. Jim Carrey's default is gloom ...unalleviated gloom....inconceivably so. Nobody could be that full of gloom and still function.

Like many movies set in non-English speaking countries, for some reason everyone speaks English with a foreign accent. I mean, this is just plainly and simply daft....a bit like the old war movies where all the Germans spoke in awful broken, accented English. And they're still making movies that do this??? So Jim Carrey speaks English with a Polish accent, as do nearly all of the other characters....... yep, if they were really Polish and for some reason living their lives speaking English to each other then, sure, they'd all do so with an accent to some extent. But these are supposedly Polish people, with Polish names, living in Poland and speaking their native language to each other.......so why the daft accent? 

I ended up fast-forwarding as it started to drag. Then reminded when I missed the punchline. And then thought.....""so what?""

21,bless_the_child,audience,3.5,p,I can see why the the low score as the movie does question the moral relativity of post modern thought. But it is a entertaining movie if you like cult or religious horror. The score is so aggressive it makes you wonder if the premise of the film is accurate.
22,bless_the_child,audience,1.5,n,"With the ""direct from the bible"" plot and the atrocious CGI graphics, I expected this movie to be promoted to school age children in Sunday school to scare them into believing.  It certainly was not designed to scare any adults, or even raise the blood pressure.  The ending is comical and anti-climactic, the villain is a cross-eyed blow-hard who makes a very unconvincing servant of Satan.  A throw-away movie."
23,bless_the_child,audience,4.0,p,"Blame the low score on strong religious themes. The film is elevated above your average horror film, yet the film also doesnt try to avoid offending viewers by toning down violence. It also does it's best to show the goodness in the world."

55,one_missed_call,audience,3.0,p,"I'm a little surprised this movie was criticied to the extent that it was. That being said, I'm not going to say it was a good movie or anything, but I have TOTALLY seen worse. The acting wasn't that bad- it obviously wasn't even close to oscar-winning standards of course, but for the movie I think it was convincing enough. In terms of scare factor, it wasn't that scary. There aren't really any horrifying images either. Perhaps only in one scene that comes to mind. The part that was most disappointing are things in the storyline that just don't work for me:
1. The origin of this ""phone curse"". So we see that this originated when Ellie was locked in her room after getting caught physically harming her younger sister, Laurel. Ellie begins to suffer an asthma attack, who then desperately bangs on the door for help, then tries to dial her mother's number in her phone as she dies, thus beginning the phone curse, with Ellie's mother as the first victim. Not to look at it too logically, but when Ellie was first caught by her mother, hurting Laurel, I'm sure what (at least partly) brought on her asthma attack was the stress of getting caught and what this might mean for her. Obviously she has psychological issues, but perhaps she was scared her mother wouldn't love her anymore? Or she'd get sent away? Then her asthma attack begins, and she's panicking as she knows she needs medical help. She's banging on the door for her Mum to help, and tries to call her- again, for medical help, as she is in a medical emergency. So why on Earth would she even be thinking about starting some kind of ""killer phone curse"" when she's wheezing for breath and trying to get help? When you're on your last dying breath, you're panicking, and gasping for air, not planning out a whole (not to mention, supernatural) revenge. How a child would even think of that is beyond me- Ellie was pretty young. She had her issues, but she was just a kid after all, what gave her the ability to create such a curse?
2. After the cop is killed near the end of the film, we see an unfriendly spirit of Ellie approaching Beth (likely to kill her). We then see the saviour-looking spirit of Ellie's mother grab spirit-Ellie and pull her away from Beth, where we also see light (presented as the ""phone curse"") get sucked out of the dead cop's phone (which at this point would normally have already dialled the next victim) presumably putting an end to Ellie's cellular rampage. Yet once the spirit commotion is over, the late cop's phone dials the next victim's phone number. Why on Earth would you show a triumphant spirit, triumphantly end the curse, to only seconds later, just show the curse still active. Director just booked in a cheap ending.

Nevertheless, this movie still earns 3 stars as the premise was intriguing, and still fairly entertaining to watch despite the story problems. As far as horror movies go, there really is much worse than this."

The story isn't the LEAST bit believable, and the dialogue doesn't make much sense.

There's lots else that doesn't make sense about this movie.  Where the random barrels of fire around the underground basketball court came from remains a mystery to me, for example.

There was a period of time that this was the lowest rated film on all of IMDB.  While I don't think it is fair to call it the worst film ever made, it is terrible (though there is something oddly entertaining about how truly bad it really is).  It certainly has many ""so bad it's good"" moments."

116,crossover,audience,1.0,n,"Laughably bad. I remembered I use to love this film when I was 8 years old but now when I have matured into a teenage movie reviewer. I soon realize that this movie is complete trash that 8 year old me couldn't see. I want get through with the positives first. Ok I admit I was entertained but not in the way that the movie wanted me to be entertained. To make that statement clear, I was having a great time laughing throughout the movie. Another positive thing is that I feel for the two main characters because of their brief backstory and their complexity of characteristics/ personalities. And the last positive thing is that the street ball sequences are well choreographed and pretty cool. Ok now we are getting into the real juice here. The negatives are the poor directing overall. The very low budget sound editing is atrocious. The acting is pretty bad. Besides the main characters everyone else is either one dimensional or paper cut outs or even both. Sloppy editing especially when pointless montages occurs during the halfway mark. The pacing is undetected. The music doesn't fit into scenes correctly. Shaky cam and poor lighting everywhere!!! Throw away plot that is so generic is should become a plot for a TV soap opera. Actually, this is a soap opera but made into a movie. The movie is extremely predictable. Horrible dialogue that makes me die of laughter every time I think of it. Drama that you can care less about. All these factors drive this film down even more. I've seen potential but was just wasted by the wrong guys for the job. I don't hate the movie I just thought it was bad to the point that you can't take it seriously. Truthfully I won't watch this film ever again in my life. That being said I would recommend you watching this at least once for free. So you can get a huge kick out of this. Trust me this a great comedy disguised as a horrible sports drama. I want to give this film a F but I can't do it when I think of the entertaining aspect of it in the wrong way. Basketball scenes were pretty good too bad they only had only 2 scenes. Overall, I will give the movie 'Crossover' a D- grading."

So, you can easily guess how bad this was gonna be, and the person who doesn't read reviews before watching can tell how bad it is by the TITLE. Like WHAT does BALLISTIC: ECKS VS. SEVER mean? It sounds more like a bad shark movie!
Anyways, Banderas and Liu look cool, but everything is ruined in the action. Why is everyone running during the entire film, and why is a car exploding every few minutes??!!

174,highlander_2_the_quickening,audience,0.5,n,There should have been only one.
175,highlander_2_the_quickening,audience,2.5,n,"I saw the 2004 version, which apparently has updated special effects and is much more coherent and than the 1991 theatrical version. I went in fresh, not having seen the first Highlander, and unaware of this movie's reputation as one of the worst movies ever made (although I had somehow known through osmosis this movie isn't very highly regarded). I was pretty much lost during the first act, and I wasn't sure if that was due to having not seen the first movie, or if the narrative was genuinely confusing. Either way, a movie should orient you in the world and be able to stand on its own. I had trouble understanding the timeline, whether the Highlanders were from the past or some fantasy realm (turns out both), and what was the villain, Katana's, motivation. The world building was pretty flimsy as well. The Highlanders' world didn't feel lived-in, and the practicalities of living on an Earth without sunlight are hardly explored. Virginia Madsen's character grapples with the film's internal logic involving immortality, and her confusion basically mirrored mine. If the characters don't understand it, how can we the audience?

Having said that, I didn't think this was such a bad movie. I thought a lot of the shots were inventive, such as the wide shot of Katana walking through the Shield corporation's headquarters, and the rotating camera as Virginia Madsen climbed a spiral staircase. A shot of the city clearly involved heavy equipment to move the camera as this was made in the days before CGI. The premise and setting are at least creative, if underdeveloped. It is hard to hate a movie that is clearly trying, when there are plenty of other sequels that are cynical cash-grabs. Highlander II is basically a movie that tried and failed, which is probably why people find things to enjoy about it while marveling at its badness, while not exactly hating on it.

Although, about halfway through, I noticed an odd thing happening: I found myself being entertained by its over-the-top action and dialogue. Highlander II is an odd and confusing movie, but it is certainly not one of the worst movies ever made."
176,highlander_2_the_quickening,audience,1.0,n,"After recently watching the first Highlander film (from 1986) and being filled with the Scottish spirit, I was excited to see where the series would go. I had heard from many sources that Highlander 2: The Quickening was a huge let down from the original and that it was, in fact, a horrible film. But I always brushed those comments aside because I usually enjoy a good, brainless, fun action film from the '80s and '90s. I didn't get my hopes up at all though since I saw the 0% score on Rotten Tomatoes but I thought maybe it might still be at least somewhat enjoyable. How wrong I was. Not only is this film terribly made from almost all perspectives, it's not even enjoyable to watch in the slightest. The film is filled to the brim with ""comedic"" scenes that just made the film seem overly stupid and the overall feel of these little scenes did not work well at all with anything else in the film. It even makes the film seem a little cliche and out of date today since many of the later '90s action flicks also incorporated this awful, non-fitting, non-funny, off-beat comedic relief such as Judge Dredd in '95 and Demolition Man in '93 among others. The movie's biggest problem though is its infamous multiple plotlines that barely go together at all, most of which are just forgotten and never resolved or mentioned again, almost as if the only purpose of starting that plotline was to get a fight scene or a ""funny"" moment that just throws the pace of the film off. But, these multiple plotlines don't just make the film nearly 2 hours, they make the film incomprehensible. Nothing makes sense in this film, and while there are many things that don't make sense in the '86 film, at least that one resolved its plotlines and had a unique charm, which I will get to later. Sean Connery's character was completely decapitated in the first film just to pop up randomly in this one without any explanation. The entire time travel plotline was completely ripped from Cameron's '84 masterpiece The Terminator down to the imagery and shot framing that was used. The terrible plotlines also lead to many consistency errors that would take all day to list. The plotlines just make a massive blob and mess of a film that clearly was just a bunch of people throwing whatever ideas first came to mind into the script. The main plotline isn't even interesting or intriguing at all (this is the ridiculous ozone layer plotline for those who can't tell due to the hundreds of plotlines in this film). I just felt that with all these plots, there was so much that could have been cut out to shorten the runtime and just make the film easier to follow and more enjoyable to watch. I kept catching myself saying ""that could be cut out"" which doesn't lead to a good film. Some smaller problems with the film would be that in some scenes the music didn't fit at all, especially the runaway train scene. The set was very generic-looking for an '80s-'90s sci-fi dystopian film and compared to some others, like '90's Total Recall, looks bland and boring. The costumes were also very bulky and ridiculous and I would expect that from a film like this from this time but this was especially bad. Some of the editing was also very awkward and terribly structured. There were way too many cuts in certain scenes, specifically the runaway train scene, and in some of the fighting sequences the actors were out of frame preventing the audience from seeing the action. Also, there were way too many explosions. There seemed to be an explosion every two seconds and it just got very boring and annoying after a while. What makes this film especially bad is that it takes many of the mysterious things that made the '86 movie charming and interesting and just completely abuses them and takes their charm away. Another thing this movie lacks is the charm of the original. I missed the chemistry between Connery and Lambert, the bagpipe music (which makes an appearance in this film [The Quickening] and is, as said above, misused and doesn't fit entirely aside from reminding us of the good cinematography and images of Scotland in the '86 movie), the cinematography which was quite impressive for an '80s action film I must say, and just everything that made the first installment fun, interesting, and memorable. The acting was also not good especially from Ironside who seemed to be trying really hard to be an over-the-top Jack Nicholson (failing miserably, sadly). Lambert was ok in this film, he gives a much better performance in the '86 one and so does Connery. Connery was one of the few things I liked about this movie, he really did bring the mood up and the few scenes he shared with Lambert (and the suit tailoring scene) were fun and memorable, but other than that he seems to be completely wasted in this movie. The only other positive thing I have to say about this film is that in the opening sequence there was some good camera movement, sweeping across the opera house but again, it just seemed to drag on and extend the runtime. In a word, the best and shortest way to describe the horrendous waste of time that is Highlander 2: The Quickening is... messy."
177,highlander_2_the_quickening,audience,0.5,n,"Wanted to see how bad it was, sufficet to say - it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen to the point not even 30 minutes in I stopped watching, they bring back dead characters? They should have not made a second movie, and left the original as a stand-alone."
178,highlander_2_the_quickening,audience,1.5,n,"Highlander 2: The Quickening is a name so ridiculous that it serves as a perfect metaphor for the film itself. I seen the original not so long ago, and while I wasn't blown away by it, I still found myself engaging with its characters and enjoying its occasionally wacky storyline. The follow up seems to go out of its way to ruin anything good about its predecessor, and forever taint whatever legacy it had. It starts off by retconning the origin of the Immortals, then reverses the ending of the first film, then introduces some corporate espionage plotline that feels like it was lifted from another terrible sci-fi flick and carelessly dropped into this one. The story is a spectacular mess, the characters have unconvincing motivations, the script is lazy and the acting ranges from bored Hayden Christensen to sugar rush Nicholas Cage. The film is so confused and disordered that every 20 minutes could well have been written and directed by a different person. The villains were my favourite element by far. Not because they're compelling or intimidating, but because of the sheer volume of scenery they get to chew. Michael Ironside, who know from the start that the movie was going to suck, takes every opportunity to bare his shiny teeth and mug to the camera, and I was laughing throughout pretty much all of his scenes. He's cartoonish to the extreme, and John C. McGinley, doing a weak Orson Welles impression, is not quite as silly, but occasionally gets pretty close. I can't say I was bored while watching it, and the movie does pass by very quickly, possibly because of how baffled I was by it all. At the end of the day, there's much, much worse out there, but it's still a film that nobody really wanted to be in, especially when it was re-written, and it's long been confined to the ‘worst movies of all time' pile, where it more than deserves to be. If you're a ‘so bad its good' afficionado, Highlander 2: The Quickening is an absolute must see."

It's dull and repetitive, the lead's dynamic with this robo-alien thingy called Steel is nowhere near as entertaining as, to give an example, Venom & Eddie Brock, it's hard to get immersed in this world when it comes off as depressingly empty, I don't really care about the protagonist's daddy issues and the revelations and, most infamously, there's barely any action in this movie. Which, you know, tend to be the main selling point of a frickin' superhero movie, even in origin stories. Only one proper fight happens and that's near the end with minimal superheroics before that. No saving somebody from getting run over or the hero using some random criminal lowlifes as target practice, just stuff about a psychic connection while the actor screams and keeps telling his crush/girlfriend ""I'm sorry, I have to go"". I'd have hoped that Mattel's attempt to start their own toy-based movie franchise might have been raked over the coals hard by critics but sadly I have to agree that, if it weren't for it being immediately forgotten, lacking anything to help it stand out in a genre that, by the time this movie came out, was understandably being increasingly met with concerns that it would be in danger of getting oversaturated and dying a quiet death at the box office, it could easily have qualified as unequivocally one of the worst superhero movies of all time."

Director Stewart Hendler does the best he can with what he is given; a weak script and a measly $10 million budget. But he crafts a unique, fun origin story that's VERY pretty to look at with his wonderful color grading and cinematography coupled with some very creative sky replacements. 

If there was more faith in this movie and if Stewart Hendler had more resources, better people, and a budget the same size as your average DC or Marvel movie, I truly believe that he would have made the next Hollywood franchise-starter and added another unknown superhero to the public eye."

I did fall asleep during this, because I was tired, because I was watching it very late, but I think this could have some re-watch value, and get better on each viewing. Not very funny either. Also some really bad things written in that resulted in those parts being poorly performed. It's not Freddie Prinze Jr's best movie, either. But, it's not like, completely awful. I'm not surprised it has a three percent, though, even though if I don't completely agree with it."

Anyway, this is one awesome, and utterly quotable movie. In my twenties, I watched this movie repeatedly. The consistent enjoyment factor gave me a sense of comfort.  Anyhoo, F$&@ critics. The 0% rating is proof positive that they're clearly way too self important.

Watch. Laugh. Enjoy."

87,low_down_dirty_shame,audience,4.0,p,"To me, it's not an action comedy, it's just a comedy. And in that sense, it was a success. In the end, maybe it comes down to personal preference. Different things make different people laugh."

90,left_behind_2014,critics,rotten,n,"Cage is a practitioner of the Nouveau Shamanic school of acting but here he has dialled it down perhaps out of respect to the religious nature of the material, or perhaps he's saving the wild stuff for Con Air 2: This Time it's Biblical."

96,left_behind_2014,critics,rotten,n,This new film is a watered-down and somewhat changed version of the earlier movie with a bigger budget and not much else. There is barely enough undercooked scriptural theology to critique in the vacuous writing and painful acting.
97,left_behind_2014,critics,rotten,n,"There's no drama. No suspense. No real stakes, even, because most of the movie takes place after the Rapture already happened."

100,left_behind_2014,critics,rotten,n,"Ostensibly an exploration of biblical themes, Left Behind avoids any theological debate to revel unsuccessfully in the mass-hysteria created by God's Rapture."

The cat was entertaining, though. The worst out of Vanguard Animation's holy trinity of bad animated features they released in the decade and only stands out for how it, alongside the comparatively much better Shrek the Third, led to the decline of this specific type of spoof film."

Would have been a little bit better if the kids continued to talk but not much. This movie also could have been given a different name as it could have been just a romantic comedy featuring Travolta and Alley with the evil, horny female boss trying to take advantage of her sexy pilot. This movie tried too hard to involve the talking animals in circumstances they were not needed in. Fails on many levels. It is not even that funny, just sad.

57,twisted,audience,1.5,n,"Twisted (2004) : 3 out of 10: Okay I have questions lots of them. 1. Is Morgan Freeman okay? Did he accidentally read the script, fall out of his chair laughing, and hurt himself? Samuel L Jackson is playing the Morgan Freeman role. Doing a spot-on imitation of Morgan Freeman that borders on parody. It's like watching Christian Slater aping Jack Nicholson. 

2. Why does every man in the movie hit on Ashley Judd? She is sporting Hillary Swank's haircut from Boy's Don't Cry, she is a San Francisco cop, and she beats up men with a little wooden dildo. She screams not that into you. Not to mention that Miss Judd is getting up there in years and as a screaming alcoholic has the sex appeal of a bag lady. (How did Ashley research this role anyway? Go to AA meetings? Hang out with her sister Wynonna?) 

3. Who the hell was the Korean lady across the street? I swore she had to be the killer I mean why else is she in the film? Why is this film rated R? Miss Judd keeps her shirt on, and the violence wouldn't make a network censor blush. Also, why in movies are all coroners quick-witted woman? I swear the last male coroner I've seen on screen was Quincy. 

Male coroners are as endangered as straight guys in San Francisco, which is vital since someone is killing all straight men in San Francisco all of whom have slept with Miss Judd's character. She has been blacking out after drinking, and corpses are turning up.

Her creepy new partner (Andy Garcia who seems to be in a completely different movie) is following her around, and she is seeing a psychiatrist who is also acting creepy. Other suspects include the aftermentioned Korean lady in the window and various cast members from the Practice TV show. 

When the killer is finally unveiled and gives his (or hers) big speech (instead of killing Judd and escaping needless to say) Well lets put it this way, when in 1979 Brenda Ann Spencer opened fire with her rifle on schoolchildren shooting 11 and killing two and then gave that famous musical trivia explanation for her actions ""I don't like Mondays. This livens up the day"" This was a rational, relevant, sensible and sound explanation compared to the psychobabble claptrap that ends this film.

88,one_for_the_money,audience,1.5,n,"Hot dang this movie is a train wreck. I think the main character was supposed to be quirky in a clumsy, hot-mess kind of way but Heigl really can't pull that off. She still comes off kind of uptight. Her accent is also kind of inconsistent. At the start of the movie Heigl's character Stephanie is mad at the male lead whose name I forget because he took her virginity and didn't call her back, yet as soon as he starts flirting with her she immediately caves. He doesn't even flirt with her or charm her or anything he just comments on her body and she's all over him. Regardless, the plot is pretty unimportant. This is not an action movie its a romcom. Most of the scenes are centered around the sexual tension that the two leads are supposed to have, but don't. Even when Heigl is naked and handcuffed. Which reminds me, the lead guy is kind of a jerk. Not just for lying to her, taking her virginity, never calling her, and then making fun of her for being upset about it, but also for breaking in when she's in the shower and then stealing her towel so he can see her naked, which is very violating. By the end of the movie their relationship doesn't seem to develop at all and they have the same dynamic as before. As for the original conflict, we're never given a resolution. He's never made to apologize or explain why he didn't call. I think adding this in would have allowed the two characters to have a more emotional scene where Steph admits that she was hurt and we see them being authentic with one another and building their relationship. Instead, Steph continues to deny being affected and the guy continues to get away with his actions. And after over an hour of watching the actors painfully try to feign attraction for one another we don't even get an on-screen kiss. What kind of romcom skimps you on the kiss??? Unless you're looking for material to add to a presentation about why Katherine Heigl sucks there's no reason to watch this."
89,one_for_the_money,audience,0.5,n,Well this is a poor film basically. It's nowhere near the bounty hunter an that was a bad film too. They built this movie up to be a more stylish role for Katherine but it just is worse than normal for her.

113,zoom_2006,audience,0.5,n,"Superheroes are usually meant for an older audience. But aiming for a much younger crowd, can be achieved, under the right circumstances. In fact, take a look at 2004's ""The Incredibles"", a superhero feature that caters to both adults and kids at the same time. Naturally, many other studios wanted to cash in on this type of success, and thus, Sony tried their hardest to make a superhero feature called ""Zoom"" in the year 2006. The key word being tried. Because, what ultimately happened was that this movie failed miserably, both at the box office, and with the critics. Is this statement true? Why, yes, yes it is. ""Zoom"" is an absolute failure from start to finish. From awful acting, poor pacing, and worst of all, a bad script that is based on a book, ""Zoom"" doesn't work in any kind of sense. There is nothing redeemable that makes it good; this is easily one of the worst superhero films of all time. Whatever Sony was thinking to turn this into a franchise, ""Zoom"" just wasn't it.

The story follows a group of kids that are recruited to a secret military base in order to become superheroes. These include two teenagers Dylan and Summer (Michael Cassidy and Kate Mara respectively), and two children Tucker and Cindy (Spencer Breslin and Ryan Newman respectively). Together, this quartet are being trained under the tutelage of a former superhero: Captain Zoom (Tim Allen). Unfortunately, Zoom doesn't want to do this, and wants to live his own life. As time eventually goes on, Zoom must find ways in order to make peace with these kids, as well as to be a part of a team once more. And in doing so, they must stop an old villain from Zoom's past before he breaks havoc onto the world once more.

""Zoom"" is a really bad film. And here's why.

The acting is awful. Not only just from Allen, who acts like he doesn't want to be here, but from all the other major players that are present in this production. In the movie, we also have access to bad performances from Rip Torn, Courtney Cox, and even Chevy Chase, just to name a few. The kid actors are all right, as are the teenage actors, but nobody turns out a decent performance, as they really don't seem to care whether or not they are here on the set or not.

This can contributed to the direction from Peter Hewitt. It feels like there is no sense of direction from him, as all the actors either do not care, or just do whatever they feel like. And this wasn't the first time Peter was behind the director's chair, but it nearly looks like this was going to be his last.

Next, we have the music. It's pretty much non-existent. What I mean by this is that while the main orchestrated score by Christophe Beck, it's mostly pushed over to the side by a pop soundtrack. Oh, and most of the songs in general are done by rock band Smash Mouth, because that worked so well with 2001's ""Shrek"". And even when the orchestration is being delivered, it's not that memorable. For instance, there should have been a lot more action pieces, but instead, we get more of a comedic tone delivered. What were they thinking?

The costumes and set design is also generic and boring. It's your typical lab coats and same matching outfits. Nothing really stands out.

But the biggest crime that the movie serves up is with its story and writing. The story combines a lot of other superhero origins from other narratives, i.e. X-Men and Fantastic Four for example, and it just doesn't work. There are a lot of plot holes, not a lot of character development, and overall, no major buildup to the final confrontation with the main villain. As for the writing,it's formulaic, predictable, and overall not funny. The main purpose of a comedy, is to be funny, but here, it feels like all of the humor is sucked out, and replaced with nothing.

The editing and pacing can be a real deal breaker here. At roughly 90 minutes, the film moves at rather fast pace, and there is no time for the movie to slow down or take a break. If the movie could have added a couple of extra minutes and taken its time, then we wouldn't have the mess that was produced. The editing plays a huge factor in this as well. Everything moves irregularly, and there are times when the editing just wants to do whatever it wants. That just makes this film even worse.

But the sad reality is that this could have worked. Something like could have worked out, and what we would have gotten, would be something good. Given the right direction and script, this would have turned out great.

But as it is, ""Zoom"" is a bad and terrible superhero film that tries is hardest to appeal to the younger demographic, yet ultimately earns its place in the bargain bin."

Actors who are mostly in it just for a paycheck, flat characters, jokes that miss 99.9% of the time and bein' rather boring. As temptin' as it is to draw comparisons with ""Sky High,"" I'm not gonna waste my time complaining 'bout how THIS movie serves as a reminder of just how bad that film could've been so...make it a point to never watch this film or show it to your children, and just get ""Sky High"" instead."

121,bucky_larson_born_to_be_a_star,critics,rotten,n,"I'm not sure how many tedious sex jokes and humorless physical gags people can take before they run out of the theater screaming, but Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star certainly tests the limits."

123,bucky_larson_born_to_be_a_star,critics,rotten,n,"Putrid and completely unfunny, 'Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star' is a torturous exercise for a viewer.

Turns out his buck teeth, bowl haircut and extremely small penis make him a new sensation in adult movies.  Ridiculous flick that doesn't take itself seriously.   Don Johnson, Christina Ricci and Stephen Dorff co star.  As silly as it is, you'll have as much fun watching it as they look like their having on screen."

148,bucky_larson_born_to_be_a_star,audience,3.5,p,"In many ways this is a formulaic comedy about an underdog exceeding all expectations, but there are a number of attributes that make it rather special.  It is a satirical answer to ""Boogie Nights,"" with its new performer on the porn scene who is ""special,"" and in this movie's case the title character being the polar opposite of the exceptionally endowed Dirk Diggler.  Meanwhile,  the director character, played by Don Johnson,  is an affectionate ""homage"" to Burt Reynold's character in ""Boogie Nights.""  More memorably, star Nick Swardson has created a character that is so naive and nice making him the brunt of all the silly situations, yet somehow retaining a sweetness, a likability in his interactions with everyone else, especially with his loving Midwestern parents and the charming, though hardly believable, relationship with the beautiful, kind waitress he meets. Christina Riici is outstanding here.  (In their first intimate moment, she asks if he has protection and he wonders if she means if he carries a knife.)   ""Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star"" is certainly not for children or those with delicate sensibilities, but its preposterous situations and dialogue will surely make you laugh."

150,problem_child,critics,rotten,n,Terrible. [Full review in Spanish]
151,problem_child,critics,rotten,n,"Sound funny? The filmmakers here think so. They've jacked this loud, lame shrieker of a movie up to the highest decibels, both aural and visual, and rammed it in our faces with almost numbing aplomb."
152,problem_child,critics,rotten,n,"It's misguided. It's not funny. And in its lame efforts to be irreverent and hip, it turns out to be just plain mean."
153,problem_child,critics,rotten,n,There is something offensive about using an unloved and rebellious child as the butt of bad jokes in this way.
154,problem_child,critics,rotten,n,"The end is refreshingly less sentimental than it seems to be shaping up to be, but the film's ugly moments can't help but leave a bad taste."
155,problem_child,critics,rotten,n,Some kids are born bad. Others achieve badness. And some have badness thrust upon them. The same can be said of movies.
156,problem_child,critics,rotten,n,"Smart beginning, witless ending."
157,problem_child,critics,rotten,n,"Inside Dennis Dugan's uncertainly staged, awkwardly sentimental Problem Child is another movie fighting to get out-one that's much meaner and probably more interesting."
158,problem_child,critics,rotten,n,Pipsqueak comedy that does not have the courage of its own convictions.
159,problem_child,critics,rotten,n,It's too bad the editors of Problem Child couldn't have saved time and money by just putting the whole film through a shredder.
160,problem_child,critics,rotten,n,The rest of the kid's tricks are too unimaginative to be much fun -- though with jokes this lame you won't have to worry as much about your children getting any bad ideas.
161,problem_child,critics,rotten,n,Antics of a diabolical child are neither valuable nor funny.
162,problem_child,critics,rotten,n,"The film gets so lost in angry pranks, it forgets to provide a reason why Junior shouldn't be hung from the nearest tree...The worst movie of all time? Problem Child."
163,problem_child,critics,rotten,n,Universal took a step in the right direction by whittling Problem Child down to just 81 minutes but didn't go far enough. The studio should have excised another 75 minutes and released this unbelievable mess as a short.
164,problem_child,critics,rotten,n,Enough to make you gag.
165,problem_child,critics,rotten,n,
166,problem_child,critics,rotten,n,
167,problem_child,critics,rotten,n,"Grating, irritating, truly a problem movie calling itself a comedy."
168,problem_child,critics,rotten,n,"As directed by the actor Dennis Dugan, everyone seems to be yelling their lines and making huge hand gestures instead of acting."
169,problem_child,critics,rotten,n,
170,problem_child,audience,3.0,p,a fun movie. for the children . I remember having a lot of fun. if you are an adult don't see it.
171,problem_child,audience,5.0,p,One of my favorite movies as a kid.
172,problem_child,audience,5.0,p,love this one! full of sweet sweet 90's style fun and fodder. slapstick for the win and John Ritter too!!
173,problem_child,audience,5.0,p,Simply incredible. Takes physical comedy to a new level.
174,problem_child,audience,5.0,p,Some good performances in a comedy that will terrify any parent to be.
175,problem_child,audience,4.0,p,"I think that the critics forgot that this film is aimed a children not 50 to 60 year olds.
I loved this film when I was young."
176,problem_child,audience,0.5,n,"In brief, I hated this movie. I hate this movie with every particle of my being and I will never cease to resent it. I hated it back when I was a wee lad with no moral compass, I hate it now, and I will always hate it. The plot is about a sociopathic, relentless psychopathic child who has been returned to his orphanage multiple times for awful behavior and wreaking havoc. Some couple that can't have children of their own decides to give him a chance only for him to continue being a Dennis the Menace rip off, an actual devil and a horrible individual to those who adopted him for one more time.
I have nothing to add to my review but hostility towards this absolute piece of garbage marketed towards the family demographic. It is horrible and mean spirited, taking the ""naughty child"" premise where no man has gone before. It does not hold back, everyone. It does not leave the elderly, dogs, cats, houses, criminals, parents, nuns, baseball teams and stores in peace. This absolute garbage of a character tornadoes his way through all of the aforementioned, causing chaos for the sake of non existent cuteness. And yet, after all of this destruction, the father remains adamant and still gives the spoiled little sh*t a second chance in the end, after he defeats the hopelessly useless and innocuous villains of the movie in a cute, comedic kind of way that always gives Junior an unfair and illogical advantage. Apparently the 80s-90s were the time when the concept of a child with a personality of a chainsaw was a nice chance for the creation of a cash grab with little attention to laughs, detail, acting, screenplay, virtually everything. The cinematography is bad, the acting is horrendous, the premise and screenplay is the worst I've seen in a while, and the execution does not help at all, how is a plot where a child gets his grandpa in a wheelchair supposed to even be considered funny to someone? Even when I saw it back then as a child, I knew it was wrong, I hate it. 
I have nothing more to add, everything about this movie is bad, there are no redeeming qualities, maybe some nostalgia value but that's basically it. I strongly discourage you from even considering watching this steaming pile of horse cr*p."
177,problem_child,audience,0.5,n,"Probably one of the worst movies ever made, would have given it 0 stars if I could."
178,problem_child,audience,5.0,p,"I've seen Nostalgia Critic's review on Problem Child. In his opinion, he says that it's a funny movie, and I tend to agree with him. It's fine if you all don't like it, but me and Critic do."
179,problem_child,audience,5.0,p,this movie was way ahead of it's time absolutely hilarious!
180,gold_diggers,critics,rotten,n,By turns pointless and pointlessly mean-spirited.
181,gold_diggers,critics,rotten,n,"The single punch line that sparks genuine laughter comes three minutes into the film; after that, these marriages are made in comedy hell."
182,gold_diggers,critics,rotten,n,"Nothing's quite so painful as failed comedy, and this atrocity is equivalent to a compound fracture."
183,gold_diggers,critics,rotten,n,"There's bad, there's unwatchable, and then there's National Lampoon."
184,gold_diggers,critics,rotten,n,"Truly this is one of the most off-putting, unpleasant and earth-shatteringly unfunny ""comedies"" I've ever seen."
185,gold_diggers,critics,rotten,n,...shockingly unfunny...
186,gold_diggers,critics,rotten,n,"If you watch this movie, you are an idiot"

188,gold_diggers,critics,rotten,n,Taking a trip to the retirement village and clipping grandma's toenails might be more pleasant that watching this film.
189,gold_diggers,critics,rotten,n,"Apprently, even gross-out comedy requires some delicacy."
190,gold_diggers,critics,rotten,n,"This is a lowbrow, low-budget homage to the Farrelly brothers -- and a pretty poor one at that."
191,gold_diggers,critics,rotten,n,"Really, words can't convey how horrible this atrocity is. Nobody involved should ever be allowed near a studio again."
192,gold_diggers,critics,rotten,n,"As abysmal as the film's concept is, the execution is unimaginably worse, a stomach-turning orgy of greed, lust, and sordid desperation..."
193,gold_diggers,critics,rotten,n,"So incredibly bad and astoundingly wrong-headed that it gets a star for its uncanny ability to make the viewer stare at the screen in glassy-eyed, open-mouthed wonderment."
194,gold_diggers,critics,rotten,n,"This is the spectacularly inept directing debut of writer-producer Gary Priesler, who is said to have 12 other movies in development. God help us."
195,gold_diggers,critics,rotten,n,"Please, Louise -- next time, less sleaze."
196,gold_diggers,critics,rotten,n,Writer-director Gary Preisler just plods through lame grossout jokes (most of them neutered to get a PG-13) that turn 87 minutes into an eternity.

198,gold_diggers,critics,rotten,n,
199,gold_diggers,critics,rotten,n,"You'll have already snuck into another theater, if you know what's good for you."
200,gold_diggers,audience,2.0,n,"It gets 2 stars for the two female leads because they are classic legend Hollywood Stars, as for everything else I can't erase what I seen, there is some funny parts with Rene but Rene is naturally funny and every time I see her I just think of the Nanny. Basically the ending of the film where she is sexy dancing to  My Boy Lollipop that is the funniest part she made so many sex jokes on the Nanny innuendos I mean when I seen her dancing to this with the cigarette I instantly thought of Morty and Sylvia her character from the Nanny.  Even in a pile of dung there is some good and I do think the two female leads Louise and and Renee had good on-screen chemistry the script was just garbage."
201,gold_diggers,audience,3.0,p,National Lampoon's have done much better comedies and this film's plot is ridiculous but I have to admit that I did laugh at some elements here. Will Friedle does well as a leading man in this movie and clearly tries to step out of his Eric Matthews character from Boy Meets World. It does go way over the top and tries to be as offensive as American Pie with Chris Owen who played Sherman in American Pie cast in Gold Diggers. I did laugh quite a bit here though and if you enjoy over the top comedies then this is for you.
202,gold_diggers,audience,1.0,n,"I am not sure why I even spent the time to watch this movie, but I knew what I was getting into."
203,gold_diggers,audience,1.0,n,I found it boring not funny.
204,gold_diggers,audience,3.5,p,a good comedy from national lampoon. good fun
205,gold_diggers,audience,2.0,n,"I did enjoy it while I was watching it a really stupid comedy that had all these dmb moments but after I watched it and thought back i thought this actually was a pretty bad movie, the idea was good and the two leads werent that bad but the movie just managed to fail. Is worth to the sherminator play a character who isnt a dork."
206,gold_diggers,audience,3.0,p,pretty forgettable but not bad.
207,gold_diggers,audience,5.0,p,everyone go see this movie
208,gold_diggers,audience,2.0,n,it was worth a watch
209,gold_diggers,audience,3.0,p,Gold Diggers was like watching 1 of those way over the top wacky 80's comedys.I can't believe I'm saying this but I actually enjoyed it
0,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"Unvarying in tone and style, it's a rough slog."
1,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,This gravely serious drama is as insular as a tomb with Muzak.
2,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"Hamm's and Lucas' performances are fine, but first-time director Anders Anderson is heavy-handed and overwrought, portraying emotional turmoil with clichs."
3,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"A leaden murder mystery with a clunky structure that swings back and forth between 1958 and 2008, Stolen wastes the talents of a reasonably good cast."
4,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"One poorly told story would be bad enough but with ""Stolen"" we have two."
5,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"Not a masterpiece, perhaps, but technically polished, with inspired performances and enough suspense that by the time Mr. Hamm found the redemption that freed him from his own demons, I was so wired I needed a Valium."
6,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"No one is able to make much of the disposable script, but Hamm is so limited by the period trappings that it seems as if he simply wandered onto the wrong set."
7,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"Plays like a middling episode of Law & Order: SVU, drawn out an extra half-hour and embellished with pretentious literary and cinematic flourishes."
8,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"Though generally ham-fisted, Stolen may appeal to Hamm's more die-hard fans."
9,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"Every bit the unpleasant slog one might expect, glum and murkily shot, wallowing in pedantic histrionics and badly lacking the breathing room it desperately needs."
10,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"The low-boil mystery-thriller Stolen was once known as The Boy In The Box and then Stolen Lives, but now has a title as nondescript as its contents."
11,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"Hamm himself is too smart a performer for movies like these, but let's write it off as a canny career move to take a vacation from Don Draper and his glumness."
12,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,[A] graceless piece of tragedy porn...
13,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,Anders Anderson's thriller struggles to intertwine the two mysteries and ends up doing justice to neither.
14,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"Not pretentious in its implications, 'Stolen' nevertheless depends excessively on coincidence, on unlikely connections and not clearly differentiated characters."
15,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,Stolen reveals a filmmaking hand in need of a considerable amount of seasoning.
16,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"In the lead-up to the inevitable connection, Anderson builds suspense around innumerable close-ups of telephone touchpads, liquids being spilled, [and] Lucas straining to be a credible hayseed."
17,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,A technically polished thriller marred by textbook filmmaking that grows increasingly dull as the plot wears on.
18,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,Two missing children stories are combined to less than compelling effect in this sluggish thriller.
19,10012207-stolen,critics,rotten,n,"None of the actors make much of an impression in Stolen. But then, neither does the film itself."
20,10012207-stolen,audience,0.5,n,"With plot points ""Stolen"" from countless superior films, this would-be thriller squanders a solid cast on overly serious and suspense-free storytelling."
21,10012207-stolen,audience,2.0,n,Surprisingly boring drama with a fantastic cast and a terrible script.
22,10012207-stolen,audience,2.5,n,Hamm and Lucas do good work in this typical thriller that is pretty paint by numbers fare.

39,pinocchio,critics,rotten,n,Better this log-headed Pinocchio had been burned at the stake.
40,pinocchio,critics,rotten,n,Every good actor needs to do his or her own Hamlet. For Benigni it wasn't Shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but Pinocchio. It might as well have been Problem Child IV.
41,pinocchio,critics,rotten,n,"What's most incredible is not that Benigni thought that he could pull off a believable wooden puppet who wants to be a boy, nor thet he could turn such a charming story into such a horrifically scary tale, but that the people of Italy love this movie so m"
42,pinocchio,critics,rotten,n,This overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary. Hmmm...might I suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener?
43,pinocchio,critics,rotten,n,"Benigni presents himself as the boy puppet Pinocchio, complete with receding hairline, weathered countenance and American Breckin Meyer's ridiculously inappropriate Valley Boy voice."

47,pinocchio,critics,rotten,n,"It's a frightful vanity film that, no doubt, pays off what debt Miramax felt they owed to Benigni."
48,pinocchio,critics,rotten,n,"If you saw Benigni's Pinocchio at a public park, you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police."

51,pinocchio,audience,1.0,n,"Roberto Benigni was not a good director for this film, does not have much comedy and can sometimes be unpleasant and uncomfortable"
52,pinocchio,audience,4.0,p,"This is a labor of love for Roberto Benigni and you can feel it right from the start. although it's a very different version of Pinocchio, there is a charm in this film that has always fascinated me. It may not be for everyone but this is to me a beautiful comedian dell'arte type of films. The performances are exaggerated, lots of mimétisme and body language, it's a farce within the farce, a love letter to old school films done in studios with lavish photography, colors and costumes.
The film didn't do well at the box office and was huge disappointment to many fans of the director, i personally think it's a beautifully crafted film."
53,pinocchio,audience,5.0,p,"I think this movie has been excessively criticized by modern bigots and people who are too much used to Hollywood shit.
This is an interesting and entertaining movie, seen with the eyes of a child, not an adult.
Benigni is funny and sweet in his portrayal of Pinocchio, is a fablesque kind of movie, and people saying ""it's creepy if a 50 years old plays a child in a movie"" are the kind of modern bigots that I talk of.
What is creepy about portraying something that you are not? There is nothing even remotely sexual in the movie, so that critique especially is really stupid.
I give it 5 stars to counterbalance the excessive downvotes this title had. I think it's an ok and enjoyable movie, to see with your childs instead of those modern animations without a soul."
54,pinocchio,audience,0.5,n,I can't bear to watch it.
55,pinocchio,audience,3.5,p,"I liked this movie, I think it is a good retelling of the famous book and catches the spirit of it. I think Benigni did a good job both as director and as the lead actor. It did not disturb me that he is an adult playing Pinocchio. One of the best versions to date."
56,pinocchio,audience,0.5,n,Funny for all the wrong reasons. The film is also surprisingly creepy.
57,pinocchio,audience,1.0,n,"Who Remembers Carlo Collodi's Children's Novel ""Pinocchio""? The Story About The Misadventures Of A Wooden Puppet-Boy Named Pinocchio & His Father, A Woodcarver Named Geppetto. Well, I Can Say I Was Introduced To This Story Through Disney's 1940 Animated Take On Collodi's Book.

I Don't See Anyone 1st Being Exposed To This Adaptation Here! Roberto Benigni's 2002 Live Action Spin On The Classic Story, I'm Sure It Meant To Do Some Good, Is Just A Flat-Out Awful Experience! I Can't Believe How Bad This Movie Is! The English-Dub Of This Italian-Made ""Pinocchio"" Adaptation Released Through Miramax Just Shows Us The Same Repeated Formula Of Pinocchio Always Getting In Trouble & Never Learning Fucking Shit! It's Constant Noise, Whining, Bitching, Animal Cruelty (To Donkies), & Annoyance! I'm Sure Roberto Benigni Is Not To Blame, Even Though He Was Not At The Appropriate Age To Play The Role & He Doesn't Look Like A Puppet, & It's Certainly Not Miramax's Fault For The English Dub Either! I Also Can't Believe That This Is The Closest Resemblance To Collodi's Original Book Than Disney's Animated Classic Or Any Other Adaptation, Which To An Extent I Guess I'll Give Some Credit. But Still, This ""Pinocchio"" Film Is Gratingly Annoying In Any Language Regardless.

I Feel Bad For Roberto Benigni, I Feel Bad For The Actors In The Original Italian Version, & I Feel Bad For The Star-Studded Cast Who Appeared In This English Dub. Although This Film Is The Closest To Carlo Collodi's Novel, Roberto Benigni's ""Pinocchio"" Is Horribly Casted, Ear-Gratingly Annoying, Cruel, Unenjoyable, Unpleasant, & Very Very Painful! It's 1 Of The Worst Movies I've Ever Seen! Top 5! This Piece Of Shit, Grown-Up-Wearing-Jammies-Looking-Ass Puppet Has No Strings For Which To Stand On!"

59,pinocchio,audience,5.0,p,"If I had to pick only one movie scene from the whole History of Cinema, I will pick Nicoletta Braschi (The Blue Fairy) saying to Medoro: ""E vero, Medoro...il tempo non esiste"". The movie captures the essence of the original Collodi novel and the cinematography is faithful to the early ilustrations of this beloved classic. The English dubbed version is horrible, though."

I just had my first viewing of this movie n i gotta say it was actually good , not saying this was John Candy's best movie but i still enjoyed it n i laughed, i keep seeing people try to compare this to blazing saddles, sayin how it doesn't reach the standard it set for similar movies to follow, but unfortunately as much as i like blazing saddles it's just a lot of kinda racist fueled jokes, i liked the fact wagons east didn't go there know what i mean? i posted a review video on my channel Stoner Watch Productions.... chk it \m/"

113,wagons_east,audience,5.0,p,"This is a fun and entertaining movie that is worth the watch. 
Mind you that it had to suffer the loss of the lead John Candy during filming, it had an entertaining cast and a different approach to the textbook western.

124,darkness,critics,rotten,n,"All of this, of course, would be forgivable if it added up to a scary movie or made even a lick of sense (chunks appear to have been cut out of a longer cut of the film), but Balaguero manages to disappoint on every possible front."

128,darkness,critics,rotten,n,"A plodding, portentous horror thriller in which a spooky child figures prominently and people speak in hushed tones about sinister doings."
129,darkness,critics,rotten,n,Darkness is a by-the-numbers haunted house thriller that recalls a number of other films in which a family moves into a mysterious old manse with a sordid past
130,darkness,critics,rotten,n,"There's still a lot of European feel to Darkness, which can sometimes be off-putting to American audiences."
131,darkness,critics,rotten,n,"Too many plot and character lapses for comfort, even in the traditionally logic-flouting horror genre."
132,darkness,critics,rotten,n,It's unfortunate that the film is called Darkness because this means it will soon be relegated to the Wal Mart bargain bin next to 2003's stinker Darkness Falls.

I remember when it came out on video--I saw it 2 or 3 times and thought it was just fine.  It was actually very good.  It's not formulaic, and I enjoyed the performances of the actors.

(B-)"
145,darkness,audience,3.0,p,"I actually don’t think this movie is as bad as some of the reviews. I admit I watched most of the movie before realizing it was the same one I had watched 15+ years ago. The ending is what kind of ties the whole thing together, imo, Yes, it’s not the strongest plot, the acting isn’t great but not terrible, but it’s a decent watch overall."
146,darkness,audience,1.5,n,"Unrated version:  Boring plot, generic script, mostly everything is terrible except the acting."
147,darkness,audience,1.5,n,"Terrible movie. Director Balagueró earns credit for visual style during some of the film's more creepy moments, but whether it be a side-effect of studio editing or a weak screenplay, this film is dull, predictable, generally unscary and features lackluster performances from its cast, with an ending that answers no questions and feels very unrewarding."
148,darkness,audience,5.0,p,"It's not about fear, it's all about atmosphere and....darkness.
A good story, with a strong climax and a solid acting around.
A must see!"
149,darkness,audience,4.5,p,"Probably the most underrated horror film, in movie history. Yes, some ideas are recicled, but atmosphere and dread slowly build up to an outstanding twist and ending, that gives the film, as a whole, a sense and a message, so disturbing, repulsion is a logical reaction to the film itself. A movie I will never cease to vindicate, and the promise of great things to come to Jaume Balagueró (REC), despite the - oddly - overrated ""The Nameless"", his debut film. ""Darkness"" has a great cast (Anna Paquin, Lena Olin, Giancarlo Giannini) and I will never understand why this film has been panned so much, despite its minor flaws."

202,code_name_the_cleaner,audience,0.5,n,Terrible horrible movie.
203,code_name_the_cleaner,audience,1.0,n,"I've always felt that it's a little problematic if your gag reel is funnier than your comedy film.  At least in films like this, that are designed to be as broad as humanly possible and 'as funny' as possible.  Chu and Blossom, a review that I wrote not that long ago, didn't end up being a hilarious movie.  I'm sure its gag reel would end up being funnier than the actual movie.  The point I'm trying to make is that this only applies to film where the entire goal is to be funny and not movies that have a story to tell with strong characters.  Who went into this movie expecting strong character development?  There really can't be anybody that truly expected that.  I know for sure that I didn't expect any of that from this flick.  I know I've always been a person who, at least, tries to go into films with an open mind.  Yes, I even believe I went into Jack and Jill and Grown Ups 2 with an open mind.  I think a lot of people expect to go in wanting to hate those movies, but I don't.  I want to like movies.  Why would I want to watch a movie that is gonna make me want to pull my hair out and make want to go on a crime spree?  I don't wanna watch movies like that.  When I watch a movie, as little hope as there is for that particular film being any good, I want to enjoy it.  I don't want to hate it.  This is one of those films for which there was little hope of it being any good.  That's just the way it is.  A janitor, who's lost his memory, thinking he's a secret agent spy, who finds himself in the middle of this conspiracy involving some computer chip.  How much do you think you can draw from this premise?  Then again, I suppose with a talented writer, you can get something out of anything, right?  Where do I begin with this movie?  I suppose let's start with its star, Cedric the Entertainer.  I'm sure Cedric is a very nice man and I'm sure if, he's given the right project, he can be an entertaining comedic actor.  I think his work in Barbershop speaks for itself.  But he's just absolutely obnoxious in this movie.  And not the type of obnoxious that Kevin Hart is supposed to be in, say, Ride Along, where he's still sort of endearing, in a way.  I think that concept can work and it DID work with the first Ride Along.  I'm not saying that it's a comedy masterpiece, but the dynamic of Kevin Hart being a tiny, annoying man versus Ice Cube's rough demeanor worked very well.  You don't have that dynamic here, Cedric doesn't really play off of anyone, well, at least until Lucy Liu comes into the equation.  And even then, it's still all about Cedric and not even necessarily the dynamic of his chemistry with Lucy.  I'll be perfectly honest, I found Cedric to be completely unfunny here.  I suppose that would have been clear when I said the character was annoying, but annoying characters can still be funny if they're well-written and/or the actor portraying the character does a good job.  Look at Adam DeVine's entire filmography.  This guy has made a career out of playing assholes that you just wanna punch in the face, but he's very entertaining at it.  Then again, DeVine's characters are supposed to be that way.  I don't think Cedric's character, in this flick, was meant to be annoying.  I'm assuming they were going for someone that anyone could relate to.  Let me tell you right now that they missed the mark completely.  Jake, the janitor, is particularly infuriating when he starts acting like a condescending dick to his 'girlfriend' Gina, who's undercover as a waitress.  Jake starts acting as if her occupation as a waitress prohibits her from understanding how serious his job as a 'spy' is.  He acted like such a fucking dick to her.  But that's not even nearly the worst part.  The worst part of this is, and this is the worst thing this type of flick can be, the fact that it's completely unfunny.  I get that this is not the type of premise that you can get a lot of laughs from, but you won't know unless you try.  They did not make any attempt whatsoever to make this an entertaining movie.  They relied on old and tired sitcom-y concepts and slapstick.  I'm not saying that slapstick can't work in a modern film, but you gotta know how to properly build to it.  Jackie Chan's works, at least his earlier films, relied as much on slapstick (inspired by silent film comedians) as much as it did on his martial arts ability.  He was able to combine the two to create a unique and entertaining style.  This movie uses slapstick because their script is shit and they needed something to put in trailers.  This really is THAT bad of a movie.  It would've gotten half a star if it wasn't for the fact that DeRay Davis and Niecy Nash made me chuckle a couple of times.  More the latter than the former, but I'll take the positives where I can find them.  This is the type of film that destroys careers.  Why do you think that Cedric the Entertainer hasn't received any major starring roles in films since this?  He also starred in The Honeymooners (which was released two years prior to this one and was also a critical and commercial failure).  Lucy Liu's career was on the downslide at this point anyway, but this movie certainly did her no favors.  Lucy and Cedric have continued to get work, of course, as supporting characters, voice over artists and other assorted TV roles.  So it's obviously not a complete career destroyer, but it certainly halted Cedric's transition to a major comedy film star.  And I can't say that I'm sad about that.  Cedric just did a shitty job in this movie.  He was annoying and he wasn't very funny.  Parts of that might not be his fault, in that he was scripted to be this way, but a good comedic actor can take shitty material and, at least, elevate it somewhat.  And I don't mean elevate to greatness, because that was never gonna happen, but I mean elevate it to where it's at least fine to watch.  Cedric failed monumentally at elevating this to 'just fine' status.  Perhaps I'm putting too much responsibility on his shoulders, but this movie still sucked no matter who was to blame.  This was terrible and no one should watch this under any circumstances."

[originally posted 6Mar2000]

Lesson one: never let the only person at the table neither of you has ever met choose the movie you're going to see that night. Lesson two: ""dinner and a movie"" these days must, by necessity, have the movie first. You can't plan a dinner to finish just around the time that movies start unless you make it yourself.

Once upon a time there was a rapper and his DJ. The DJ had written a movie script, and the rapper wanted to to star in it. It came out about the same time as eighty-seven-and-a-half other movies starring rappers, and there wasn't really much to distinguish it save the presence of an up-and-coming comedian who later went on to superstardom. And I don't know whether Chris Tucker is the reason, or something else, but Friday--written by Pooh and starring Ice Cube-- became a cult hit. It's still almost impossible to rent, years later, and when it shows up on prime time television, it gets ratings good enough to put it in the top twenty or so for the week. This, of course, makes Pooh think ""hey, my movie must be better than the rest of them. Maybe I should try it again.""

In one month, Pooh has had two movies pop up-- Next Friday, the sequel to Friday, and Three Strikes. Everyone and their brother has already panned the former, so I don't need to add my own thoughts. But I haven't seen any reviews of Three Strikes yet. So I still get to chime in.

The story revolves around Robert Duncan (Brian Hooks), a two-time offender who gets out of prison and, thanks to a series of misadventures, finds himself in a shootout over a stolen car. Knowing that he's going to jail for good if the cops think he's involved in some way, he runs, and spends the rest of the movie on the run from the cops while trying to patch things up with his girfriend (N'Bushe Wright), avoid the friends of the car thief/shooter he left in the lurch, and calm his dysfunctional family. The usual misadventures occur that one sees in a movie such as this.

And that's the problem with this flick-- it's the usual, the usual, and more of the usual. Some funny stuff, because Pooh really is good at writing comedy, but for the most part a lot of talented comic castmembers fall flat. David Alan Grier, as the primary on the Duncan case, falls flat in almost every scene. Vincent Schiavelli is completely forgettable as Duncan's parole officer, and David Leisure doesn't have enough screen time to really get his shtick into gear. These performances balance out the good stuff-- Wright, Faison Love as the all-too-likable bad guy, and Duncan's deadpan sidekick, played by... uhhhhhh... IMDB isn't listing most of the players here. D'oh!

In any case, it might be worth a rental. If you're a DJ Pooh completist or just like staring at N'Bushe Wright. Otherwise, ignore it and let it slip into the well-deserved obscurity waiting for it. **"

89,in-the-name-of-the-king-a-dungeon-siege-tale,audience,2.5,n,"""In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale"" is unlike any movie I have ever seen. Jason Statham is Farmer, a... farmer who is married with a wife and a son. Said wife gets kidnapped and said son stabbed brutally to death by some Poundland LOTR orcs controlled by Gallian, a villainous Magus played by Ray Liotta cosplaying as Liberace, who is allied with Matthew Lillard's Duke Fallow, who is the Prince John from ""Disney's Robin Hood"" through a filter of heavy drinking and excess melodrama. They wish to usurp the throne of the King, who is Bert Reynolds pretending to be Sean Connery in ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"".

Gallian also attempts to seduce Muriella, the terribly named daughter of John Rhys-Davies's Magus character Merick. He dresses like James Mackenzie's character from that old TV gameshow ""Raven"" and tries to prevent his daughter from getting involved in the plot. Despite this, she still dons armour, hangs around looking incredibly enticing to the queer femmes in the audience, and sadly doesn't get much of an Eowyn moment. Farmer's brother-in-law exists while looking like an off-brand cross between Legolas and Geralt and contributing very little to the plot. There are a group of elves in the forest who look like Peter Pan's Lost Principal Boys joined Cirque du Soleil and they can somehow control vines. This is never explained. The King's army has a platoon of ninjas. Ron Perlman is there.

If you're looking for something really stupid that you can roast with your friends while drinking heavily, this is the perfect film for you. Know what it is going in and you won't be disappointed. But you will probably feel a lot of vicarious embarrassment for everybody involved."

110,bolero_1984,audience,0.5,n,"Bolero is a perfect example of John Derek trying to be an Ed Wood wannabe in regards to making any type of film regardless of how erotic he wants to be. All John Derek did while directing Bolero is showing off his beautiful wife (Bo Derek). The plot and writing is just lazy, pathetic, idiotic, and pointless. Exactly one hour into this movie, Ayre (Bo Derek) got what she wanted yet we have to watch this trash for another forty minutes? Poor casting may I add. I mean come on. Bo Derek and Ana Obregón playing college students? There are a lot of nonsensical moments throughout the film like for example, Ayre jumped out of a plane (without a parachute) and survived...really? Idiotic writing at best. The acting was garbage as well. Bo Derek and Andrea Occhipinti were terrible. John Derek's directing is also awful. Especially since he thinks it's a good idea to have people do inappropriate scenes when they're not supposed to perform such scenes. That's just insane and idiotic. At the end of the day, Bolero is just awful. The directing is awful, the writing is awful, and the acting is awful. The entire movie is awful. Bolero should not even be considered a ""so bad it's good"" kind of movie."
111,bolero_1984,audience,0.5,n,"The first time I saw the movie Bolero, I thought it was laughably incompetently awful. Now that I revisit the movie for this list, as well as scan through John Derek's filmography, I noticed one thing in common. All of his movies are schlocky low budget films about sexual fantasies or contrived romances usually starring his wife Bo Derek. Bolero is another entry, except it's about a college graduate Mac (Bo Derek) who's excited to travel around the world and lose her virginity to either a Moroccan sheik (Greg Benson) or a Spanish matador (Andrea Occhipinti). This movie is extravagantly well-known for its awkward sex scenes, overuse of extreme close-ups, horrific acting and even worse writing and direction from John Derek. The sheik's storyline is entirely useless and only serves as the comic foil who drops asleep during sex and is forgotten for the most part. Angel the bullfighter is reduced to this one-dimensional hot bod who Mac ends up marrying at the end. Bo Derek, even though she does have an attractive body, is even worse as she delivers her husband's dopey lines in that dorky plastered smile even during the most dangerous situations. Bolero is not a movie, but an excuse to incorporate a director's wife in soft-core porn. This isn't especially surprising considering Cannon Group's sleazy reputation.

113,bolero_1984,audience,1.0,n,"Well deserving of its poor reputation. 

Set in the 1920s, a young woman sets out to lose her virginity.   Her mission leads her to a Moroccan sheik and a Spanish bullfighter.

Very weak, to the point of laughable.  Very basic, stupid plot.  Dialogue is pretty silly too.  Performances are in keeping with the general superficiality of the movie.

It's really just a skinflick with delusions of being something more romantic and serious.  

One of many movies written and directed by John Derek where he just used his young (30 years his junior) wife, Bo Derek, as eye candy.  The other ones (Tarzan The Ape Man, Fantasies, Ghosts Can't Do It) have met with similar low regard.

Poor George Kennedy - he really deserved better."

Later on, when a bull gores her gypsy in the nuts, she tries to cure his impotency by learning how to bullfight herself.  This is a terrible film that manages to fail even as dumb softcore porn.  Derek is a terrible actress who somehow manages to even ruin her nude scenes.  George Kennedy kind of classes up the joint.  Andrea Occhipinti stands around looking like Hugh Jackman.  Every time he was on the screen, I wished I was watching ""Conquest"" instead.  Olivia d'Abo makes her film debut, and has a couple of nude scenes even though she was only 15.  Don't watch this."

Svengali director and husband John Derek writes and directs this long, boring and uninspired movie as a Valentine to his wife and the salvating public. What it did was bring Bo Derek another Razzie! The 80s favourite nymphet plays a virgin again(like in John's Tarzan the Ape Man.)who plans to lose her virginity to an oil sheik but it ends up in disaster. Then she hightails it to Spain where she meets a hunky bullfighter, she finally gets laid and the bullfighter is injured for his troubles. She will make him walk and get his libido back in action, how? by entering the bullring, of course. When all is said and done your wishing you hit the eject button a long time ago."
118,bolero_1984,audience,1.5,n,"A disappointing and mediocre film directed by John Derek and featuring his wife, Bo Derek.

Her friends did a great job supporting her until the end and you also one friend pull away, as does happen sometimes in the face of inevitable tragedy. I agree they should have depi ted hair loss, as most people with cancer do experience it while only a lucky few don't, but other than that, this was a good movie.

We are informed that Marley is funny and likable, but none of her words or actions demonstrate this. I'm not sure why her friend lets her be alone with her kid so much, given she's the sort of person to ride a bike drunk in the middle of the street.

Our beloved Kate Hudson comes back to treat us with another witty,  heart-wrenching romance (as we have all come to expect from her). Kate and the fellow cast for this movie give us a cancer story like no other. As you watch Hudson's character (Marley) develop, you fall in love instantly. 

This movie has become one of my most cherished finds of all time. I have to say, I was very dismayed to see such a bad reception. The movie does drift away from the realities of cancer. AND THAT IS OK! I don't know anyone who would want to endure an entire movie of sadness and heartache without a little humor and zest?! I sure don't. Long story short, give the film a chance.

There is no point of Kerry Washington showing up looking like S&M barbie doll in this, and when stuff like this is stuck in otherwise great family films all the fudging time, you gotta question the choices of the filmmakers.

The acting is great and the story line is actually pretty good, there is very predictable scenes in this movie but I don't understand why someone would give this movie a one, like come on, there's movies out there that get an 80% on here and they straight up sucked.

The directors work is decent though acting is mostly mediocre. The best actor was Cam Gigandet that makes a clear effort to do his job right even with bad lines and a bad story to be a part of.

It was created purely for profit, without a care for its artistic value (or lack thereof). It genuinely upsets me that Friedberg and Setzer have the ability to make relatively high budget films, but instead make this crap....and still make a profit?

I was wrong, I was sooo wrong. You see, before now, I had never seen a truly horrible film before. You think the Emoji Movie is bad? So did I, and after watching this movie I feel like I owe everyone behind the Emoji Movie a heartfelt apology. 

Almost every character in this movie accept one is either void of personality, or so irritating that I want to shoot myself. There are extended dance numbers and monologues that do absolutely nothing to further the story whatsoever. And when I say extended, I mean it. Most of the jokes and gags are abysmal I can only cherry pick a couple of times where I actually laughed. The only reason  I give this movie one star instead of half a star is that I was truly astonished at how awful it was.

Is this what they wanted? Were the people behind this movie so brilliant that they created the single worst movie anyone has ever laid their eyes upon only so that suckers like me can get worked up and flock to rottentomatoes.com to vent our frustrations.

59,rollerball_2002,audience,4.0,p,Rollerball (4 out of 5 stars) Rollerball is a science fiction remake about a futuristic sport were tyrants are trying to increase the sport rating by having violent events. Chris Klein takes on the main character and did a decent job. The cast is good. Nothing award winning performances. There is plenty of mindless action to make this entertaining. It is bloody and brutal. The costumes of the sports teams are cheesy and weird. The plot is good. The soundtrack is heavy metal rock that is good. If your looking for a mindless action movie. This would definitely be recommended.

The story is stupid and boring, the acting is beyond dreadful even by the standards of Steven Seagal films, and the action sequences are tedious and uninteresting. Ultimately, it's too boring and lifeless to be salvaged as a guilty pleasure (Which is saying a hell of a lot coming from someone who liked Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever and House of the Dead).

The only one who was slightly good in this movie was Michael Pitt. The lead character (Edger something) I had seen before on the life story of Gianni Versace and he was good in that. In this he was awful. Though to be fair it was a horrible script and he probably did the best he could with what he was given. I don't recommend this movie to anyone.

A process server, Joe Tyler (played by Matthew Perry) is given the task of serving divorce papers on Sara Moore (Elizabeth Hurley), the wife of of a wealthy Texas businessman.  To do so he needs to contend with her attempts at evasion and the attempts of a colleague to undermine him.

You would think that the comedy of Matthew Perry and the allure of Liz Hurley would make for a decent movie.  They do the best they can, but are massively undermined by the script writers.  The movie is not funny.  The attempts at jokes are incredibly bad - even Perry with his great physical humour, timing and delivery can't make them work.  You can't polish a turd...

On the plus side (and it's the only plus), Liz Hurley does light up the screen and is a good distraction from the woefulness of the remainder of the movie.

Interesting to note that the supporting cast includes Amy Adams in one of her earliest movies.

Avoid."

It's unfortunately another boring example of why you don't need to remake a film that is already good or has achieved a cult-like fandom. 

There was a clear opportunity at the end of the original to continue the story, but sadly Wainwright was tasked with directing a regurgitated and embellished version of the original. I wanted to like it because Carpenter produced while Debra Hill updated the story, but why was it made at all?

Maggie Grace is a poor substitute for Jamie Lee Curtis as Elizabeth."

Also, there's just something better about horror when it's happening to dirty looking old people with bad haircuts and shitty cars.  Oh, they gave us pointless flashbacks instead.

110,redline,audience,2.0,n,One of the worst movies of all time. I've seen it five times.
111,redline,audience,3.5,p,It was fun race movie with more to than just racing. The story is not new but then they keep making movies that also have similar plot lines. But that does not make this any less enjoyable to watch. The racing scenes are good not great so is the acting. The cars are beautiful though and there is some great scenery around Vegas in the hills. Overall I did like the movie.
112,redline,audience,0.5,n,Just cartoonish  bad.....almost unwatchable.
113,redline,audience,1.0,n,"Skid Tires On Pavement before thinking about taking any risks involving snacks, friends and Redline because in the end the snacks will be all on you. Fancy posters, awesome wheels and one gorgeous woman is all this film has in store and nothing else. The cast is so jumbled up that you have no idea who's who and why they're there in the first place. Eddie Griffin is one of a few names you know from other movies like Undercover Brother and Deuce Bigalow and he plays a drag racing gambler named Infamous. He's good for the humor and his rare moments of acting, nothing else. The girl at the center of all this mayhem is none other than Nadia Bjorlin, if you're a Soap Opera fan then you'll know her as Chloe Lane from Days of Our Lives. Andy Cheng doesn't bring a whole lot to the table besides the lineup of cars and some i do believe actually do get damaged. Again the characters will have you guessing on who's really running the show, the story starts off as a no caffeine version of Fast & The Furious but somehow becomes the very cheesy made for tv entertainment to give Nadia more screen time.. If amazing exotic cars grabs your interest then by all means enjoy the movie, sitting through bad acting is the obstacle."

115,redline,audience,0.5,n,"To date, this remains the single worst movie I have ever seen.  I convinced my friend to go see it with me by using the rational that ""even if the movie sucks, watching a bunch of super cars race around will still be worth it.""  I was beyond wrong. Redline doesn't even give you the satisfaction of enjoying the cars.  A bunch of fast forward (literally, they FF the race footage) and CG bulls*** makes the race scenes laughable.  Actually, I hesitate to even use the word laughable, because you don't want to laugh.  You sit there and wonder how someone could ever finance this POS film as happiness itself leaves your body.  This movie is so bad it's like a dementor from Harry Potter.  Over the course of an hour and a half, it will suck all the happiness from your soul and leave you wondering why you just spent $10+ to get kicked in the intellectual nuts.  In short, Eddie Griffin's Ferrari Enzo crash is a perfect metaphor for this ""movie.""  It's something cool given to a person who doesn't deserve it and has no idea WTF they are doing, and then you have to sit there and watch them slam it into a concrete barrier, while somehow convincing yourself that a benevolent God can still exist when a Ferrari Enzo is dead and Eddie Griffin is not."

With adrenaline-pumping action and some of the rarest, most expensive high-performance vehicles ever raced and obliterated on film, Redline roars into high gear and doesn't let off the gas until the final explosive rush.

The dog died, no explanation and no follow up as the owner walks past the couple. Lazy storytelling, and relies on cliched rubbish and (no offence) really small boobs constantly being on show.

Fish out of water, 80s retro references - it could have been a good movie.  But everything else was awful.  The cliches, the acting, the cinematography, even the dancing.  Jamie Kennedy is supposed to be a comedian.  I don't think I laughed at all through this."
23,kickin_it_old_school,audience,2.5,n,"I decided to give this a ""slightly"" better score than the audience score.  There were many things that failed tremendously with this movie.  I think the concept was a good one, but it failed from a massively poor execution.  For one thing, the directing must have been at fault.  There was a pretty good cast and an interesting array of talent involved.  I'm what you'd call a die-hard Jamie Kennedy fan.  He's miraculously talented, but he couldn't help save this movie from the ash heap of mostly idiocy that it was.  Notwithstanding my harsh criticisms, I got some great laughs at certain parts of this, and that's partly why I'm willing to give it a slightly better rating than most.  Still though, I'd have liked to seen a much better overall end product.  The editing might have saved this a little bit more, but I bet it was a rough job to meld this into a final cut for release.  It felt like a B movie with some very funny parts, and with some absolutely abysmal parts.  The script writing didn't really match the individual actors very well.  The jokes and the timing were off, or just not so good in many instances, with a few very good exceptions of course.  Again, the core concept was a good one, but the script writing and the directing seemed to misfire hard on this.  Never-mind though, because I'm a Jamie Kennedy fan fo-life.  Maria Menounos looked amazing and she pulled off a likable performance as Jennifer in this otherwise drought of entertainment.  At best, to some, this movie might take on a cult status with a few who find the charm in this as an epic movie failure.  None of this is intended to be a knock on Jamie Kennedy.  He's given me so many outrageous uncontrollable laughs throughout the years that I gotta give him mad props.  I wish this movie had also been a hit because it might have given a boost to the idea of Stu Stone and Jamie as a rap duo.  They put out a good record that deserved some great credit, but it will almost surely be forgotten.  It was worth a once over, but I doubt I'll ever take the time to watch this gain."

29,kickin_it_old_school,audience,0.5,n,"""Kickin' It"" is a terribly written, terribly unfunny flick that relies on poor '80s and '00s satire, along with a cascade of fat, black, Asian and fart jokes.

None of the Cabin Fever movies were any good, not even the first one (I don't care how ""better"" it is compared to this), but this movie...I can't think if it's worse or even just as bad as the second one (the one with the prom/dance).

It's a note-by-note remake of the first one, which means everything you see in the first film is present here, with little to no changes (the only real changes are the deputy's change of sex, and the ""iconic"" pancakes scene). It tried to be more gory and horror, like The Evil Dead Remake, but it failed on that part remarkably.

This was one of many adaptations of old TV shows that came out in the 1990's, but it's tone is all over the place. This tells the story of 3 teenage delinquents, Julie Barnes (Claire Danes), Pete Cochran (Giovanni Ribisi) and Lincoln Hayes (Omar Epps). Who after various crimes and misdemeanors, face jail time, but when police Captain Adam Greer (Dennis Farina) decides to employ them as undercover cops, using the teen scene in Los Angeles as their opportunity to go undercover. However, when Greer turns up dead, Barnes, Cochran and Hayes are all on their own, with no-one to go to and help them. They end up having to stay one step ahead of the police, and using their cunning and ingenuity to try and find Greer's killer, but the police don't believe they're undercover cops. It's certainly not as bad as what some critics at the time made it out to be, but it could have been much better and it could have done with a more focused script and a more focused, tighter plot, because it ends up becoming a bit complicated and incoherent towards the film's climax."
117,mod_squad,audience,1.0,n,"Caught this yesterday afternoon on TV. While Omar Epps isn't a bad Lincoln Hayes, it pales in comparison to the old TV show, and there's a reason it is shown on Saturday afternoons or late in the morning, it's just so bad and incompetently directed. All the stars are going through the motions. 

In a way, I wish Hollywood would take another stab at the Mod Squad or at the very least a new smallscreen-version but maybe it's best to leave something that worked in its prime alone."
118,mod_squad,audience,2.0,n,"Average movie for a college date night. While the four lead actors do capture the essence of their predecessors, those not familiar with the 1968-73 TV series might not understand many of the characteristics being displayed. The middle of the film seems to have been heavily edited so the final half hour just seems to unravel tangled bits of plot that were barely explained. Thankfully done with realistic action scenes (unlike the Charlie's Angels or Mission Impossible reboots), this might have improved with additional films except for Farina's final scene - which axed that idea.  To sum up; good acting doesn't save the bad script under mediocre direction."

145,stratton,audience,3.0,p,"I watched STRATTON this weekend. Well, I got exactly what I expected. A generic, cliche, geo-political, conspiratorial, espionnage action thriller. I saw this movie with this exact mindset, and I got what I've come to expect.
So, the positive points with this film. 
Well, for starters, the action scenes are not bad. Yes, you heard (or should I say read) me correctly there. The action scenes are not at all bad in this film. As an action junkie myself, I've seen all too many movies with choppily-edited scenes, infinitely minute frame-rates and unwatchable shaky-cam. This movie, surprisingly, had none of those. It was just decent action, and dare I say it was even a bit enjoyable. So there you have it for action.
The actors are pretty good in this movie. I think that Dominic Cooper is a seriously under-rated actor, and he and the rest of the cast did a good job. 
The plot is thin but bearable. I mean, you can watch the movie without rolling your eyes out because of the plot.
Now, I only have three major issues with this movie.
The first issue is the lack of character development. Everyone in this movie is just blank. I mean it. They are all the same, and not even Stratton stands out. Look, here's an example. Stratton will risk his life to save millions of people or save a fellow comrade on the battlefield. However, later in the movie we see him tie up an unarmed man (who has a family, by the way), leave him in a building and intentionally blow it up, thus killing him. We literally have two opposing personalities, and I just couldn't help but noticing that characters were just absolute crap. Same for the villain. His motives are never explained. He's just bad because he is.
Secondly, the pace. Now, the action is good. We talked about that. Nevertheless, there were moments when there was serious drag in this movie, and it was boring. There would some cool spy stuff going on one moment, and the next Stratton would be having a casual stroll in the park with someone and talking about boats or the weather.
And last, it's the fact that this movie tries to take itself seriously. It is most probably low budget, and it decided to have a bio-weapon-threatens-to-destroy-London plot, international conspiracies, and even decided it was cinema-worthy. NO! This movie is not cinema-worthy. And whenever the characters even try to read lines to render the movie MORE SERIOUS, I nearly laughed, because it just DIDN'T FIT.
Look, this would have been a perfect direct-to-DVD film. It tries to take itself seriously. Does that make it a bad movie? Of course not. I even had a good time with this movie. But it's not something to get excited about. Watch it if you can find it on-demand, otherwise, you can leave this one be."
146,stratton,audience,3.0,p,"Opens like a video game. 
It's standard stuff. 
Worth a watch if there's nothing else on  
Doesn't tax the watcher"
147,stratton,audience,1.5,n,A decent cast just can’t be arsed to give a decent performance as they are let down by lack of budget and poor writing. Connie Nielsen English accent is one of the worst put to screen. Plods along I guess and is short so you prob won’t get bored you’ll just lose interest pretty fast so it becomes nothing more than background noise
148,stratton,audience,1.5,n,"While it is fun stupid action, exactly what you would expect. I find the lack of attention to detail to annoy me more than the stupid predictable plot entertains me. For example. In the first scene, the two operators both have grenade launchers on their weapons which you never would have in a black ops mission. And when they then get chased by cars none of them actually uses their grenade launcher. And in the boat chasing scene the sight he has on his gun is a holographic 1x sight, but when the viewers see the reticle it is a Russian style sniper scope."
149,stratton,audience,1.5,n,"Stratton has to be one of the most generic and boring spy thrillers I've seen, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Similar to James Bond, John Stratton is a main character in a series of spy thriller novels and this movie is based on that character (I'm not sure if this film is based off a particular book in the series or not). In this movie, Stratton and his partner are sent in to destroy a facility containing a deadly biological weapon, but things go awry when key intel is wrong and all the scientists and guards are already dead. Terrorists are waiting to ambush them and the deadly chemical ""Satan's Snow"" is already gone. Now, it's up to Stratton to figure out what the terrorist are planning to attack with this biological weapon and try to stop them before it is too late.
 
This is normally the type of movie I wouldn't bother watching. It seemed like something that would either go straight to DVD or you might find in a bargain bin, but I was looking from some movies that hand January 2018 US release dates and I noticed a few names I recognized in the film. I wouldn't call them A-list stars, but Dominic Cooper, Tom Felton, and Thomas Kretschmann are actors I recognize and have liked in sole roles. I didn't realize until after the movie that it was directed by Simon West who directed such movies as: Con Air, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, When a Stranger Calls (2006), The Mechanic, The Expendables 2, and The Rick Astley music video ""Never Gonna Give You Up"".
 
There are at least a few good things I can say about the movie. For one, I do like Thomas Kretschmann's performance as the main villain in the film: Grigory Barovsky. Kretschmann is a character actor I respect, even if it might be in more bad movies than good ones. He makes a great villain for the film and the villain himself is the most interesting and formidable character. This is one of those cases where a really good villain is wasted on a bad movie.
 
I found that by the third act came around; the film was more bearable to sit through. I wouldn't consider the action anything special at the end, but at least it was more acceptable compared to the first couple of action sequences in the film. The third act of the film really picked up, it's just a shame that it felt like a slog to get to that point.
 
I also like the opening theme of the movie. The music sounded like something you might find in a James Bond film. For reference, I'm talking about the music that's played when the studio logos are being shown. The next bit of music played during the opening credits is quite catchy as well; even if it was being played over clips liked looked more like a DVD title screen rather than opening credits. Unfortunately, the rest of the musical score or soundtrack in the film is bland and forgettable.
 
Everything else about this film was boring, forgettable, predictable, flat, or poorly executed. When the opening mission started, I was positive Stratton's partner would die on the mission. Everything about how the scenes played out and how the two of them interacted made the partner feel like nothing more than an extra that always dies on these missions. I was surprised he wasn't chopped to bits in the pipe they had to swim through. Instead, the movie had him die at the very end of the opening mission and tried to get us to care about his death. He felt like he was nothing more than an extra in the film, and yet the film wants you to be extremely sad or angry about his death, because apparently Stratton and him had a long history of being buddies and partners. I just found it incredibly funny when it cut to the escape helicopter rising up and Stratton hammering his fist into his partner's chest. Stratton karate chopping his dead partner's neck and then screaming in his face ""Wake up, Marty!"" was just the cherry on a hilariously bad moment. Stratton's partner isn't the only character lacking the character development needed for us to care. Practically every character, including our main character Stratton, is dull and has nothing to them that helps us care in the slightest. We learn virtually nothing interesting about Stratton or who he is as a character.
 
So, clearly this movie isn't a character driven story or a character study. The movie focuses on the plot and hopes that will be engaging enough. However, the plot is far too predictable and generic. It also doesn't help that scenes are film in such a flat and dull way. It's almost impossible to find the plot engaging. The only time the plot is remotely interesting is the final act of the film. The shootout at the beginning mission has too many jump cuts that it felt chaotic to watch. The car chase after the shootout had to be one of the slowest car chases I've seen on film that isn't meant to be a parody. If it wasn't for the hilariously bad moment of Stratton trying to revive his dead partner, I might have shut off the film and not bothered reviewing it.
 
As you can probably imagine, there is some really bad dialogue in the film, especially the ""banter"" Stratton has with his partner at the beginning of the film. The acting is mostly phoned in or really bad. One particularly performance has to be from Gemma Chan who plays Aggy in the film. Gemma Chan is good in Crazy Rich Asians, but I imagine she had nothing to work with in this role. She's so robotic and bland in this film. I might go so far as to say she had the worst performance in this film.
 
I really don't think there is any reason to see this film, especially when there are far better action movies and spy movies out there. It might not one of the worst films I've seen this year, but it's surely going to be among one of the most boring films of 2018 for me.

158,movie_43,critics,rotten,n,This is a film so utterly devoid of laughs that it makes one wonder whether Hollywood stars really are feeling the pinch too.

I've seen some of the shit you guys have rated better than this movie.... it's fucking absolutely hilarious... Who are you to make any sort of comment on something you have nothing to do with? Maybe you should go back through your rating history and look at the piles of shit that you've rated better than this movie...
172,movie_43,audience,2.0,n,"In film making, to break the rules is the key to create amazing new experimental products. Ultimately, it is the freedom of the film maker to bend and break the laws.

Fast forward six years and I am loading up my ‘favorites' list ONDEMAND with movies I've never seen or not seen in awhile.  After a year or two of waiting to be watched, it finally came on which means I didn't have to make the decision to watch it other than punch the channel number into the remote because I refuse to talk to my remote.  So, finally, I get to see ‘Movie 43' AND give it a review...

A loose satire of internet porn sites, it‘s a series of unrelated short clips covering everything from testicular misplacement, flamboyant child abuse, incest, defecation fetish, dirty talk fetish, sex dolls, cosplay, child labor, genital mutilation, torture, menstruation, blood, leprechauns, sex faeries, truth or dare, bbc, cartoon bestiality, to internet porn.  I have never had more of a headache or felt as physically ill watching a movie as I was while watching this.  It's actually a fairly competent and coherent satire but it made me physically ill, I did want to turn it off after 15 minutes, I was relieved when it was over and do not plan to ever watch it again."

177,movie_43,audience,2.0,n,"I love 'over the top' humor. The more outrageous... the better. I want a comedy movie to be in terrible taste. That said, this movie kinda sucks. Yes, it's way outside the bounds of good taste (hooray!) BUT It's too freaking JUVENILE (boo!). The jokes are like what my friends and I laughed at when we were kids. A girl getting her first period and staining the sofa just ain't funny. To be fair, I laughed about three times - one laugh every half hour - way too low. The rest of the time, I wondered how they got A-list Hollywood stars to play straight men/women in this silly production. This movie had the on screen talent to be a new Airplane! It's too bad it lacked experienced, clever, and imaginative writers."

""Miranda"" is there to deliver a $2-million ransom for the kidnapped daughter of a businessman (Clayton Day). But the deal explodes in his face, and ""Simon"" has to use his hand-to-hand battle skills to get them out of there. After escaping, they run into a beautiful blond (Emma Sjoberg) with martial arts skills that are pretty much equal to ""Simon's"". She also wants the suitcase, and it is pretty obvious that she and ""Simon"" has a past together. 

Back at ""Simon's"" place, he and ""Miranda"" discover that the suitcase is actually filled with two heavy metal bricks and a computer disc. The two take the disc to ""Simon's"" secret base under a French monastery where two computer experts disguised as monks (John Pinette, Ricky Harris) try to decode the encripted program on the disc. 

""Simon"" and ""Miranda"" then go after the daughter (Natalia Cigliuti), who is in love with the son of the kidnapper. And she doesn't even know that she is being held for ransom. 

Now, ""Simon"", ""Miranda"" and at least one unlikely ally join forces to get the girl back. 

Let me tell you something that will be painfully obvious with the first few minutes of the movie -- Rodman is the best actor in the entire cast, except for maybe Sjoberg. The problem is that the supporting cast just tries too hard to get a laugh from the audience, and their jokes just bomb. The lead villain is completely insane -- and not in a good way. He is over-the-top and not a good villain. And the reason he wants the disc is really lame -- he wants to destroy a famed French landmark because he is sick of looking at it. 

The other thing that makes this movie pretty watchable is the martial arts fights. The fights are nicely choreographed, and are at a good pace. However, you can tell when the cast is replaced by stunt people in these scenes thanks to how they move when they are obviously wearing a harness and their faces are being hidden by the distance of the camera, a body part or a prop they are holding. 

The writing is not that good in this movie. The plot twists are poorly done in this movie, and they come across as confusing. Some of the characters who appear to be a villains turn out to be the good guys, and their turn completely escapes you. 

Another problem with this movie is that there is very little chemistry between the cast. Cook is obviously being carried by Rodman on-screen, and he is obviously trying too hard to be the comic relief. On the other hand, Sjoberg and Rodman are a bit better on-screen, but I had a little problem believing that they were a couple prior to when the film takes place because there was no spark between them. It only became obvious that the two were attracted to another when they jumped into bed while having another martial arts fight. 

Special effects in this movie is fairly typical. However, they really were cheap with the computer graphics in the villain's super computer screen. This movie was released in 1999, but it appeared that the super computer graphics were done earlier in the decade. 

I would suggest that you only see it for the fight scenes and, shockingly, Rodman."

What did the people involved with this film think they were doing? Were they even thinking at all? Were their careers in such bad shape that they needed for this movie to be made? And even then, don't they have any decency or moral fiber to speak of? God help them all!"

68,mac_and_me,critics,rotten,n,"Possibly aware that they have something less than a classic on their hands, the makers of MAC and Me have cut their losses by making the film into a kind of cinematic billboard: all space is for sale."
69,mac_and_me,critics,rotten,n,"Everything about MAC and Me -- not least the fact that it's fairly well-made and involving -- smacks of crass calculation. The filmmakers even have the gall, in the movie's parting shot, to announce a sequel."

81,mac_and_me,audience,2.5,n,"Oh boy, oh boy. I've been looking forward to watching and reviewing this and I'm happy to be here finally. This movie is infamously awful and sadly it brings down ET's overall quality just by its own existence but at least ""Mac And Me"" owns it. Similar to other ""so-bad-they're-good"" movies like ""The Room"", Mac And Me knows that it's bad and knows that it's a rip-off of family classic ET, but here's the thing folks. Mac And Me doesn't care at all what you think of it. Where ET had moments of a beautiful friendship, Mac And Me had insensitive stereotypes. Where ET pulled at heart-strings and left viewers in tears, Mac And Me has a 8 minute dance sequence in a McDonald's restaurant. (by the way, the main character is in a wheelchair and forced to just watch as all his friends and Mac in a bear costume are dancing and having a good time. How rude!)

This movie is bad, yes, there's no denying that. But you know when we get a bad sci-fi movie, we also get a great MST3K episode covering it (which is actually how I discovered Mac And Me)"

As someone who generally dislike Nick Cage as an actor, he stands out here; I spent a good 10 minutes researching as to whether the guy with the glasses and bad nose and sloppy accent was him - and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was.  I've loved John Cusack, and wish he'd had a bigger role - but he was convincing as well.  The acting overall was better than I expected.

Criticisms include the overuse of gloppy blood being splashed around, and the occasionally thin script.  Some of the characters weren't fleshed out enough for me to care about why they weren't moral pillars of their communities.

Overall, though, this was a pleasant surprise.  Consistently gritty, and better acted than I would have guessed.  Will definitely recommend..."

4,staying_alive,critics,rotten,n,"[Sylvester Stallone] pours lots of energy but little intelligence into scads of short, sweaty scenes more suited to the rhythms of cable-TV ''rock video'' than to the wide screen."
5,staying_alive,critics,rotten,n,"It is a movie caught in a time warp: a slick MTV video that celebrates Eisenhower-era morality. For the Staying Alive audience, the problem is staying awake."
6,staying_alive,critics,rotten,n,Not quite a career low for John Travolta -- Two of a Kind was still to come -- but one he nevertheless would probably love to forget.

21,staying_alive,audience,4.0,p,"I find the critical reviews interesting in the fact that they are just as generic as they are accusing this film of being - projection much? As for the film itself, it's the sequel to SNF, which is like the challenge of all challenges. Yes there are other directions it could have gone, but ironically I thought the focus was smaller, which is the opposite of the complaints. This was a mature look at relationships and interactions between adults and had a lot more substance than the naysayers suggest. Sure there was a lot of dancing and music - duh, it's a musical people! If nothing else, I always find this film a very good view of what life was like during a healthier time, when men and women actually interacted as free adults, as opposed to today's dystopian existence where everyone is a non-gendered automaton. And icing on the cake is very sexy, good looking people doing some excellent dancing to a pretty hot Broadway show."

52,material_girls,audience,2.0,n,Even the gr8 director Martha Coolidge (Valley Girl) can't save this hot mess
53,material_girls,audience,0.5,n,"When I tell people that I watch any type of film, I really do mean it. Though I am a guy, I'm certainly not above watching chick flicks. However, that being said, chick flicks have also given me some of the worst film-watching experiences I've ever had that still scar me years after watching them. Sometimes I even shudder as I recall the experiences of watching them.

I know there are female viewers that try to say that these films are escapist entertainment, much like what us guys watch when it comes to action films or gross out comedies, but even the stupidest of those films still have some level of respect for their viewers, even if it is rather minimal at times. With a film like Material Girls, it has no respect for its viewers. It views its audience as a bunch of prissy, whiny, stupid, glamor-obsessed girls with roughly the same brain cell count as a cardboard box, while throwing in a half-assed moral message that means nothing in the end.

It's a film that thinks if it sticks popular (At the time, of course) preteen icons for girls into a film, fashion, annoying pop music, romantic cliches so lazy you'll want to vomit, pop culture references, and a gamut of other things that plague chick flicks, that it can just get away with being a piece of shit because of its ""target audience"" which is quite shameful. Oh no, Material Girls, I'm not letting you get away.

Sisters Tanzie and Ava (Real-life sisters, Hilary and Haylie Duff) are two rich girls who spend all their time partying and shopping, as they inherited their late father's cosmetics company, even though they do nothing to help run it. They are simply riding on the cash flow from the company.

But, Tanzie still dearly misses her father, even watching an old TiVo recording of him promoting his cosmetics every now and then and refusing to erase it, despite pressures from her sister to do so.

But one day, their lives are turned upside down when a tabloid program claims that the company's cosmetic products cause terrible skin conditions, threatening to destroy the company, causing their assets to be frozen, having an angry mob after them, and losing all of their so-called ""friends"" in the process.

While at home in their mansion, with an angry mob outside their gates, a fire is accidentally started, burning down their mansion and forcing them to stay with their maid, since their credit cards are no longer active and they can't stay anywhere else. They are now homeless, broke, jobless, and completely clueless as they have no idea how the outside works from their insular rich bubble of a world.

But, there is a ray of hope for the girls when a rival cosmetics company offers to buy their company for several million dollars. But, Tanzie refuses the deal, and decides to start an investigation into what is really going on at their company since she believes that they were framed, resulting in a series of supposed-to-be-funny shenanigans along the way as they investigate.

I do enjoy a good comedy about high society or takedowns of rich people (Including celebrities), but Material Girls is horribly dissatisfying in its storytelling. Even by the most minimum standards of chick flicks, this storyline is vacant and hollow, doing only the bare minimum to have a story and one-note characters so that it can be considered a film. There was absolutely no effort or care put into the storyline. This is easily one of the most lazily-written films I've ever seen. The average viewer, even if they possess no writing abilities of any sort, could write a script that would look Oscar-worthy in comparison to this script.

The two lead characters are nothing but two spoiled, bratty bitches, while the Tanzie character only has the minute elements of being a semi good girl sort of character who is also slightly smarter than her very dim-witted sister, Ava. I never rooted for them and I never cared, even when their characters seemed to become smarter and learned how to be semi-normal people.

Even with cast members like Anjelica Huston and Brent Spiner (Who also appeared in another horrible comedy, The Master Of Disguise. Were things really so bad after they stopped making Star Trek films for awhile?), the script does absolutely nothing with them, outside of simple caricatures, being possible lame villains, or red herrings in the story's abominable insertion of mystery elements that makes even the most generic of mystery films look masterful by comparison.

It also has absolutely nothing insightful to say about rich people, high society, regular life, clearing one's name from a false accusation, or anything all together. It's all about following two air-headed tarts who aren't even funny or interesting air-headed tarts (I should have Romy And Michele's High School Reunion again instead. Now that was a funny film about air-headed tarts).

The acting is horrible across the board. As much as I disliked A Cinderella Story, in which Hilary Duff was the lead star, I felt that she gave a good performance in that film and showed signs of being far more capable than what that film would lead the viewer to believe. Unfortunately, that aura is definitely not present in this film. Here, Hilary Duff is just annoying, though at least she's more tolerable than her sister. I'm not sure what sort of acting abilities Haylie Duff might possess, but she was beyond bad in this film. Together, they're both just annoying tarts that began to grate on my nerves within less than two minutes of watching this abomination.

Anjelica Huston is shamefully wasted and her presence is practically nonexistent, though she is probably the best actress of the bunch by doing another bitchy sort of performance, which was mildly entertaining at times. No other cast members are worth noting, other than expressing sadness over seeing the decline of Brent Spiner's career.

Entertainment? What entertainment? This film is so hollow and vacant, that even viewers with the most minimum standards for chick flicks will be hard-pressed to find anything of value in this film. It has only the most shallow elements of storytelling, characters so one-dimensional they are one step away from just being cardboard cutouts, horrible and unfunny jokes, and horrible acting. There is nothing to derive from this film other than brief moments of Anjelica Huston's performance which can be momentarily entertaining to watch.

Humor? Are you fucking kidding me? For comedies I usually try to have an extra paragraph to dedicate to humor, but there is not one positive thing that I can say about the humor. There are no funny parts.

Material Girls is a horrible film that has only a single redeeming quality thanks only to Anjelica Huston's performance. Other than her, there is nothing of value to find, even if you have even the most shallow of standards for this type of film. Avoid it at all costs if you want to keep your sanity intact."

The focus is on Nina's later years and her relationship with her assistant who tried his best to look after the singer and save her career.  It's a film with a strong decent lead and some very good music, it's just a shame that the rest of the film can't lift this up to the level of better musical biopics such as Walk the Line, Ray, Love & Mercy, Backbeat etc"

117,nina_2016,audience,3.0,p,"Nina is a by-the-numbers musical biopic riddled with every conceivable cliché about ""the tortured artist."" Nina never decides what it wants to say or where it wants to take us. Saldana (Avatar, Guardians of the Galaxy) is an accomplished and bankable actress, but she doesn't look much like Simone. That has led to several complaints, including from the Simone estate. A certain integrity and seriousness of intent gleams through, but Nina is just too big a subject, and talent, to be compressed into such a small package. Ignore all the politically-correct, blackface haters. Singing aside, Zoe Saldana delivers a decent enough Nina Simone impersonation here to make you wonder what all the brouhaha was ever about. Aside from some clunky expository dialogue and a few concluding title cards, the film barely goes into how Nina ended up so broken. It does try to give her a half-hearted redemption arc, but it fails to take off without convincing the audience why Nina needs or deserves redeeming. Zoe Saldana stirred up controversy by taking the title role, because she darkened her skin with makeup to play the part. That said, she acts with the right fire and sings beautifully and evocatively. During a long, uncut performance of ""Wild Is the Wind,"" one of Simone's signature songs, we suddenly see why jazz fans swooned at her feet.

VERDICT: ""In The Zone"" - [Mixed Reaction] These kinds of movies are usually movies that had some good things, but some bad things kept it from being amazing. This rating says buy an ex-rental or a cheap price of the DVD to own. If you consider cinema, ask for people's opinion on the film. (Films that are rated 2.5 or 3 stars)"

121,kings_ransom,critics,rotten,n,The wordplay of the title here is the only slightly clever element of this extremely lame comedy.
122,kings_ransom,critics,rotten,n,"The script, by TV writer Wayne Conley, shares some elements with the old Danny DeVito comedy Ruthless People, but humor isn't one of them."

124,kings_ransom,critics,rotten,n,Anthony Anderson shows he can star in a movie without a kangaroo in this kidnapping plan gone crazy.
125,kings_ransom,critics,rotten,n,"King's Ransom lumbers forth clumsily, choreographing its slapstick pratfalls with all the class and taste of a Courtney Love relapse."
126,kings_ransom,critics,rotten,n,"The thing looks like it was written in a week, directed in two, and forgotten about by all involved in less than three."

132,kings_ransom,critics,rotten,n,Basically an improv scene sprawling to feature length.
133,kings_ransom,critics,rotten,n,A mirthless comedy about venal people doing stupid things.
134,kings_ransom,critics,rotten,n,"Byrd's romp through the most contemptible stereotypes of women, gays, and ethnic minorities makes his film unfit for just about anyone, never mind royalty."

136,kings_ransom,critics,rotten,n,All these plots converge in a decidedly unfunny cacophony.
137,kings_ransom,critics,rotten,n,"Needless to say, as a cringe-worthy and excruciatingly awful comedy, you shouldn't pay a dime of King's Ransom."
138,kings_ransom,critics,rotten,n,"'Screenwriter' Wayne Conley's idea of side-splitting dialogue is to have characters repeatedly tell King to ""kiss their black ass."" Or announce that they just ""pooted."""
139,kings_ransom,critics,rotten,n,"Marital bickering, a mistaken-identity sex romp and booty shots galore follow, but few laughs."
140,kings_ransom,audience,3.0,p,"An okay comedy film that has some funny moments but can also be forgettable after you watch you it. The late Charlie Murphy was easily the best character in the movie and made me laugh the most of all the actors including Anthony Anderson, Jay Mohr, and Regina Hall. If you're a Charlie Murphy fan and want to watch something to remember him by I would recommend watching this along side Norbit and every episode of Chappelle's Show."

However, he's not the only one who plans to kidnap him for money. The plan fails and he ends up getting kidnapped by a guy who just needs some money instead of the brother of his mistress who kidnaps someone else instead. This had a lot of things going for it, but it isn't as funny as it should be. This could have been great given the cast, but instead it was mostly boring with some exceptions which were really good and funny. Too bad they couldn't fill more of the movie with that caliber of entertainment."

150,jaws_the_revenge,critics,rotten,n,"Jaws: The Revenge (1987) has that amazing Percy Rodrigues-narrated trailer (""This time ... it's personal"") and a sadly excised voodoo subplot, but it's also an attempt to give Lorraine Gary something to do after 12 years and too many folk lost."
151,jaws_the_revenge,critics,rotten,n,...an entirely misbegotten capper to a seriously erratic series.
152,jaws_the_revenge,critics,rotten,n,"At least, the onslaughts are a bit bloodier than before, and this 1987 production doesn't resort to unsophisticated computer graphics."
153,jaws_the_revenge,critics,rotten,n,"After all the dire reports of production delays, inclement weather and special-effects foul-ups, it should come as no great surprise that the problem-plagued ""Jaws: The Revenge"" looks like something haphazardly pieced together in a hurry."

155,jaws_the_revenge,critics,rotten,n,"The film is wholly unnecessary and adds nothing to the series, instead pulling the shark into weirdly supernatural, slasher-movie territory."
156,jaws_the_revenge,critics,rotten,n,"'Jaws: The Revenge' bears the marks of its rushed production, from the seemingly first-draft screenplay to its sloppy execution to the slender running time (under 90 minutes without credits) to the generally cheap look and feel."

160,jaws_the_revenge,critics,rotten,n,"Everything in Jaws the Revenge is utterly expectable, which isn't a bright idea for a film relying on suspense and tension."
161,jaws_the_revenge,critics,rotten,n,Let`s put it this way: When you see and hear the nasal Lorraine Gary on screen you want the shark to eat her.
162,jaws_the_revenge,critics,rotten,n,"A lot of the time, the people in this picture just stand around looking very sad, as if remembering happier days. Watching this sorry film, you know how they must feel."
163,jaws_the_revenge,critics,rotten,n,"Sargent's enough of an action vet to grind out a watchable sequel, but too much of a TV hack to turn the arbitrary dramatics into anything but synthetic pulp."
164,jaws_the_revenge,critics,rotten,n,The fact that you have to suspend your intelligence to even get through 'Jaws - The Revenge doesn't help matters. Is a shark smart enough to follow a person from New York to the Bahamas?

A film so poorly made, poorly written, and poorly acted that it truly cannot be comprehended without seeing it for yourself.  I will sum it up as best I can with this:  Jaws the Revenge makes The Last Shark look like Jaws."
172,jaws_the_revenge,audience,1.5,n,"Oof this is a rotten movie indeed. Sharks that can remember and track families across oceans and take revenge? Wtf ... in any case the movie is predictable, silly, and all around a waste of time. Stop with the first 2 Jaws if you're interested in this series and save yourself 3-4 hours."

181,feardotcom_2002,critics,rotten,n,William Malone's FearDotCom is one of those hopelessly muddled horror movies where you end up feeling more disturbed by the incomprehensible plotting and lurching camerawork than anything unfolding on-screen.
182,feardotcom_2002,critics,rotten,n,"The story is a mess, some of the images offensive, the acting under par and the dialogue silly."
183,feardotcom_2002,critics,rotten,n,The real torture in this vengeful cyber-spirit saga comes from having to sit through such ugly trash.
184,feardotcom_2002,critics,rotten,n,The pity is that there's an interesting thriller buried inside this concept.
185,feardotcom_2002,critics,rotten,n,"I figured feardotcom was gonna be bad news when I saw the trailer and noticed it was promoted with the line ""From the director of House on Haunted Hill""."

187,feardotcom_2002,critics,rotten,n,Awful but strangely endearing.
188,feardotcom_2002,critics,rotten,n,Feardotcom is the cinematic equivalent of spam in your e-mail inbox.
189,feardotcom_2002,critics,rotten,n,"Feardotcom is full of inconsistencies and contradictions, but none are more disturbing than the fact that not a single policeman wears gloves at any of the umpteen crime scenes scattered throughout the film."
190,feardotcom_2002,critics,rotten,n,"While such artlessness doesn't inspire shivers, it's definitely worth a few cheap laughs."
191,feardotcom_2002,critics,rotten,n,"FearDotCom was made with just enough craft to keep it from being the instantly dated camp howler its title promises, but it's quickly apparent that there's no thought or originality under its grim, familiar surface."
192,feardotcom_2002,critics,rotten,n,[A] shameless exercise in high-tech sadism.
193,feardotcom_2002,critics,rotten,n,The scariest thing about Feardotcom is that the movie ever got made.

197,feardotcom_2002,critics,rotten,n,"William Malone's fear dot com desperately wants to be a cutting-edge chiller with its 'up-to-the-minute' internet theme, but turns out to be a depressing up-chuck of every great horror movie of the last 20 years."

Self-assertive detective, Mike Reilly, and department of health researcher, Terry Huston, team up to uncover the bizarre causes of the deaths which have left New York police baffled. Whilst digging deep in the victims past, it is revealed all have died within 48 hours after viewing a site called FearDotCom. With a sadistic serial killer also on the loose, the detectives are in a race against time to discover who or what is killing the people of New York City.
When I heard William Malone had directed FearDotCom I was expecting a gripping psychological scare, especially after the success of his remake of House On Haunted Hill.  However, I ended up with gasps of boredom and annoyance as this film had such potential. Even after the success of Blair Witch Project, I can appreciate found footage films in the early noughties were relatively new, but it felt like this was an inconsistent version of The Ring, which was out the same year."

3,vampires_suck,critics,rotten,n,"With the level of humor here running to flatulence jokes, groin kicks and high-school smart-aleck cracks, their movie does, indeed, (surely no other critic in the world will be this clever) SUCK!"
4,vampires_suck,critics,rotten,n,"A witless, slavish pastiche of the series of romantic dramas based on Stephenie Meyer's Twilight novels. It is a knowing film that knows nothing about comedy."
5,vampires_suck,critics,rotten,n,"Vampires Suck, and films like it, not only fail to parody elements of contemporary society, they barely spoof the genre they are trying to mock."
6,vampires_suck,critics,fresh,p,"For the most part, the jokes are mildly relevant at least"
7,vampires_suck,critics,rotten,n,"I know comedy is subjective, so grant me that Vampires Suck just did not make me laugh. It probably doesn't help that, as a spoof on the Twilight franchise, it's making fun of movies I also don't enjoy."
8,vampires_suck,critics,rotten,n,"It's almost as cynical as the actual Twilight, and not nearly as funny."
9,vampires_suck,critics,rotten,n,It is as monotonous and predictable as rain in November.
10,vampires_suck,critics,rotten,n,All but the most die-hard fans can agree that the Twilight movies are spoof-worthy. So it's too bad they don't get a worthy spoof.
11,vampires_suck,critics,rotten,n,"An insult to other bad vampire movies, which is saying a mouthful."
12,vampires_suck,critics,rotten,n,"There are few things worse than watching a comedy flatline for over an hour, tossing its ""funny parts"" into a vacuum of uncomfortable silence."
13,vampires_suck,critics,rotten,n,A banal mess that sacrifices anything resembling satire for a series of smutty jokes.
14,vampires_suck,critics,rotten,n,Only Friedberg and Seltzer could film this dross with the belief they are making even a half-decent comedy.
15,vampires_suck,critics,rotten,n,Casting two lookalikes and coaching your young actors to mimic the trio from 'Twilight' isn't enough to make for a great parody.

17,vampires_suck,critics,rotten,n,"A movie that will have you pining to watch the real Twilight films. Yes, it's that bad."
18,vampires_suck,critics,rotten,n,"A witless, puerile spoof of the Twilight movies."
19,vampires_suck,critics,rotten,n,Vampires Suck misses its targets in spectacular fashion thanks to the directors' usual approach of simply recreating scenes from the original movies without any real understanding of what to satirise or even how to go about it.
20,vampires_suck,audience,3.5,p,"Mid-2000s spoof humor done right. Funny stuff but keep in mid how immature it can be. The actors did a wonderful job at imitating the ""Twilight"" characters. Especially the main character. I was laughing at her small mannerisms being duplicated perfectly."
21,vampires_suck,audience,0.5,n,"Like the title says, this movie sucks, and not in a nice way, like on the straw of a chocolate thick shake. It sucked like a dental assistant when you are getting a filing. Vampires Suck has a completely unfunny script that relies on endless unfunny attempts at physical humour and a few scenes copied straight out of old spoof movies like Police Squad. I didn't get one genuine laugh out of the whole movie. Save your electricity give this film a miss."
22,vampires_suck,audience,0.5,n,I do not care for slap stick un-funny or making fun of other movies so I give this movie a 1/2 star.

24,vampires_suck,audience,3.5,p,"I've never laughed out loud at a movie this many times before. I was out of breath at so many points and my cheeks ached by the end.

If you're looking for a plot, an original story and good characterisation, this isn't your movie. But if you want to be cackling for 80 minutes at a lame (but brilliant) parody, go right ahead. It's an overall remarklable experience and I'll definitely be recommending it in the future."
25,vampires_suck,audience,2.0,n,"A drastic improvement over the dumpster fires that were Epic Movie, Disaster Movie and Meet the Spartans, Vampires Suck keeps the focus mostly on what it's spoofing, there are more funny jokes here than in those last three movies combined, the production values could actually trick somebody into thinking this was the genuine article rather than a parody and the SeltzerBerg stuff is downplayed. Simply put, it's less cringy but since Twilight already had quite the hatedom back in its heyday, that isn't exactly a difficult task to accomplish. Too bad the movie still falls into the same traps as its predecessors of mistaking pop culture references based off of what's popular at the moment, explaining certain jokes, blatant product placement and stuff that makes no sense if you haven't seen the movies or read the books (*cough* Jacob's abrupt haircut change *cough*) for amazing comedy. In short, Vampires Suck sucks...much less than its predecessor but still doesn't do enough to escape from the shadow of the Scary Movie...movies."

27,vampires_suck,audience,5.0,p,"this parody I think better than twilight, a lot funnier and cool but cool because this movie has taken 10% on rotten I think it's very funny and I love it :)"
28,vampires_suck,audience,0.5,n,"Didn't know that it's possible to be worse than Twilight, but ""Vampires Suck"" is the perfect example. Its badly written, bored weird copycatish acted and badly produced, but it had a few (still bad) jokes that one might laugh about."

33,passion_play,critics,rotten,n,"Perhaps it's needless to say, but Rourke and Fox are a thoroughly mismatched screen couple, who exude zero screen chemistry with one another."

35,passion_play,critics,rotten,n,Peculiarly bad. It's one of those total misfires that wanders so far off the track that you're left scratching your head.
36,passion_play,critics,rotten,n,One of the funniest most pretentious art house flicks of the year...
37,passion_play,critics,rotten,n,"There's undeniable entertainment value in accidental absurdity, but Passion Play strikes a note of delirium that's downright painful to process."
38,passion_play,critics,rotten,n,The very definition of a cinematic curiosity: a movie that seems almost too strange to exist.
39,passion_play,critics,rotten,n,"Mickey Rourke recently made headlines for dubbing Passion Play ""a terrible movie,"" a proclamation that's ultimately most notable for its understatement."
40,passion_play,critics,rotten,n,This underworld fairy tale is so soggy and sentimental it's like a new genre: Hallmark noir.
41,passion_play,critics,rotten,n,"Black Swan meets Water For Elephants, sort of. And is Mickey Rourke's male cougar character's obsession with his leading lady's wings in this post-mortem noir, possibly suspect intimations of either bestiality or necrophilia? Who cares."
42,passion_play,critics,rotten,n,"The net effect is as if someone had set out to imitate a David Lynch movie without ever having seen one, or as if it had been directed by Wim Wenders (which is approximately the same thing)."
43,passion_play,critics,rotten,n,"Despite a gorgeous poster, a beautiful object of affection and cult-worthy actors, Passion Play fails to transform from a poetic pet project into a fully realized film."

45,passion_play,critics,rotten,n,"Screenwriter Mitch Glazer's directing debut is a romantic fable about love, redemption and exquisitely art-directed squalor whose evident sincerity is overwhelmed by its utter ridiculousness."
46,passion_play,critics,rotten,n,"""It's like a movie,"" someone says at some point. Yeah, like one. But not quite."

50,passion_play,audience,3.5,p,"The film is a commentary on lost souls and superficial beauty that belies the greater beauty within. Fox plays an innocent lost to fhe woes of a cold, heartless world, something the heartless critics can identify with. But it is only a fallen artist, one who's lost his ability to call on the beauty of the muse that once filled his soul, who sets her free. He comes alive once again as his angle reminds him of the passion he had once within. And it's in the saving that not only turns his world right side up but fully transforms the beauty of the inner angel to her fullest form. A story of struggle, lost hope and then that hope and passion reborn by two fallen angels who sore together in the end"

In fact, Bill Murray doesn't do well as a villain like he was in this movie. It doesn't fit him. The plot to the movie was tedious and pathetic. This was a complete waste of my time.

57,passion_play,audience,1.0,n,"The film strikes out, big time. It feels like the director was trying to make a David Lynch or Terry Gilliam type of movie here. He even tries copying their styles and it doesn't work. In a weird way the film kind of reminded me of the movie, Indecent Proposal.  The special effects weren't good here. The flying sequence and Megan Fox's wings looked too cheesy and fake.

There is a lot of miscasting here. I think they casted Rourke cause of Angel Heart. He was better in that film than this one. He has no on screen chemistry with Fox. Megan tries to do the best that she can on screen. Rhys Ifans is way over the top in his role. Bill Murray happens to be the best one here. He makes the film, watchable. I like when he plays villain roles, like in Mad Dog and Glory and Kingpin.

If you see this movie, then watch it for Bill Murray's performance."
58,passion_play,audience,1.0,n,"1/17/2014: A good cast, but a bad movie. Not enjoyable in any way. Down and out musician falls for young hottie with wings, but she gets taken by a mobster type. Interesting, but not put together well at all."
59,passion_play,audience,2.5,n,"This film is strange, make no doubt about it, but it's not terrible.  I enjoyed seeing Mickey Rourke and Bill Murray and Megan Fox was more competent than usual (maybe that's because she's playing a symbol rather than a character).  There's some gorgeous cinematography and scoring and the premise is unusual enough to keep my interest."

69,getaway,critics,rotten,n,"For all of its vices, I can't help but think that we've brought Getaway on ourselves. It's not the car chase film we need right now, but it's probably the car chase movie we deserve. And if the finale is any indication, a sequel could be ready to go."

85,getaway,audience,2.0,n,Getaway stars Ethan Hawke as a former race car driver whose wife is taken hostage by a mysterious voice that is keeping his wife.  He is given a car and given marching orders thru the streets of Bulgaria in the meantime he comes across computer wiz Selena Gomez.  Together they try to out smart the villain who turns out to be Jon Voight and to get back his wife before it's too late.  Unless you like the multiple police car chases and car crashes this is your type of movie.  Overall it was an okay movie to watch nothing great and nothing you will ever remember watching. You could skip this one.

87,getaway,audience,1.5,n,"Excluding a particular long take towards the end and some of the action, this entire film is hot garbage.  Ethan Hawke is ok I guess but isn't ever used to his true potential"
88,getaway,audience,2.0,n,"Story/Screenplay: (1.5/5)  Ridiculous.

Duration/Tempo: (2.5/5)  At 1 hour and 30 minutes, this is a short movie, which is good because it still felt a little long.  Good pacing, but the story line was poor.

Cast & Crew: (3.5/5)  Ethan Hawke and Selena Gomez did well with a bad story.  Enjoyed them both.

Summary: Overall, 2 out of 5 stars.  Our protagonist gets to drive a Shelby GT500 very fast for most of the movie.  This should be cool, but he's forced into reckless situations that put hundreds of other peoples' lives at stake.  Not cool.  This film had potential but failed to realize it."

117,alone_in_the_dark,audience,0.5,n,"Film adaptations of video games don't tend to be very good, but come on! This is one of the most abysmal, worst movies I've seen in years! The only thing that this flick succeeds in doing is being an incredibly horrendous and boring film. The acting is stale, the characters have no depth to them, the special effects are clunky, the dialogue is absolutely horrifying and the directing is even worst. But the worst part about it all is that the film's plot is just absolutely confusing. It makes no sense what so ever. This is the type of film which is so bad that it actually made me angry at the end. It's not even so-bad-it's-good material, it's just really painful to sit through. Overall, director Uwe Boll has proven to us that he hasn't got a clue on how to make a movie, and it's a very good thing that he recently retired from the filmmaking industry. This sorry excuse of a horror/action movie is an insult to cinema itself, and it rightfully deserves to be called one of the worst movies ever made. Stay away from this terrible waste of time..."
118,alone_in_the_dark,audience,1.0,n,"The worst film with Christian Slater. While he is the only decent thing about it, the rest of the movie is a chore to get through with it's horrendous CGI, bad acting from everyone else, and being so disgustingly boring."

Mischa Barton did a fantastic job and tbh I find  she's not very good in lots of her horror movies but this was pretty good! I see lots of people comparing it to Misery but I don't think it's like that, sure there are some similarities in one particular scene but after that I don't think it was anything like it.

179,the_darkness,audience,1.5,n,This had all the necessary elements to be a solid horror movie.  The main cast is solid with Radha Mitchell and Kevin Bacon.  The special effects are pretty good if a bit pedestrian and cliche.  There's just no there there.  It's less a movie than a pile of lame ghost movie cliches.  The plot is generic and predictable as is the ending.  The characters are flat and unlikable.  I kept forgetting their names while watching it.  They aren't the worst characters I have seen in a horror movie.  Competition for that title is intense.  They are pretty flat and nothing though.  The whole movie just doesn't amount to much of anything in the end.

(Mauro Lanari)"
58,playing_for_keeps_2012,audience,0.5,n,"Playing for Keeps is a really hard movie to like. I tried to find one positive thing to say about the film, and I came up empty. I can imagine even rom-com fans will have a hard time liking this film, as I'm sure they have seen many better ones.

The acting is serviceable, which is the highest praise I can give to this film. Playing for Keeps stars Gerard Butler, Jessica Biel, Dennis Quaid, Judy Greer, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Uma Thurman. Not a bad cast. You're not going to think any of them are bad actors/actresses (even the child actor was pretty good overall), but they're not really doing their best, and the chemistry between Biel and Butler isn't that great.

The problem with this movie is that it's very melodramatic. Playing for Keeps was directed by Gabriele Muccino, director of The Pursuit of Happyness and Seven Pounds, both decent movies that starred Will Smith. Though they were both very melodramatic, at least the movie earned some of the melodrama. Playing for Keeps does not because the lead character isn't relatable. He's a former football player (as a British person, the word soccer doesn't exist) who's down on his luck, but seemingly gets everything handed to him when he becomes a children's football coach, such as a job as a sports anchor and a Ferrari just because he's friends with Dennis Quaid. Kids love him, women want to have sex with him, men want to be him, and it's one of the most self-aggrandizing pieces of shit I've ever seen (with Butler also serving as a producer).

Dennis Quaid was over-the-top and annoying. He plays a supporting role as a rich, unfaithful businessman who bribes George (Gerard Butler) with what looks like a thousand dollars (my estimate might be wrong) so that his son can be goalkeeper and his daughter can sing the national anthem. Why is that so important to him? And his admiration for George just felt awkward.

The women in the movie are idiots, with Uma Thurman being the biggest idiot of them all, and her shrillness made her character really irritating. Not that George is any smarter because he lets his child drive a Ferrari on the road at what looks like 60mph. The women are idiots for comedy purposes, but I only laughed once. The tone was also inconsistent. It's a bland and slightly crude rom-com in one scene and a mawkishly sentimental family drama in another.

Playing for Keeps is a very basic rom-com where Gerard Butler tries to be more responsible and rekindle his relationship with his son and ex-wife. Of course, his ex-wife takes him back in the end because the movie didn't even try to give her fiance a personality. He does nothing other than open the door and greet Gerard Butler. There isn't even a subplot where he's suspicious that Jessica Biel might be cheating on him.

Playing for Keeps is a really bad film, which plays right into Gerard Butler's wheelhouse (I have yet to see a good Gerard Butler movie), but it's sad to see Gabriele Muccino sink this low. Playing for Keeps is a terrible rom-com that's on par with Gigli, and we all know what happened to Martin Brest after that film. Muccino's career is probably dead now because of this film, as his latest film (Fathers & Daughters) was a critical and commercial failure. Thankfully, I saw this film on YouTube as no one cares enough about the film to take it down and it helped me fall asleep. So the next time I need help falling asleep (because I do get insomnia), I'll just watch this film again on YouTube."
59,playing_for_keeps_2012,audience,2.0,n,"Playing for keeps is a pretty stereotypical romantic comedy. The movie comes across as entirely too predictable, but with an extremely diverse gamut of characters (this is not a good thing). I didn't understand about half of the characters in this film, as a matter of fact, I would argue that if you got rid of them it might actually push this movie to be slightly better. Gerard Butler and Jessica Biel are pleasantly average in their performances and the storyline is mediocre-ly interesting. 

Overall the movie was enjoyable, but definitely not something I'm going to be reaching for to rewatch anytime soon."

143,police_academy_4_citizens_on_patrol,audience,2.0,n,The only thing interesting about this movie is that Tony Hawk & Co did all the skateboard stunts.
144,police_academy_4_citizens_on_patrol,audience,5.0,p,Only deserves a 3 but jusus guys.  Funny as hell.  It could have been better but they decided to move out of the rated R range and they did what they could.  Still great for it's time.
145,police_academy_4_citizens_on_patrol,audience,2.0,n,"1987:  Commadant Lassard puts a plan of a Citzens On Patrol program for citizens, to be trained by our familiar police officers.  Naturally, Capt. Harris feels it is a terrible plan, and does what he can to thwart it.  The COP program is suspended, due to an arrest of an undercover cop.  However, the COP cadets are pressed into service with the regular cops, due to a jailbreak.  The program is saved.

The franchise is losing steam in this fourth outing.  Jokes are recycled from prior films, though there are still some sporadic laughs.  Billie Bird plays one of the COP cadets, who would be Tackleberry's dream mother.  The final scenes, involving hot air balloons and vintage planes, is shot well, but runs way long.  

David Spade makes his film debut here, as a young delinquent skateboarder, who is recruited into the COP program, to avoid punishment.  There is a skateboard montage; one of the boarders is none other than Tony Hawk.

OK for a watch, but nothing tremendously special.

Stars:  Steve Guttenberg, Bubba Smith, Michael Winslow, David Graf, George Gaynes, and G.W. Bailey."

Embarrassing for all concerned.  I wonder how this disaster escaped from the studio for public consumption.  My wife hated it more than I did and she selected it.

Fish out of water. Natascha McElhone. Well...her early performances were terrible. Over acting chops here. Here dialogue with Heather Graham in the various meets were just laughable. Mcelhone overacts considerably. Unrealistic. Continuity errors. The girl Heather Graham goes to see, the one who said Fiennes raped her. She smoked 3 cigarettes in 2 minutes. It was a magic cigarette, it changed length and restarted a few times. Also  how could Joseph Fiennes run at breakneck speed to apprehend some cardboard cliche thief who stole Heather purse.(he wasn't even with her at the time) he was watching her, he ran miles, got him and beat him up and there was Heather Graham at the scene in seconds. She had blood on her face? he snatched the bag he didnt hit her. then Fiennes proceeds to snog her face off.  Also the police turned  up out of the blue. Everyone knows in London a call to the police can take a few weeks for them to come out.  More funny than believable.  damn it to hell."

Apparently this was also a sequel to the Dorm Daze movies; that explains the horrible characters. The ""story"" isn't a bad situation comedy and the climax ended up being quite creative merging all the horrendous storylines together.

205,transylmania,audience,1.5,n,it's funny sometimes. Especially when 2 rusty met each other and about the music box also. But its story plot is boring and disgusting. The ending is really makes me sick.
206,transylmania,audience,1.5,n,"All I can say for this is this: This is about college student stereotypes, some of the roll call contains the straight arrow kid, the virgin kid who wants to get laid, the guy who can't tell a women and man and a pothead, send them to Translyvania of all places to allow hijinks to ensue. Let them encounter some supernatural things in the same time and here you go.

This movie is clumsy with it's story, scratch that, it doesn't even have one. It seems to try to base itself off it's gags more, like seeing a vampire get high off pot and such, watching a couple try to get laid while all this noise occurs. This is not even close to being engaging. Not even worth the dollar you put in the Redbox...
I remember saying this isn't even as funny as beerfest, which did in fact had some much more well-constructed jokes."

7,precious_cargo_2016,critics,rotten,n,This production clearly ploughed all its budget into a few slick action sequences and the cameo from Willis. It's a pity the film-makers didn't invest in the screenplay.

21,precious_cargo_2016,audience,2.0,n,"One of biggest examples of stunt casting you'll ever see. Aside from that, 'Precious Cargo' is poor in almost every area.

Mark-Paul Gosselaar is very much the lead actor, Bruce Willis barely features at all; and when he does, it seems he didn't give a toss about this production - I'm not usually one to say an actor is supposedly phoning it in, but Willis in this... oof. Gosselaar, for his part, is average. As are the rest of the cast, yet I kinda liked Jenna B. Kelly's Logan.

This attempts action, comedy and romance - none of which pay off unfortunately. The action is OK, though the comedy is extremely forced but not helped by lame dialogue. As for the love story, there is far too much - to quote the film itself - ""sappy shit"" in this. 100% action was needed.

I will say I appreciate that there is at least a male and a female character, both appear a large amount, that don't end up getting together, instead remaining friends. That's unusual with this sorta film. The score is actually alright, too. It also, unexpectedly, includes a blooper reel in the end credits.

Improved writing and acting could've made this work, if only on a minorly serviceable level."

Mark-Paul Gosselaar plays an older, bearded version of Zak from Saved by the Bell, and Bruce Willis plays the same criminal mastermind as in other similar movies.  The fight sequences are poorly choreographed and the action is mundane.  Relatively boring."

28,precious_cargo_2016,audience,2.0,n,"Painting by numbers Z list actioner starring the guy from ""Saved by the Bell"", the paycheck obsessed Bruce WIllis, and the chiselled jaw Claire Forlani. Forlani character most outrageous as she looks like a catwalk model but plays a criminal bank robber. Some generic crappy actioner involving some stupid boat chase and endless shooting.  I like the way the lead crew lead by Saved by Bell guy , their heist always seemed to go perfectly to plan. What ease they robbed a airplane with 500 million worth of diamond guarded by the keystone cops who went off chasing an ice cream used as  decoy.  Highlights? It ended. Nice beach walk at the endby the sexy Forlani added an extra half a star. Oh the outtakes were cringey at the end. Bruce has hit rock bottom."

56,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,The makers of the thoroughly terrible Mortal Kombat: Annihilation haven't even attempted to move beyond their source material -- the super-popular video game -- and actually make a movie.
57,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"Take the worst elements of martial arts movies, the worst elements of science fiction movies... and the cheesiest sets and special effects this side of Ed Wood. Mix them together and you have something called Mortal Kombat Annihilation."
58,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is not just a movie based on a video game, it is a sequel to a movie that was based on a video game. That pedigree should tell you all you need to know about the quality of this movie."
59,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,The sequel to the 1995 live-action video-game movie turns out to be idiotic but amusing low kitsch.
60,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"The filmmakers tried to get complicated -- and pay a price. The story lines are obviously designed to link the fight scenes, leading to moments of hilariously bad dialogue."
61,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is doubly insulting; a shamelessly lazy sequel and embarrassingly low-effort video game adaptation.
62,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"Mortal Kombat was the perfect level of cheesy badness, this is just... badness. It exceeded my bad memories of it, and lived up to its reputation, that's for sure!"

68,mortal_kombat_annihilation,critics,rotten,n,"The first sequel to 1995's highly successful Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat Annihilation adds little to the development of the saga except for a truckload of martial arts sequences and a whole mess of bigger and louder special effects."

78,mortal_kombat_annihilation,audience,0.5,n,"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation was flopped and the worst sequel to the first 1995 film. #1. Only Robin Shou and Talisa Soto, but with new actors.
#2. They killed Johnny Cage
#3. Shao Kahn is not the same actor from the end of the film.
#4. Too much actors.
#5. Jade is not supposed to be a villain.
#6. Mileena and Kitana should've been portrayed by Talisa Soto!
#7. It looks like a Power⚡Rangers movie which I'm old for that.
#8. Christopher Lambert, Bridgette Wilson, and Linden Ashby didn't sign up for MK: A, which i don't judge them.
#9. Doesn't have a good VFX & SFX.
and
#10. Bad CGI.


Bonus: Page 62, Johnny Cage dies, Is Someone High?"
79,mortal_kombat_annihilation,audience,0.5,n,"0.5/5.  Apart from a handful of amusing moments, this movie has nothing going for it.  The characters suck, the story is nonexistence, and the special effects are embarrassing even by 1997 standards."
80,mortal_kombat_annihilation,audience,0.5,n,Can't believe this hot mess was ever produced. The special effects are shockingly bad.

108,speed_2_cruise_control,audience,1.5,n,"Woof!  This movie is a terrible follow up to the original action classic SPEED.  It has one of the worst villains of all time, played by the great Willem Dafoe.  He is a computer genius that has terminal cancer...who puts leeches on his body to prolong his life.  Who came up with this character?  Jason Patric is dull as usual with his extremely limited acting range.  He makes Keanu Reeves look like Christian Bale. Sandra Bullock is also equally as bad, but hey I'm sure she got a big payday for this piece of garbage."

The rest of the acting (I'm not countin' Sandra Bullock here) is weak, the characterization is paper-thin, the writin' is laughable, the action sequences fail to generate any excitement, the plot devices are so unsurprisingly familiar, in fact, that they're very tired and poorly executed, and most importantly, placin' your sequel on a slow-moving cruise ship (and not somethin' quicker) is enough to guarantee that ""Speed 2"" is clearly dead on arrival. The comparatively lower stakes, don't help 'cause the hero has no reason to get involved  and most of the passengers are safely evacuated; only a few stay since we need tension. So yeah, in the hilariously one-sided battle in which ship-based film that 20th Century Studios released in 1997 was better, ""Titanic"" wins."

115,fish_called_wanda,critics,fresh,p,"The bright characterizations, vivid performances, and unexpectedly uproarious set-pieces have lost little of their luster over the ensuing decades."
116,fish_called_wanda,critics,fresh,p,It's almost as if each antihero is competing to be the most despicable of the lot.
117,fish_called_wanda,critics,fresh,p,"If anything, what Cleese and director Charles Crichton celebrate with A Fish Called Wanda is the art of the ensemble. Getting the pieces together is difficult, but when it works, it's a masterpiece."
118,fish_called_wanda,critics,fresh,p,There are certainly plenty of elements within A Fish Called Wanda that work exceedingly well...
119,fish_called_wanda,critics,fresh,p,"A nutty caper film that is sometimes riotous, sometimes romantic, and sometimes merely confused."
120,fish_called_wanda,critics,fresh,p,"To those who appreciate Ealing comedy (which is to say all right-thinking people), watching the film is like chancing on a Hogarth sketch in grandmother's attic, clearly and unmistakably signed by the Master."
121,fish_called_wanda,critics,fresh,p,"In the Monty Python tradition, the script is an assembly of skitlike situations cobbled into a flimsy story. The humor is cruel and at times wildly funny."
122,fish_called_wanda,critics,fresh,p,"The antics alone are fun to watch, but the dialogue is priceless, and there's never been such a hilarious blend of American and British humor."
123,fish_called_wanda,critics,fresh,p,The key to Wanda's comedy is the ever-shifting loyalties of its four nutty main characters.
124,fish_called_wanda,critics,fresh,p,"A Fish Called Wanda is vintage black comedy, British-style -- a cruel, dastardly, down-and-dirty jewel-robbery romp that pits thief against thief, while entangling an innocent bystander in the web of greed, romance and decidedly cockeyed high jinks."
125,fish_called_wanda,critics,fresh,p,"Cleese's cracking script gives it a solid foundation, but it's the supporting cast who make this movie wanda-ful."
126,fish_called_wanda,critics,fresh,p,"Putting heart and heat into a film that could have easily slid by on silliness, Cleese proves himself a master actor."
127,fish_called_wanda,critics,fresh,p,"Perhaps the most unusual aspect of what is surely the year's most original and daring comedy is that John Cleese is not the funniest performer in it. Believe it or not, that honor goes to none other than the usually somber Kevin Kline."
128,fish_called_wanda,critics,fresh,p,As in most of his Python parts... Cleese's character is an extended riff on the concept of pomposity. But Archie is more leavened with humanity than any of his other roles.
129,fish_called_wanda,critics,fresh,p,This hilarious tale of criminal incompetence and transatlantic eccentricity is easily John Cleese's finest achievement since Fawlty Towers.
130,fish_called_wanda,critics,rotten,n,"Somehow, the movie manages to do the impossible: It makes John Cleese less than hilarious."
131,fish_called_wanda,critics,fresh,p,"Low comedy at high speed, it pretends to be a caper movie about a smooth London jewel heist and its infinitely complex aftermath. Actually, it's a smart farce about ingrained cultural differences."
132,fish_called_wanda,critics,rotten,n,"There are a few hilarious moments, and a few more that are foolish and even disgusting."
133,fish_called_wanda,critics,fresh,p,"The movie's basic joke holds that the overbearing, unselfconscious Americans will do anything and say anything (and usually as loudly as possible), while the timorous British are nearly too polite to breathe."
134,fish_called_wanda,critics,fresh,p,A Fish Called Wanda is at its most electric when it pits Cleese and Kline against each other.
135,fish_called_wanda,audience,1.0,n,Unfortunately I disagree.  Really not that funny.  Sorry.
136,fish_called_wanda,audience,5.0,p,One of the best films ever made. The philosophical themes and character development  are brilliant.
137,fish_called_wanda,audience,4.5,p,"A great comedy movie, deserves the 95."
138,fish_called_wanda,audience,3.0,p,"The movie was created as a hybrid of 1940-1950's Ealing comedy and later Monty Python-type silliness. The combination didn't quite work as intended.

I went to see it in the theater because of all the praise the movie got, but when I saw it, it had some laughs but it was less funny than I had come to expect. The movie's main joke is about the culture clash between the loud, overaggressive Americans versus the over-mannered, comatose Britons, but the stereotypes are so exaggerated they are more irritating than funny.

The movie is somewhat redeemed by the scenes with Cleese and Curtis, but the other leads resort to overacting, which in itself is not very funny. As a crime drama, it's not particularly clever either. I was glad to see it once, but I wouldn't bother again."
139,fish_called_wanda,audience,4.0,p,A very good movie if you like fish!
140,fish_called_wanda,audience,5.0,p,A wild ride from start to finish. A lot of fun!
141,fish_called_wanda,audience,4.0,p,"A Fish Called Wanda serves up all of the wit and painfully funny humour that one would expect from a film written by John Cleese. Curtis, Kline, and Palin are all rather good, as well as Cleese himself. The story manages to be fun from beginning to end, but also possess a unique degree of urgency suspense through it all, despite a reasonably predictable ending. The film is simple, and this is its strength, allowing the actors and farces to reign free of shackles and provide all of the entertainment that one could ever want."
142,fish_called_wanda,audience,4.5,p,A smart and witty and absolutely hilarious comedy.
143,fish_called_wanda,audience,3.5,p,Essential comedy with great performances
144,fish_called_wanda,audience,5.0,p,"This is one of the best comedies of all time. Kevin Kline, John Cleese a Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Palin shine in this masterpiece of English cinema. The plot fits the character's choices and the jokes are hilarious. If you like the English Comedy this is a must watch."
145,big,critics,fresh,p,Full of exquisite moments that help the film become both continually hilarious and unforgettably unique.
146,big,critics,fresh,p,"Director Penny Marshall doesn't hammer any themes or satire into the film; she, quite shrewdly, keeps Big likeably small. The comedy is natural and unforced, in no small part because of Hanks' wonderfully slapstick performance."
147,big,critics,fresh,p,"Oh, this movie. It's not sad, but it makes me tear up every single time without fail. It's delightfully 80s and Tom Hanks is an adorable heartbreaker."
148,big,critics,fresh,p,"What makes this all work, of course, is Hanks himself, who brings remarkable authenticity and simplicity to the role. He makes being a kid seem as wonderful as it was, and as scary and as confusing too."
149,big,critics,fresh,p,"Hanks, as a stranger in a strange land, gives us equal portions of laughs and insights into the worlds of both adults and adolescents. Big also offers up a very funny satire of corporate ladder climbing."
150,big,critics,fresh,p,"The film succeeds largely because of the splendid performance of Tom Hanks -- who is irresistibly funny as ""big"" Josh."
151,big,critics,fresh,p,"Tom Hanks is marvellously child-like as Josh, all restless energy, innocence and real pleasure in the liberation that being grown-up allows him."
152,big,critics,fresh,p,"Big may well be a formula fantasy movie, but Penny Marshall's polished direction combined with Hanks's gauche charm make it the best of the spate of body-swap movies turned out by Hollywood in the late 1980s."
153,big,critics,fresh,p,"Joyously entertaining, escapist stuff."
154,big,critics,fresh,p,A disarmingly sweet movie.
155,big,critics,fresh,p,...an agreeable yet unremarkable piece of work.
156,big,critics,fresh,p,"A funny, bittersweet film that opens as a cautionary tale about growing up too fast, but deepens into a movie about the unplumbable gulf between childhood and adulthood."
157,big,critics,fresh,p,A delightful comedy-fantasy.
158,big,critics,fresh,p,"There's also one absolutely charming moment when Hanks and Loggia leap from key to key to tap out the melody and harmony to ""Heart and Soul"" on a giant piano in the F.A.O. Schwarz toy store."
159,big,critics,fresh,p,"Penny Marshall brings a logic to the premise that is sustained through most of the movie. And where the other movies snickered at the sexual possibilities in the idea, she faces up to them with both candor and taste."
160,big,critics,fresh,p,"An otherwise-hackneyed story of personality transmigration takes on new meaning -- accompanied by plenty of laughs -- all because of the film`s gregarious and clever star, Tom Hanks."
161,big,critics,fresh,p,"This setup isn't exactly what you'd call plausible, but the follow-through is consistent and clever."
162,big,critics,fresh,p,"Big, which has been directed by Penny Marshall with verve and impeccable judgment, drops a child's innocence into the corporate rat race as if it were a depth charge."
163,big,critics,fresh,p,"When Marshall brings Hanks and Perkins together, she discovers a grace and lightness in their relationship that transcends the pinched thematics of the script."
164,big,critics,fresh,p,Not a major movie but a pleasing one.
165,big,audience,4.0,p,Such a great script accompanied by a career-defining performance from Tom Hanks.
166,big,audience,4.5,p,"Big is obviously a film ment for all ages from it's premise to it's comedy, making it endlessly entertaining and enjoyable. The performances really bring the story to life and make every childlike movement believable to the point where i genuinely got emotional in a story about a little kid in Tom Hanks' body. The story is well paced and has a good series of montages to keep the plot going and advance the character development that the main kid goes for. At no point was i bored or not enjoying myself immensely. The beginning sets up the story well with a genuinely creepy funfair that left you on the edge of your seat, and as soon as the film gets going it's even better, with an actually likeable and believable love interest that they managed to pull off without making it seem creepy that he was dating a grown woman. The story from then on is simple but extremely effective, filled with childlike whimsy and fun. If i had one problem it's that it's a bit too simple but i really think they took the concept to the extent they could have done without making it too jam packed or without taking the emotion away. I also love the ending of this film, that makes use of the simplicity of the story and, at least to me, doesn't feel weird or forced. What a fun premise carried out in a family fun way."
167,big,audience,4.0,p,"I had never seen this film but I'm glad I have now.  Sweet, funny and generally well done.  A treat for families and adults!"
168,big,audience,4.0,p,"This movie is definitely worth your time. The plot is interesting and the acting is extraordinary. The movie brings a big change to a little boys life. When he comes across a machine at a fair he makes a wish to become big. The next day he is double his size and tribble his age. The adventures that await him are fascinating, to watch while the time passes by."
169,big,audience,3.5,p,6/10 movie but 7/10 because it was so god damm funny
170,big,audience,3.5,p,"You know, this film is a lot creepier than you remember. Because the love story is...you know...statutory rape and there's all the talks about the ending, which part of me wonders why doesn't she just use Zoltar, especially since Elizabeth Perkins knows about it by the end of the movie. Also, even though Big is built up as this epic '80s comedy...it wasn't as consistently funny as I was hoping for. Maybe some of the gags were too subtle for me, who knows? Nevertheless, this is still a memorable movie for Tom Hanks back during his days as a funny man with a terrific performance, convincingly portraying the role of a 12-year-old suddenly grown up into a 30-year-old man overnight, having good chemistry with Elizabeth Perkins (once you get past the fact that she accidentally became a pedophile, of course), boasting charming scenes (*cough* FAO Schwarz piano *cough*) and having a good message about not growing up too quickly (what does that Bible verse say again about childish things?), resulting a very well-executed ending (she might need therapy afterwards, though...I'd hate to imagine what a proper sequel to this movie would've been like). While I found Big to be a tad bit overrated, it still boasts enough of a charm and good balance between being fun and dramatic that this '80s flick from the sisters of Garry Marshall and Steven Spielberg is ultimately worth watching, especially as an early sign of Tom Hanks' gifts as an actor, even before he starred in Philadelphia."
171,big,audience,5.0,p,A true 80's classic! Must see
172,big,audience,5.0,p,Just watched it again. What a great movie. Tom Hanks is brilliant.

175,galaxy_quest,critics,fresh,p,"This is one of the finest comedy films, possibly ever. It's fantastically written, parodying fandom with much love and affection, and so well performed by a cast of total icons."
176,galaxy_quest,critics,fresh,p,Everyone has their own specific definition of comfort food. Dean Parisot's pitch-perfect send-up/embrace of Star Trek fandom sits near the top of my list.
177,galaxy_quest,critics,fresh,p,"With such an entertaining cast and premise, it's no wonder the film has found a cult status that ironically mirrors its own satirizing of fandom and waning stardom."
178,galaxy_quest,critics,fresh,p,"There is a lot to love about Galaxy Quest, from its hilarious comedy to its dynamic characters to its fascinating take on sci-fi fandom."
179,galaxy_quest,critics,fresh,p,Galaxy Quest is dumbfounded by the devotion of the obsessive fan. And yet it treats SF fanatics with so much exasperated affection and respect that no Trekker could take offense at the ribbing.
180,galaxy_quest,critics,fresh,p,What helps drive Galaxy Quest home is that this film really is a love letter to sci-fi fans.
181,galaxy_quest,critics,rotten,n,The idea behind Galaxy Quest is a terrific one -- it's just too bad the movie never quite fulfills its promise or its premise.
182,galaxy_quest,critics,fresh,p,"While Galaxy Quest starts off like any other parody, it morphs into a truly human story about people, their humanity, their fragility, and their insecurities."
183,galaxy_quest,critics,fresh,p,"It's a warm, appealing comedy filled with well-realized characters and jokes ranging from the wry to the slapstick-y."
184,galaxy_quest,critics,fresh,p,Galaxy Quest is instead an affectionate and warmhearted send-up that celebrates the convention/sci-fi subculture it perceptively parodies.
185,galaxy_quest,critics,fresh,p,A one-joke sci-fi comedy.
186,galaxy_quest,critics,fresh,p,"The film never really bloats or sags, and remains utterly pleasurable throughout its entire running time."

190,galaxy_quest,critics,fresh,p,Galaxy Quest works not just as a parody or a send-up of a type of film. It works as a basic space adventure as well.
191,galaxy_quest,critics,fresh,p,"Before Tropic Thunder, there came this clever and satisfying spoof of ""Star Trek"" and its enduing fan phenomenon."
192,galaxy_quest,critics,fresh,p,"Despite a premise that sounds far from promising, GALAXY QUEST turns out to be an amusing adventure that ofers both good comedy and reasonably exciting science fiction."
193,galaxy_quest,critics,fresh,p,"While gently spoofing the old Star Trek series and honoring it, Galaxy Quest creates and inhabits its own uniquely lovable universe."
194,galaxy_quest,critics,fresh,p,An enormously entertaining pop-culture ride.
195,galaxy_quest,audience,4.5,p,"Oh wow. What a fantastic satirical sc-fi action adventure comedy. Fantastic cast. Why did nobody tell me about this?!!  

""Never give up, never surrender."""
196,galaxy_quest,audience,4.5,p,"So what would happen if we mix Star Trek with other science fiction movies, we get Galaxy Quest. Galaxy Quest has everything: great cast, amazing characters, unique designs and cheesy dialogue. Sure, Galaxy Quest has similar element to any Star Trek movies and TV shows. At least, Galaxy Quest is unique in every step of the way. Overall, Galaxy Quest will blow your mind into space."
197,galaxy_quest,audience,5.0,p,"My entire family loved this movie and watched it over and over.  There are so many great one liners and all of the main characters were hilarious in their own right.  This movie is right behind Princess Bride for having the most quotable lines.  Good characters, good plot, and funny as heck."
198,galaxy_quest,audience,3.5,p,"Though known for deftly blending the ""love letter"" and ""pastiche"" tones together into something truly unique and satisfying, Dean Parisot's ""Galaxy Quest"" honestly shocked me most in the screenwriting department. This movie puts on a clinic in how to structure a cinematic narrative in nearly every paradigm you can think of -- the Hero's Journey, the Sequence Method, Blake Snyder, etc. Every beat, scene and arc is just so tightly and aerodynamically arranged that you truly feel as though no time is wasted. You also really get a well-developed sense of the filmmakers' feelings on the subjectivity of one's reality versus another's, the complicated relationships that performers can have with their roles and more. Way more than just a parodical look at the tropes within one of sci-fi's most beloved IP's."
199,galaxy_quest,audience,4.0,p,Special effects were great.  Fast moving and the humor/sarcasm was well played.
200,galaxy_quest,audience,4.0,p,One of the most fun movies ever made!
201,galaxy_quest,audience,5.0,p,This will go down in the booksd as one of the favourite cult classics.  I watch every year or so and it never gets old.

24,it_happened_one_night,audience,5.0,p,"This may be but a wish-fulfillment farce, but well-crafted all the same. It is never dull, and the story keeps you off-balance so the viewer never can really be sure how things will turn out.

A spoiled daughter of a very rich father, tiring of his gilded cage, finally runs off to elope with a daredevil aviator, who is in New York. The father hires a slew of detectives to locate her, but she manages to get on a bus with a reporter who has heard about her situation and wants a big story to boost his career. With that purpose, he helps the daughter on her way to New York, but plenty of things go wrong along the way. And to make matters worse, the father decides to allow the marriage to take place-but complications ensue from that.

Great character interaction and acting not only between the two leads, but between each of them as well as side characters make the story exciting, and the atmosphere of a dull, irritating bus ride and later running through the countryside is perfectly conveyed. Arguably one of the greatest of Frank Capra's movies."
25,it_happened_one_night,audience,4.0,p,"Reviewed 7.26.21  To see this movie for the first time is to have it hit you: all romantic comedies started here.  Sure, Buster Keaton & Charlie Chaplin brilliantly touched on the genre via silent films in the 1920's.  But it wasn't until Robert Risken put pen to paper that this now ubiquitous genre was created.  If not for the cringeworthy way men communicated with women 'way back when,' the flow of the dialogue could have been lifted from a modern rom-com. 
 
It'll seem quaint to today's moviegoer.  Just to think that Claudette Colbert demanded a 'leg stunt double' be called in for the classic hitchhiking scene, before quipping ""that's not my leg,"" and relenting.  The film was pre-code too, but nonetheless, the prudish surface of things pervades.  It's all the funnier for it.  

Add Clark Gable at his still youthful and quirky best, and there's charm to spare.  Without context, one might dismiss it as simple, even frivolous (as many still do today when critiquing the genre).  But alas, it was revolutionary, becoming the first film to win all five major Academy awards. 
 
Sure it has blemishes, the flow is broken at times by odd sing-alongs and quirky asides, but that's kind of the beauty of it.  Romantic comedies still aren't considered high art, so it's the perfect blueprint for the genre it created.  Alone in a vacuum, it's a 3 star movie.  But as it sinks in that you're watching a must-see piece of film history, and a true first, it's 4 stars all the way."
26,it_happened_one_night,audience,3.5,p,"This type of movie is not normally my cup of tea.  Watching it with no context, it is a rather dated lightweight rom com that managed to win best picture at the 1934 Oscars, though few of the best picture winners from the era have aged well.  My opinion of the film improved actually by watching the special features (the main reason I bother with DVDs anymore), particularly the commentary from Frank Capra Jr.  He tells a story of a picture that was not considered to be much of anything by its lead actress, who insisted she had to go on vacation in four weeks and the film simply had to be done in that timeframe.  The result of this hectic and frenetic shooting schedule was a film that FEELS frenetic in terms of its pacing, and it took someone pointing this out to me to see what an amazing, seat-of-your-pants thing it was that the film got made at all, let alone to the great acclaim it received from audiences and critics.  This certainly deepened my respect for if not my enjoyment of this film.  It's got some really funny sequences and is worth the watch!"
27,it_happened_one_night,audience,4.0,p,"This was an enjoyable watch and the movie was clearly well-crafted, made particularly obvious by how tons of rom-coms have drawn inspiration from it. I had actually never seen Clark Gable in a movie before and found myself surprised at how slight and skinny he seemed. Most of the comedy has withstood the passing of time, though like most rom-coms they don't lean into it heavily enough to make the movie as funny as it could've been. Until this movie I'd been very surprised that I liked all the Capra movies I'd seen as he was a conservative with values that aren't held by anyone but the villains in some of his movies; this one was the first I'd seen where Robert Riskin was the screenwriter and it made much more sense after that as Robert (a  big liberal) apparently wrote Frank's earliest successes and Frank repeated them later. Of particular note to me was how much better this movie was than the Best Picture winner from the year prior as that was one of my least-favorite movies of all time; this one being extremely good cements my opinion that Cavalcade just sucked and that it wasn't representative of this era of movies. Woohoo!"
28,it_happened_one_night,audience,5.0,p,"I felt like I was watching the mother of the films. This movie has been so influential to cinema is impossible to not like it.

I watched this in the cleaned up, colourised version, with expertly placed sound effects. It was as if David Lean had been at the helm (not least when the steam train crashes off the wooden bridge into the river below). Keaton is physically adept and almost entirely unfunny. The acting generally is surprisingly naturalistic."

It's his magnum opus, that proves his mastery of his craft on all levels from the focused story, to the magnetic performances and set pieces, to the glorious music and amazing direction from co-directors, (Keaton and Bruckman). This a timeless classic of a sprawling epic tale that elevates, innovates the medium. Whilst showing off the talent of an amazing artist."

56,1008166-general,audience,1.0,n,"Gah. This did not age well. Considering that the main character would have owned or would have been working towards owning a slave and that the leading woman's character probably did own slaves, this movie is just about as entertaining as a feel-good comedy about a Nazi fighting the English. 

It doesn't help that Buster Keaton is no Charlie Chaplin. While the action is fairly consistent, the comedy is not. It's a hint of slapstick thrown in every now and again, hardly something to guffaw at."
57,1008166-general,audience,4.0,p,"This is remarkably impressive work. Keaton's ability to visualize scenes of great complexity and realism and then get them to physically manifest before the camera while simultaneously acting and giving some of the most impressive physical performances ever must be appreciated by true fans of cinema; or art in general, really.
I wasn't sure how I would take this film at first. It can be a real stretch to relate to and really appreciate films from this long ago in a way comparable to how they were for their time and that generation. Yeah, a lot of the prat falls verge on the corny, or do cross that line. But then there's the startling ease with which Keaton moves about the train; pulling himself back onto it, jumping or falling off, walking along the edge as it barrels along. 
The scene of the train crashing into the river as the bridge collapses has to be among the most impressive effects/scenes of its time. 
I found this often funny, from the physical humor to the saluting scene at the very end. That scene's very specific type of visual humor has been copied and used to great effect by comedy acts, writers, directors actors from Chaplin to The Three Stooges to Allen in the 70's. 3.8 stars"
58,1008166-general,audience,5.0,p,The best silent comedy there is. I think it's Buster Keaton's finest film.
59,1008166-general,audience,5.0,p,"This is a joy to watch.  The trains give a wonderful sense of movement throughout the film and Keaton's grace, fluidity and timing as he transverses through the various sets is a marvel to behold and all the more impressive since he did all his stunts.  There's not much that I can add that hasn't been said before about this film.  It's a great example of his genius and talent."

80,jerk,audience,3.5,p,"""MORE CANS!""

A combination of classic buffoonery and the straight-played gags that would reach their apex with Leslie Nielsen and the ZAZ team, The Jerk may reach for some pretty easy pickings on the comedy front at times but is still surprisingly entertaining decades later. This breakout film for Steve Martin is crude but so clearly embraces its identity with note-perfect delivery from a lead that was fresh from the top of the stand-up world, who subsequently demonstrated a penchant for physical comedy to match his dialogue. 

Comedy has always been a tough genre to do well, but a true test of the quality of a comedy is longevity - The Jerk doesn't rely much on topical humor that would age quickly, instead delivery a fast-paced energy from a motivated lead with a few strong gags to keep the laughs coming years down the line. Perhaps some of the racial humor would seem somewhat insensitive coming from someone in the modern day, but it never seems deliberately disrespectful and could actually be regarded as some well-placed satire. Was surprised to actually find quite a few belly laughs that didn't need to be considered in some larger context of pop culture to be appreciated, and they come right through to the very end. (3.5/5)"
81,jerk,audience,3.0,p,"Charming in how dated and dumb it is, The Jerk has a few laughs for you still.

Carl Reiner's screwball comedy The Jerk (1979) is really just a bunch of idiotic gags and silly absurdist humor. I did have a smile on my face the entire time as it's generally enjoyable. But I only laughed out loud a few times. Carl Gottlieb, Steve Martin, and Michael Elias wrote The Jerk with some clever satire on the American Dream, poverty, industry, capitalism, and entertainment in general. 

There's a genuinely sweet romance with Bernadette Peters stealing the show with her powerful and beautiful singing voice. Her high pitched, softer voice is so cute and she looks lovely. I think Steve Martin had funny chemistry with Peters, but his moronic character Navin wears on you after a while. He has brilliant moments of idiocy or deadpan humor, but it can be too stupid at times. I found Martin funnier in The Muppet Movie and Little Shop of Horrors.

Catlin Adams is a riot as the tough carnival biker chick Patty. Mabel King is great as Navin's sweet black Mother and Richard Ward's sincere Father is fantastic. Dick Anthony Williams got several laughs out of me as Taj, while Carl Gottlieb's cameo as Iron Balls McGinty is perfect. M. Emmet Walsh is hilarious as the crazed Madman gunman trying to shoot Steve Martin. Jackie Mason's cameo as gas station owner Harry Hartounian is the start of the hilarity really. Bill Macy's role as the investor Stan Fox is pretty great alongside Martin's comedy. Rob Reiner even cameos as the first truck driver.

The Jerk is mostly just silly cameos like Carl Reiner himself's funny cameo and misunderstandings with Steve Martin taking things literally. Carl Reiner's direction is pleasant, but editors Bud Molin and Ron Spang make this 94 minute movie feel like it's over 2 hours with a rather slow pace. Each joke is left there with too much space before the next gag in my opinion. It just makes The Jerk feel a bit slow. Victor J. Kemper pulls off some funny visual gags with his wide shot cinematography and perspective humor that still works.

Jack Elliott's score is pretty fun with a variety of musical styles. I seriously love the duet Bernadette Peters and Steve Martin sing on the beach. It's shockingly beautiful and out of nowhere. Theadora Van Runkle must have had fun designing costumes for The Jerk as everyone looks awful and hilarious.

In short, The Jerk is still funny at times, but not every joke has aged well."

86,jerk,audience,3.5,p,"Don't be mistaken - The Jerk is a Carl Reiner film filled with Carl Reiner humor, but this is a Steve Martin showcase from beginning to end.  Martin plays an imbecile named Navin, a white man from a black family is Mississippi who, upon realizing that he is in fact white, embarks on a journey to discover himself.  Some of the jokes are brilliant while others fall flat on their face, but Martin is brilliant from beginning to end.  From his excitement to see his name in the phone book (""I'm a somebody now!!) to the ""that's all I need"" scene at the end, Martin plays every scene as only Martin can.  Sure, it's dumb and predictable and more than a little silly at times, but it just feels good to watch it."

I say that because the combination of Jackie Chan-style martial arts comedies with Looney Tunes works because of their similar influences. Legend of Drunken Master and Looney Tunes were both heavily inspired by the physicality of vaudeville, commedia dell'arte, and slapstick and thus were similar enough in style to be a ""peanut butter and chocolate"" combination.

128,elf,critics,fresh,p,"Ferrell is a hoot. So is much of this witty holiday family entertainment, which, up until the end, when the ""true spirit of Christmas"" must be reaffirmed, happily favors slapstick over treacle."
129,elf,critics,fresh,p,"Raise a glass of cheer to Ferrell and Favreau. They might not have created a full-scale holiday classic here, but they've certainly given us a fresh, sparkly new bauble to hang on our perennial tree."
130,elf,critics,fresh,p,"Will Ferrell has the ability to turn those wide eyes and that big body into a potent comic weapon, so Elf gets a good number of laughs from his complete, innocent abandonment to his role as a lummox-size elf."
131,elf,critics,fresh,p,"It was all very simple, but enough to remind me just what a generous and talented performer Will Ferrell truly is."
132,elf,critics,fresh,p,Elf is a Christmas comedy that's as sweet-natured and goofily amusing as its title character.

134,elf,critics,fresh,p,"All told, Elf is undeniably cute, but not destined to become a Christmas classic. Nevertheless, children will love it."
135,elf,critics,fresh,p,"A gleeful, cracked fairytale."
136,elf,critics,fresh,p,"Dressed in a snug green outfit throughout and dispensing decorations, sugary snacks and a beaming grin, Ferrell is the life and soul of an otherwise unexceptional Christmas celebration."
137,elf,critics,rotten,n,"It would be Scrooge-like to say mean things about the innocuous Elf, so I'll just point out that director Jon Favreau's film rarely reaches its full comic potential."
138,elf,critics,fresh,p,"Sure, Elf feels a little too feel-good at the end, but what do you expect? It's a Christmas movie! Anything else would be the cinematic equivalent of finding coal in your stocking."
139,elf,critics,rotten,n,"The cast wrings laughs out of David Berenbaum's script as if it were a damp washcloth, but even they have trouble selling frenetic button-pushing as the Christmas spirit."
140,elf,audience,4.0,p,"Despite being over-played, it is a hilarious film with Ferrell bringing us one of his most memorable performances. It's entertaining from beginning, and truly a classic!"
141,elf,audience,4.5,p,"Over the years, this has become my favorite holiday movie. The humor of Will Ferrell and the charm of Zoey are the perfect pairing. I watch this movie every year."
142,elf,audience,4.0,p,"Christmas Classic, baby. Will Ferrell is hilarious, and Zooey is lovely."
143,elf,audience,5.0,p,Elf (2003) Is my favorite Christmas movie it’s just so funny and Will Ferrel is an great actor. The movie is super funny & filled with pratfalls. Awesome movie for kids like me. 5/5 | 10/10. In My Opinion
144,elf,audience,4.5,p,Bye Buddy! Another fantastic example of a modern Christmas classic!
145,elf,audience,5.0,p,It's awesome and sweet
146,elf,audience,5.0,p,A heartwarming Christmas classic that the whole family can enjoy every year. Will Ferell is excellent and brings the Christmas cheer into your living room.
147,elf,audience,4.5,p,"A wonderful, jolly, hilarious, and visually impressive Christmas movie that everyone can enjoy. Elf is a great film with great acting from Will Ferrell who plays a naivety character, Zooey Deschanel who plays a wonderful part in the film with great chemistry, and Bob Newhart who is known for his deadpan and slightly stammering delivery style is what made the film so great! Everything about Elf is excellent!"
148,elf,audience,1.0,n,Incredibly stupid and Will Farrell's overacting was especially annoying. My 8 year old son became incredibly bored with this mundane plot and quit watching a half hour into this borefest. Not one funny scene in the entire movie.

154,legally_blonde,critics,fresh,p,"A cut (and style) above other comedies of this ilk, Legally Blonde mainly succeeds because of Witherspoon's winning performance."
155,legally_blonde,critics,fresh,p,"Reese Witherspoon is the single-best thing about Legally Blonde, a comedy that has no business being as fun and entertaining as it is."
156,legally_blonde,critics,fresh,p,"The movie is a lot like 1995's Clueless, which was also totally cute, in that it has a brain and a heart. And like its heroine, it's a lot smarter than it looks."

170,legally_blonde,audience,3.5,p,It made me cringe often but just as much I was laughing or just satisfied with the story development. Also I just like Selma Blair in this movie.
171,legally_blonde,audience,3.5,p,"This may not be My Cousin Vinny but it isn't that far off.  Reese Witherspoon broke through with this film.  She makes Elle believable as a California girl with spirit and brains she didn't even realize she had.  The art direction goes along with Witherspoon to keep things bubbly even when the script fails to live up to the star.  Luke Wilson and Holland Taylor have some nice funny and it was fun to see Raquel Welch in a cameo.  

As was aforementioned, the material is predictable.  This is a very good empowerment movie for teenage girls.  The message is to believe in yourself and follow your dreams."
172,legally_blonde,audience,5.0,p,It's the best representative of feminism and revolution in the industry
173,legally_blonde,audience,4.0,p,"Legally Blonde is one of those American comedies that are utterly unrealistic and predictable in their story, but that silliness mattered little when the movie was this entertaining and funny. Reese Witherspoon absolutely killed it as the instantly iconic Elle Woods, a hilarious ditzy blonde who somehow ends up finishing Harvard Law School. The second half lost some of the first half's energy, but for the most part the movie is highly enjoyable and very endearing."

181,the_big_lebowski,critics,fresh,p,...at once the most fun and the least fun of the Coen brothers' films.
182,the_big_lebowski,critics,fresh,p,I do like the clever story telling. It keeps you guessing throughout. The script is tightly structured and there are some very memorable lines.
183,the_big_lebowski,critics,fresh,p,"What a great, silly movie."
184,the_big_lebowski,critics,fresh,p,The dude abides. Jeff Bridges and John Goodman standout in the stoner comedy film to rule them all. [Full review in Spanish]
185,the_big_lebowski,critics,fresh,p,"The dialogue is riddled with moody, witty cursing and unequalled wordplay - and all sorts of sarcastic nonsense."
186,the_big_lebowski,critics,fresh,p,"A frantic mish-mash of comedy, mystery, and cinematic trickery that, while it can be overwhelming at first glance, is one of the most unique and entertaining films in a generation."
187,the_big_lebowski,critics,fresh,p,"I could tell you how much I love this movie but that's just, like, my opinion, man."
188,the_big_lebowski,critics,fresh,p,If The Dude is the representative figure of early 1990s America - a lazy white guy constantly breaking the law with impunity - it's no wonder his story remains relevant even now that the film is old enough to order its own White Russian.
189,the_big_lebowski,critics,fresh,p,"The comedy largely centers itself on Bridges, whose blissfully nonplussed reaction shots always provide a grounding effect for the rest of the movie."
190,the_big_lebowski,critics,fresh,p,"For those of you who forgot how good Bridges was in The Fisher King, here is a reminder. As the gung-ho Nam veteran, Goodman's tenacious, tightly coiled demeanor is smartly explosive and very funny."
191,the_big_lebowski,critics,rotten,n,"What made Fargo work, aside from the regional kitsch, was a solid story and believable characters worth caring about. The Big Lebowski has neither."
192,the_big_lebowski,critics,fresh,p,"The Big Lebowski (1998) is a dark, idiosyncratic and quirky comedy/crime caper-thriller involving an intriguing complex case of mistaken identity, deception, double-crosses, and a mysterious kidnapping. It came from the inventive, cultish..."
193,the_big_lebowski,critics,fresh,p,"""The Big Lebowski"" is easy to love and rewarding to obsess over, but for me, it's more than just a fun movie to quote; it's a comforting memory generator, and when I watch it, if I squint, I can kind of see my dad again."
194,the_big_lebowski,critics,fresh,p,"Already a pessimistic take on the American Dream and the ideal of the self-made man, the model of the film-noir detective is ridiculed in The Big Lebowski."
195,the_big_lebowski,critics,fresh,p,Lebowski's virtuosity serves a sense of modesty.
196,the_big_lebowski,critics,fresh,p,One of a kind.
197,the_big_lebowski,critics,fresh,p,"If one were to examine the entire cinematic resume of the Coen Brothers, The Big Lebowskiwould assuredly rest within the top five spots."
198,the_big_lebowski,critics,fresh,p,I'll just say this: The Big Lebowksi is an excellent movie - and damn funny.
199,the_big_lebowski,critics,fresh,p,"A return to form... where large men scream very loudly and jokes are pounded into the ground with vigor and brio. Goodman's Walter is a bullet-headed, barely contained titan of rage, running on the fumes of cracked beliefs and fierce garble-gabble."
200,the_big_lebowski,audience,5.0,p,"Fantastic film. I can see why there is a cult following and I'm on board. The ""Dude"" is one of the best characters I've ever encountered. I can't think of many more characters I would want to just chill with than the Dude and be in his crazy world for a little bit. Not to mention, some of the scenes are pee your pants funny. For me, this was one of those films I am angry wasn't alot longer. Loved every second. Ton of fun"
201,the_big_lebowski,audience,4.0,p,I got to say while I enjoy the Dude I love Walter so much more.
202,the_big_lebowski,audience,5.0,p,"Quite simply one of the best feel good buddy films ever.  Hardly a scene goes by without belly laughs not to mention deliciously quotable dialogue.

The ensemble cast are absolutely perfect and make the characters their own.

The dude abides!"
203,the_big_lebowski,audience,5.0,p,"A comedy of errors and bizarre characters, California is clearly rubbing off on the Coens here."
204,the_big_lebowski,audience,4.0,p,"Surrealistic film noir - but instead of Humphrey Bogart, there's Jeff Bridges. All that's missing is Julianne Moore coming down the stairs and saying, ""I'm ready for my close up, Mister DeMille"". The funny thing is that Bridges has done many excellent, memorable films, but when people recognize him at a restaurant,  I'll put odds that they'll say, ""The Dude abides!"""
205,the_big_lebowski,audience,4.0,p,"As crazy as it can get, ‘The big Lebowski' delivers an exquisite comedy with lots of laughs and sort of an interesting plot."
206,the_big_lebowski,audience,3.5,p,"Sweet, colorful movie."
207,the_big_lebowski,audience,4.0,p,"So funny, perfectly lighthearted as a movie for the weekend."
208,the_big_lebowski,audience,4.5,p,An unexpectedly enjoyable farce! :)
209,the_big_lebowski,audience,3.5,p,"Loved this movie when it as released.  Now?  Not at all funny the second time around.  The jokes have been worn out.  Still the acting is fun to watch.  It doesn't stand out as a classic among classics which would be 5 stars so I think 3.5 is fair for this return visit but, if you are watching it for the first time it's pretty much a 5."
0,duck_soup,critics,rotten,n,I found it tedious and not very funny. The fact that it was short was a relief but I don't think I will seek out any more films by the Marx Brothers.
1,duck_soup,critics,fresh,p,"One incidental sequence of slapstick in which Harpo smashes a mirror and then appears opposite Groucho as his reflection, is the funniest thing in any Marx film since The Cocoanuts."
2,duck_soup,critics,fresh,p,"Babbling absurdity is the main ingredient and chaos is the result, with random jokes, skits, and sketches composing the bulk of the story."
3,duck_soup,critics,fresh,p,"The Marx Brothers in one of their slighter divertissements. Funny and wild, but not wildly funny."
4,duck_soup,critics,rotten,n,"Obviously desperate for material, the Four Marx Brothers tried everything from musical comedy sequences to a I-et 'Em Eat Cake burlesque revolution. An uneven production but some of the sketches are worth the money."
5,duck_soup,critics,fresh,p,One of the great comedies without question.
6,duck_soup,critics,fresh,p,True movie fans haven't lived until they've caught its nonstop barrage of classic bits.
7,duck_soup,critics,fresh,p,"For all its wild comic abandon, Duck Soup has darker implications than the usual Marx Brothers comedy and, as such, feels the most relevant and sharp in its satire. [Blu-ray]"
8,duck_soup,critics,fresh,p,"It turns out that the sharp-tongued humour of Groucho Marx is ageless, the slapstick timely and the subject matter still pertinent: loony dictatorship, religion, pointless warfare."
9,duck_soup,critics,fresh,p,The funniest of the Marx Brothers pictures ...
10,duck_soup,critics,fresh,p,The sheer silliness is inspired ...
11,duck_soup,critics,fresh,p,Questioning the canonical standing of a titan such as Duck Soup seems like an exercise in questioning the tastes of those who like it rather than the upbraiding the comedy mechanics of the film itself.
12,duck_soup,critics,fresh,p,A comedy classic that boasts some of Groucho's prickliest zingers and the pinnacle of Harpo's mirthful mischief.
13,duck_soup,critics,fresh,p,Genius just about covers it.
14,duck_soup,critics,rotten,n,...a glaring example of the element of the Marx Brothers' comedy that's always bothered me: the reliance on insults and cruelty.
15,duck_soup,critics,fresh,p,One of the funniest movies of the Marx brothers--and of the Depression era.
16,duck_soup,critics,fresh,p,Nonstop classic Marx Bros. mayhem kids will love.
17,duck_soup,critics,fresh,p,"Watch for the famous ""mirror scene"" in which Harpo--dressed as Groucho--matches Groucho's every movement in a non-existent mirror--pure comic genius."
18,duck_soup,critics,fresh,p,"Melhor longa da carreira dos irmos Marx, o filme  uma verdadeira metralhadora giratria, disparando dilogos precisamente construdos e gags fsicas inesquecveis com uma rapidez invejvel ainda nos dias de hoje."
19,duck_soup,critics,fresh,p,Comic anarchy at its very best. This one just keeps getting better.
20,duck_soup,audience,4.5,p,"Probably the Marx Brothers' most famous comedy, ""Duck Soup"" is a hilarious and wacky slapstick comedy that even manages to take a stab at politics. Groucho plays Rufus Firefly, who is appointed the new president of Freedonia. He has a dubious stance on work ethic and attempts to cut work hours by reducing the length of employee lunch breaks.

Mrs. Teasdale, who has donated twenty million dollars to the failing country, becomes the object of affection for Rufus, who has to battle for her hand against Ambassador Trentino of the neighboring country Sylvania. Soon their tumult escalates and war is declared between the two countries.

Most people who comment on this film seem to indicate that they saw it at a very young age and have grown up with it. I can honestly say I wasn't given the opportunity to ever see it until recently, when I finally managed to watch it on Turner Classic Movies, completely uninterrupted.

Although it is not consistently laugh-out-loud, tears-in-your-eyes hilarious, ""Duck Soup"" is very funny - and not quite as outrageous as I had expected. There's a lot going on here, aside from silly physical humor.

The Marx Brothers are great as usual and as usual Groucho steals the show.

Ultimately if you've never seen this, you need to go rent it out right now. If you have seen it, you already know how great it is and why it deserves its reputation as one of the most beloved comedies ever made."
21,duck_soup,audience,5.0,p,"This is not only the Marx Brothers' best film, it is also the greatest political satire of all time.  Groucho plays the leader of Freedonia.  Harpo and Chico play his spies.  It includes one of the more imitated scenes of all time---the mirror scene with Grouch and Harpo which Harpo recreated with Lucille Ball years later."
22,duck_soup,audience,4.0,p,"I don't like Duck Soup as much as A Night at the Opera (my fave Marx film), even though this one is the more unhinged and anarchic.  The visual comedy here is particularly good (see the mirror sequence for example).  A lot of joyful silliness at the expense of the pomp and circumstance of public (and military) life on display here."
23,duck_soup,audience,5.0,p,"Simply one of the greatest comedy films ever made, and the best of the brothers' Paramount period...more irreverent and nutty than ""Night at the Opera"", the best of their MGM films"
24,duck_soup,audience,5.0,p,"Different level ....even now they were that far ahead of their time , as funny as you will find on a roll of film, absolutely superb comedic geniuses . Ive seen their films countless times and never miss them when they are on the telly."
25,duck_soup,audience,3.5,p,Funny considering the time but rather dated.  Worth a watch or two but generally over rated.
26,duck_soup,audience,2.5,n,"Duck Soup is an appropriate appetizer for anyone who is interested in delving into the comedy of the Marx Brothers.  The plot, which is really a secondary issue when it comes to any movie with the Marx Brothers, involves Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho) taking over the presidency of Freedonia and the inevitable mayhem that ensues.  Really…that's about it.  The humor is based primarily on puns and slapstick, the former provided by an inspired Groucho and the latter provided by Harpo and Chico.  The humor is truly a mixed bag and there is generally about one laugh for every ten misfires, but they come fast and furious.  The antics of Harpo and Chico get a bit tiresome, but it is all part of the package when it comes to the Marx Brothers."
27,duck_soup,audience,4.0,p,"Chaplin's prevalence in the silent era has likely led to his particular brand of comedy becoming more universal and longer-lasting, but the Marx Brothers were the champions of comedy in the '30s, and much of their output still feels funny today, especially the visual bits. Groucho's delivery seems dated in spots for sure, but the film is still among the best of the decade, and a landmark of early comedy in sound. In many ways, the antiquated vernacular is part of the charm. Zeppo sticks out like a sore thumb compared to his brothers, though. (4/5)"
28,duck_soup,audience,3.0,p,It's still a blast and really funny.
29,duck_soup,audience,0.5,n,"This comedy does not age well at all. Not even worthy of a smirk. Annoying songs, annoyingly bad one liners, annoying slapstick. The whole thing is dross. Laurel and Hardy were and still are exceptional. This is the first and last Marx Brothers film I've watched. Awful."
30,theres_something_about_mary,critics,fresh,p,"Blends ludicrous fantasy, uncomfortable reality, and cartoonish slapstick, which magically straightens out the mess of combating characters - all with romance and sincerity."
31,theres_something_about_mary,critics,fresh,p,Farrelly bros' classic is full of gross-out laughs.
32,theres_something_about_mary,critics,fresh,p,"The movie managed to walk a line between raunchy, gross-out comedy and a romantic comedy."
33,theres_something_about_mary,critics,fresh,p,"Gauche, garish, and gross, a prime example of the coarsening of our culture and of the art of comedy in film. It's also pretty darn funny. [Blu-ray]"
34,theres_something_about_mary,critics,fresh,p,If the sight of a large chunk of a man's private parts caught in the teeth of a zipper is funny -- and I'm not saying it isn't -- then have I got a movie for you.
35,theres_something_about_mary,critics,fresh,p,"This one is dumbest. And funniest, as if that matters even a little bit!"
36,theres_something_about_mary,critics,fresh,p,"Losers competing against one another (and even bigger losers) for a dishy woman: That's the setup for [the Farrellys'] wrackingly funny new farce There's Something About Mary, maybe the ultimate nerd masochistic fantasy."
37,theres_something_about_mary,critics,fresh,p,"Crudely made, somewhat overlong and larded with plenty of things that don't work, pic stands as proof positive that a comedy can be far from perfect and still hit the bull's-eye if it delivers when it counts in its big scenes."
38,theres_something_about_mary,critics,fresh,p,"Despite my earlier reservations about Bobby and Peter Farrelly, they're progressively winning me over, partly because they keep getting better."
39,theres_something_about_mary,critics,fresh,p,A romantic gross-out comedy: What a concept!
40,theres_something_about_mary,critics,fresh,p,"Puerile, politically incorrect, rib-achingly funny and strangely insightful."
41,theres_something_about_mary,critics,fresh,p,"...Dillon's Pat, in an effort to win Mary's affections, poorly attempts to ape her compassion for the handicapped by referring to them as ""retards"" and ""goofy bastards..."
42,theres_something_about_mary,critics,fresh,p,"Remarkable for all the sick and politically incorrect sight gags it gets away with in its rule-breaking romp through the supposedly sacred laws of what makes people laugh, and what doesn't."
43,theres_something_about_mary,critics,fresh,p,"It was the raunchy comedy that raked in the headlines and had audiences shaking their heads in offended laughter, then coming back the weekend after, dragging in friends by their arms."
44,theres_something_about_mary,critics,fresh,p,"Crude, offensive, sexist -- and embarrassingly hilarious."
45,theres_something_about_mary,critics,fresh,p,Everyone falls for Mary -- why wouldn't they? -- and no one is spared from the Farrellys' razor sharp raunch.
46,theres_something_about_mary,critics,fresh,p,"One of the weirdest romantic comedies around, combining scatalogical and no-taste humor with naivete and sweetness."
47,theres_something_about_mary,critics,rotten,n,...there were also moments when I was actually bored.
48,theres_something_about_mary,critics,fresh,p,"Two very entertaining hours -- something that Hollywood comedies these days fail to deliver to the audience, with or without references to certain bodily fluids."
49,theres_something_about_mary,critics,fresh,p,Gross-out laughs with heart.
50,theres_something_about_mary,audience,4.0,p,"It's dumb, and offensive, and juvenile as all get out, but it somehow manages to be really funny."
51,theres_something_about_mary,audience,3.5,p,"The first scene had me worried that this was gonna be no better than all the other lowbrow Farrelly movies. It really did improve after that though, with a mildly believable plot and an excellent blend of jokes. They had a few that were setup near the beginning of the movie that paid off at the end to make a super-entertaining ending, some witty banter thanks to buying jokes from Seinfeld, the situational humor as it related to the plot and then the more obvious Farrelly fare. From a filmmaking perspective I thought they'd done an exceptionally poor job making the leads look like high schoolers for the flashback scene and I wish they'd found more for that musical narrator to do as he was definitely a highlight."
52,theres_something_about_mary,audience,4.5,p,"Only the Farrelly brothers could make a movie about unrequited love as laugh-out-loud funny as There's Something About Mary.  Thirteen years after a disastrous prom incident, Ted (Ben Stiller) is still in love with Mary (Cameron Diaz) despite the fact that he hasn't seen her since his genitals got caught in his zipper on that fateful day.  The chain of events that lead to the heart-warming conclusion are improbable, outlandish, gross and, most importantly, hilarious.  What makes many of the iconic scenes so perfect is the general tone of sweetness that is promptly shattered by comic horror.  The characters are all insanely likable, the story is surprisingly complex (for this sort of film) with plenty of surprises and the cast is consistently solid from top to bottom."

55,theres_something_about_mary,audience,4.5,p,There really is something about Mary. This is my favorite comedy ever! This movie is so special because it does stuff that other comedies don't! Two scenes specific. The acting is honestly very good. Lee Evans played great at having disability and W. Earl Brown was amazing with his disability as well. The ending is also exactly what you want to happen too!

80,1011818-ladykillers,audience,5.0,p,"Hysterically sinister and pleasantly chilling.

Alexander Mackendrick's British crime black comedy The Ladykillers (1955) is the most proper English spoof on a crime caper you can imagine. Mackendrick's wiley direction is delightful in how focused he is on propelling the plot and establishing how all the crime antics must unfold. I was smiling the entire time watching The Ladykillers. It's a true classic comedy and parodies every mistake a crime drama could conjure. Mackendrick's fantastic direction is so playful and quaint that The Ladykillers is easily a comfortable movie watch for me.

William Rose's legendary script has a joke in every line and feels so very British. His send up of English morals and beliefs through his too good elderly lady Mrs. Wilberforce is hilarious. Katie Johnson's performance is perfectly ignorant of what's really going on as she focuses on her neighborhood watching, parrot feeding, and police reporting all while offering tea is the most sincere British mannerisms you could fathom. Her loud parrots are cute with their dancing to the music and reacting to the scene. Each villain character is funny in how vile and soulless they all seem with their lack of ethics or morals, while also portraying a type of man who would take offense in being made to off an old lady.

Alec Guinness is wickedly entertaining as the cunning criminal mastermind Professor Marcus, who plans a cash truck robbery at an old lady's home. Alex Garfath's make-up for Guinness is fabulous as he looks pale, gaunt, disheveled, and still fancy as the crazy Professor Marcus. Cecil Parker is fun as the nervous Major Courtenay with his excuses and paranoid misgivings. 

A young, handsome Herbert Lom plays the trigger happy Louis with his quick temper and lethal leanings. An equally youthful Peter Sellers is excellent as the panicky rebel youth Harry. Danny Green looks massive as One-Round with his insecurity over his dull wits and sincere attachment to Mrs. Wilberforce. Each of the leads is perfectly cast and plays their specific part with a whimsy and understanding of their unique role. I also liked the silly stuffy British attitude of Jack Warner's Superintendent and Philip Stainton's Sergeant.

Jack Harris' editing feels so smooth, natural, and brisk that The Ladykillers' 91 minute run-time feels like 30. Otto Heller's cinematography playfully shows you the entire room and house, so you always know exactly where everyone is during this caper. Tristram Cary's score is neat with a whimsical fancy and a curious evil to his music. I liked all the classical music in it too from the records. Anthony Mendleson's costumes are super creepy and unnerving for the criminals with shady backgrounds and cozy for the other British people. Norman Dorme, Jack Shampan, and Tony Rimmington's set decoration is cute with antiques everywhere in Mrs. Wilberforce's home.

In all, The Ladykillers will have you screaming with delight!"
81,1011818-ladykillers,audience,4.5,p,Like so many English comedies of this era it is delightfully offbeat and filled with gallows humor.  Guinness' choice to do the movie mimicking Alister Sim was an inspired choice.
82,1011818-ladykillers,audience,4.0,p,a sequence of slapstick accidents tired in a grim intrigue
83,1011818-ladykillers,audience,3.5,p,"Don't make the same mistake I did by watching the Coen Brothers' 2004 remake first; the Ealing Studios original is far more nuanced, but much of the enjoyment is ruined if you are constantly reminded of its over-the-top counterpart and what parallels may be drawn between them. In true classic British comedy fashion, the overt jokes are relatively few and far between, choosing instead to lampoon through tinier moments. Guinness really demonstrates his superb range here, with a character that seems to exude grease like carbon dioxide, and Sellers gives a relatively uncharacteristic (yet capable) performance that doesn't necessarily take advantage of his strengths in terms of physical comedy. It may not be entirely to modern tastes, but remains a classic. (3.5/5)"

86,1011818-ladykillers,audience,4.5,p,"""So how much real harm have we done anybody?  One farthing's worth, Mrs. Wilberforce.  You hadn't thought of it like that, had you?""

*in the next room*

""Hey, you know what, I never thought it like that either.""

5 thieves move into an old lady's house and use it as a staging ground for an armored car heist.  After the heist the old lady finds out what they're up to and is a good kind person so tells them she's going to report them to the police... so... they need to kill her.

I thought this movie was terrific.

Couple firsts here for me.

This is the first Ealing studios British comedy I've seen as well as the first time I've seen Alec Guinness in the kind of role he was originally famous for, these comedic roles rather than epics like Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia or  ya know.... Star Wars.

Alec Guinness as this almost inhuman monster of a man, he's totally unrecognizable with the bad hair and teeth.  And it's a great performance!  He's excellent as this gentlemanly master thief like in the scenes where he's trying to explain to the old lady why they ""can't"" give the money back and he's just making all this horseshit up but he's trying to talk on her level.

The whole cast is great.

Peter Sellers is one of my favorite actors of all time and here he plays a London thief and like always he's fantastic.  This great bit where he's playing with a gun flipping it around miming how he's gonna blow the old lady away and nobody is better at physical humor than Peter Sellers, that's just a fact.

1955 British comedy and it's STILL funny, which is nice.  Not just the dialog but moments like the lady takes the money and locks it away in a room... and the second she leaves, One Round the gang's muscle breaks the door open with one hand

And it's a great crime movie, as well.  Like the thrill of wondering if the thieves are gonna get away with it like a moment where the trunk full of money is left alone hanging out of a taxi cab and our guys have to sit there and watch.  And throughout the final act it's all about this battle of who kills the old lady and who gets the money.

This movie was of course remade by the Coen Brothers in 2004 and that's a personal favorite of mine despite most people not liking it.  Goddamn there's a lot of funny in that movie.  I prefer it actually, for one thing the old lady is much more entertaining in the remake.  I tend to think when it comes to remakes it's really whichever version you see first tends to be the one you prefer anyway.  So I prefer the Coen Brothers version but this is a superb crime comedy nonetheless."

113,when_harry_met_sally,audience,3.5,p,"I remember a montage that the Loews theater chain I frequented as a child played before all their showings that showcased memorable movie moments and famous lines from other films. This montage heavily featured a woman yelling ""Yes!"" in a diner, followed by the famous punchline by the woman at the next table and I'd always notice this line got the most chuckles, without fail, each and every time. Sometimes gaining context may take awhile but it never fails to disappoint when the moment occurs.

I definitely enjoyed this film where the dialogue shines and found Meg Ryan to be an absolute delight. There is not much meat to this plot which is also quite unoriginal and predictable at its core but can act as a further credit to the performances, presentation, and script which makes this story stand out among so many others like it. 7.5/10

I don't blame Rob Reiner for this one, as writer Nora Ephron is not someone we want to turn to for romantic ideals. She was a newswoman formerly on the murder beat, then moved into tearing apart her broken relationships onscreen trying to make them sound...Loving? Emotionally evolved? No. These are not real adult humans having conversations that mimic life. Even Jerry Seinfeld could have a better bowel movement than the dialogues provided within this frame. 

I do admire Ephron as a business woman, but not as an innovator in understanding the destructive psychosis that dogged her films. This film is pretty abhorrent in that regard, although seemingly beloved?

Ben Stiller gives one of his best performances to date, with Robert De Niro also churning out an excellent stereotype of overstepping fathers-in-law. It's oversimplified and a bit unbelievable, sure - I mean, there's no way this many disasters could all happen over the course of a single weekend. There are also a few ""why didn't they just...?"" moments throughout, but it doesn't really matter because the film is great at suspending that disbelief and making audiences cover their faces in second-hand embarrassment.

147,meet_the_parents,audience,0.5,n,"Of all comedy films I have seen, I cannot recall any that caused me such legitimate rage and borderline pain as this one.  It's mean-spirited, unpleasant, awkward and is as low-brow as possible without resorting to a series of fart jokes.  Robert De Niro's character might be the single most thoroughly hateable character in all of cinema, but this movie thinks we somehow care about this monster of a human being and hope he just comes to an understanding with Ben Stiller's character.  The movie also features numerous segments that appear to completely devoid of jokes..or at least that's how they appeared to me; friends would later quote those bits as being funny, marking this the first comedy in history where the jokes were so taxing to endure that I literally didn't even know they were supposed to be jokes in the first place.  I've seen several comedies where I don't ever laugh throughout them, but at least in those cases I can tell where I'm SUPPOSED TO be laughing, but not here -- it just involves Robert De Niro yelling angrily and then the scene is over, and somehow that's supposed to be funny.  I speak no hyperbole that I saw this on a bus and I seriously contemplated having the driver simply drop me off in the middle of nowhere just so I didn't have to keep watching this insufferable, aggressive and unrelenting excuse for a movie.  This is, purely and simply, the Nadir of cinematic comedy."

172,1086991-life,audience,5.0,p,"This movie float between drama and comedy but it does have many subtle messages.

Eddie Murphy and Lawrence Martin shared a jolly good buddy comedy and onscreen chemistry.

The plot is simple as Claude(Martin) and Ray(Murphy) got stalled in jail for rest of the life for a crime they didn't committed.

The real story is about life which goes upside down, as how small decision can cause such a major difference in our existence.

On one side we see Ray Gibson who is constantly full of hopes and on the other side Claude Banks who is a little afraid as pessimistic he becomes as per time.

The growth of the characters is shown very cleverly here as how they develop from the 20s to the 90s, their love-hate is so hilarious and memorable.

All the other casts on top carry out a tremendous role, and they are very underappreciated.

The movie elevates many issues on how individuals of color were treated back then, the civil rights movement, how the nation has experienced the change.

Personally, I will keep this movie as one of my most influential life-changing movies."

199,sullivans_travels,critics,fresh,p,"The genius of this classic opening scene is that Sullivan's Travels is both screwball comedy and socially conscious melodrama  as well as a satire of socially conscious melodrama, and a serious apologetic for crowd-pleasing comedy."
200,sullivans_travels,audience,4.5,p,"A rich and highly successful producer of escapist entertainment movies gets tired of doing so and wants to go out and explore the world of the poor and downtrodden. He tries several times to do so, but farcically ends up back in his rich surroundings. Not that his life is all good...the woman he married strictly to save on taxes has cost him far more money than he saved, and she is having an affair with his manager.

Finally Sullivan does manage to escape his wealthy home, meeting a lovely down-and-out actress in the process. Then he truly learns about how the other half lives...and why there is a market for escapist entertainment.

Not only does the movie succeed in farce, but it also doesn't glamorize the poor. It mentions there are thugs and scumbags as well as simply unfortunate among the poor. As someone who has known poor people myself, I felt that the movie is right on target in that respect."
201,sullivans_travels,audience,5.0,p,"Absurd slapstick, clever wit, and playful romance all in one!

Preston Sturges' romantic comedy-drama Sullivan's Travels (1941) is a whirlwind of emotions and laughter. Sturges' direction is fascinating and engaging as he opens Sullivan's Travels with a rooftop train fight, into witty banter, then proceeds into serious poverty drama, and all manner of other scenarios. Stuart Gilmore's editing keeps Sullivan's Travels down a sleek 91 minutes of all laughs and tears with quick cuts around all the action straight to the humor. Preston Sturges' writing is quite clever and sincere as he openly mocks how Hollywood wants to be seen as artistic and trying to change society, while allowing for the reality of audiences preferring the simple pleasure brought by comedies and laughing collectively.

 Sturges concludes that the catharsis of viewers laughing together during comedies is greater in the immediate nature of moviegoing compared to pretentious and depressing dramas for the simple fact that people like to see comedies more. The comedic relief from comedies is an escapist fantasy to deliver viewers from their low wages, poor jobs, and scarce lifestyles. But, Sullivan's Travels proves that getting the viewer to laugh is as significant as a drama making the audience cry in despair.

John F. Seitz' cinematography looks great for all the different wide shots needed to capture a blistering car chase to homeless people standing in line at the food banks in order to survive. Seitz captures it all. Charles Bradshaw and Leo Shuken's score is perky for all the silly comedy, ravishing for the romance, and heartfelt during the serious moments of reflection. Wally Westmore's make-up delivers one ethereal beauty for Veronica Lake's face to gritty mud on Joel McCrea's hobo look. Edith Head's costumes for Veronica Lake are dazzling with diamonds and flowing robes. Head's style is immaculate and makes the already gorgeous Lake all the more dreamy and memorable.

Veronica Lake is stunning from the first moment she appears on screen. Lake steals the entire film with her fearless line delivery, sultry personality, mysterious persona, playful flirting, fun actions, and hilarious sense of humor. Veronica Lake could not possibly have been a bore as she lights up the screen with more than her iconic peek-a-boo haircut, but also her bubbly whimsy and endearing wit. I adored Veronica Lake in Sullivan's Travels.

Look, Joel McCrea is funny, charming, and lively in Sullivan's Travels as he goes from absurd slapstick, ridiculous banter about the importance of movies, to tender romance with Lake, then to heartfelt empathy for the poor. However, see Sullivan's Travels for Veronica Lake's daring forwardness, unforgettable charisma, classic beauty, and sweet charm."
202,sullivans_travels,audience,3.0,p,"One part sophisticated comedy, one part action adventure, one part Marx Brothers..Kind of all over the place."
203,sullivans_travels,audience,4.0,p,"This movie was easy to watch and enjoyable. Veronica Lake plays a damsdrel in distress, hard on her-luck actress trying to make a way for hersels,
Meets Joel in a cafe in which he is trying out being a hobo for a new film, she buys him
Breakfast and tags along for the ride.

A very believable story, friendship turned romance (if the movie continues). I'd imagine he would have placed her in some
Movies. 

Scenery is all over the place; train yards, production room, cafe, car rides, airplane, hotels, etc 

Easy to watch and heartwarming, I'd recommend"
204,sullivans_travels,audience,3.5,p,"Easy to like early on, Sullivan's Travels loses steam in much of its second half, moving from lighthearted, charming comedy to a somewhat wandering and strange melodramatic twist (including a hobo who happened to have stolen Sullivan's shoes earlier in the film before independently running across him much later), before gradually righting itself with a surprising thematic depth that was not previously hinted at; the film not only displays an informed and progressive treatment of African Americans for 1941, but reveals a sophisticated understanding of comedy as a means of sincere storytelling. I can't say that the two halves are particularly well reconciled even if they are meant to explicitly contrast (they feel like two different films), but each has its own merits. Despite explicitly poking fun at Capra a bit, the film has some real power in its naive early charm and storyline that somewhat echoes the beloved director. I'm convinced that much of the film's reputation is based on its contemporary depiction of Hollywood, and later generations of critics and producers that love to recognize Sullivan's combination of self-loathing and creative genius in themselves. (3.5/5)"
205,sullivans_travels,audience,4.5,p,"One of the great oldies. So much to enjoy about this early portrayal of Shia Leboeuf's year slumming it. For all that the plot rips along at a great pace, there's no doubting the star is Veronica Lake who is a classic old skool beauty of the silver screen. I basically want to marry her, not like now, cos she's dead but you know, the old living version of her. Absolute wowzers of a woman. Lead actor does a grand job too, whatever his name is."
206,sullivans_travels,audience,4.0,p,"Sullivan's Travels is a hidden gem of a movie. People don't talk about it much anymore, but it's one I think more people should watch. It features witty dialogue and a clever story that skillfully shifts between comedic farce and compelling drama. Plus, it's entertaining to watch Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake play off each other. Yes, it's a little dated and kind of cheesy, but I'd recommend Sullivan's Travels to anyone who enjoys the experience of going to the movies."
207,sullivans_travels,audience,4.5,p,"For the majority of its runtime, Sullivan's Travels is an exceedingly well done screwball comedy with some elements of slapstick. Preston Sturges' dialogue is sharp and funny and it is perfectly delivered by a charismatic Joel McCrea and an endearing Veronica Lake. Lake is unfortunately underused, her character arrives kind of late and then is left behind when McCrea's Sullivan, a film director and champion of the poor, is mugged and soon after imprisoned. The story then significantly shifts in tone, which provides for fewer laughs (on the part of the audience at least, not the convicts watching Mickey Mouse) but enables Sullivan to fulfill his goal of seeing what it's like to be destitute, without the comfort of money and privilege of fame. The film confirms its true purpose as a satire of the film industry, Sturges achieving just what Sullivan wants to by having us watch his character try to do it."
208,sullivans_travels,audience,2.5,n,A good story but hardly a classic because it exposes the harshness of homelessness in the 1930's and early 40's  in America (watch any other movie about hardship of the 30's).
209,sullivans_travels,audience,5.0,p,"For a film about abject poverty, this actually has everything: Nuanced social commentary on issues of class antagonism, inequity, the justice system, race; rapid-fire and timeless wit; Veronica Lake; a silent short-film in its middle; metatextual satire; Veronica Lake's peekaboo hairstyle. Ironically, a lesser filmmaker with poorer gifts would have spread the wealth."

It's a great fun movie that you can spend watching for hours and hours. It's really an enjoyable film. The story is really good where Mike Myers and Dana Carvey play the 2 goofy guys that run a show and a lot of hilarious things go on. And Rob Lowe is a friend of theirs that support them while they do their own show. The cast is great. I highly recommend checking out Wayne's world. It's a really fun movie to pop in and get a lot of laughs out of it. Such a great one.

La película es un entretenimiento ligero y bromas impredecibles, junto con el gran trabajo de los actores que hicieron que el material funcionara a través de una buena actuación.

Lo mejor de todo es que la película no se sobrecargó de humor malo y típico. Si podes ver una película una y otra vez sin aburrirte, esta es una de ellas. Sin embargo creo que los hermanos Farrelly junto con Jim Carrey (sin desmerecer a Jeff Daniels que también hace un gran trabajo) hacen que la película sea única."

The movie is light entertainment and hit and miss jokes, but like Monty Python, the actors made the material work through good acting. The chemistry between the lead characters was perfect, and there were clever bits such as the dog van ""peeing gas"" and their unwittingly bringing their would-be assassin on the road with them, only to unintentionally have him poison himself.

116,best_in_show,audience,1.0,n,I thought it was a stupid movie. We rented it based on critic and audience ratings. I cannot believe that it was rated so high. It stunk!   Only Fred Willard's character as a host of the dog show was funny.  Can't believe I spent four bucks to rent it.
117,best_in_show,audience,3.5,p,A quirky comedy with great performances.
118,best_in_show,audience,5.0,p,Christopher Guest's best film. Almost every scene is laugh out loud. On most lists of best comedies of all time.
119,best_in_show,audience,3.5,p,"Not funny enough to be considered one of the funniest even though as an improv comedy turns out cringey, but introduces Christopher Guest's directorial influence under social satire to find before and after with manageable laughs from a nice cast trying their best to cover the huge awkwardness.

121,spaceballs,critics,rotten,n,Space films are Mel Brooks' latest target in this Star Wars parody that might be appropriately titled Schtick Wars.
122,spaceballs,critics,rotten,n,[Mel] Brooks continues to be a better producer for others than a director of his own movies. [Full Review in Spanish]
123,spaceballs,critics,rotten,n,"A very unfortunate script, a rampant direction, a soulless montage. [Full Review in Spanish]"
124,spaceballs,critics,fresh,p,Many of Brooks' films are hysterical in their own right but Spaceballs manages to take on a world of its own.
125,spaceballs,critics,fresh,p,"Spaceballs remains a funny enough movie on its own, even after all these years."
126,spaceballs,critics,fresh,p,"It`s a close call on recommending this movie, but ``Spaceballs`` does have some big laughs that are not to be missed"
127,spaceballs,critics,fresh,p,"This sendup by director Mel Brooks incorporates the silliest aspects of all the major space adventures of the last decade, and the whole is a hilarious combination of its parts."

131,spaceballs,critics,rotten,n,"It's mostly forced humor all the way, a movie that rarely measures up to adequate kitsch."
132,spaceballs,critics,fresh,p,"The film's low-tech styling is roughly the cardboard inversion of the cinematic machines it parodies, and Brooks seems less inclined than usual to push the overkill urges too far."
133,spaceballs,critics,fresh,p,Goofy parody mocks the Star Wars series.
134,spaceballs,critics,fresh,p,"Ainda que no consiga recapturar a acidez e a inteligncia de seus esforos da primeira fase da carreira, Brooks consegue divertir graas a algumas belas sacadas e ao simples conceito de Moranis como Dark Helmet."

136,spaceballs,critics,fresh,p,"Despite the dirty jokes hidden in plain sight ('Never underestimate the power of the Schwartz!'), Spaceballs is a PG-rated comedy that makes silliness sublime. [Blu-ray]"

146,spaceballs,audience,3.5,p,"This hilarious take on the space genre spoofing classics like Star Wars and Star Trek. The story is wonky yet hilarious, and when you really think about it doesn't make a ton of sense, but that is the fun of it."
147,spaceballs,audience,3.5,p,"It is a very cheesy film but also has a lot of bad acting but it makes up with the constant jokes going after the star wars films. It is definitely makes for a good parody, although considered a family move it does have a few dirty or more adult like scenes that parents may want to watch out for."

182,the_grand_budapest_hotel,critics,fresh,p,"Amongst the whole spread of frequent Anderson collaborators, it is Ralph Fiennes, in the spotlight, who makes the most of every second he has on-screen. The end result is a flurry of cotton candy feelings."

189,the_grand_budapest_hotel,critics,fresh,p,"At 45 the Wes Anderson metaphor reaches its peak and is still more polymorphic than ever. The Grand Budapest Hotel is another eccentricity of its world, where tragicomedy wraps itself of dreams without the need to wake up. [Full review in Spanish]"

192,the_grand_budapest_hotel,critics,fresh,p,The desire to show fantastic worlds and tell stories in the face of the inevitable march of time and destructive forces is at the core of the film. Anderson's films are beginning to show the soul beneath the exactitude.

200,the_grand_budapest_hotel,audience,4.5,p,"The Grand Budapest Hotel is a Crime/Adventure film produced by Wes Anderson in 2014. It takes place in a fictional town, Zubrowka in 1932 between the wars. In this film, we follow the story of Zero Moustafa who was hired as a lobby boy by M. Gustave, the owner of The Grand Budapest Hotel. After a rich woman, one of M. Gustave's lovers, Madame D mysteriously dies, we follow the adventures of Zero to help M. Gustave escape from being framed and to solve the mystery of who killed her.

A single aspect of the film that stood out to me was the usage of the cameras when filming. Rather than the camera following the actors or leading the actors, the camera was mostly static. This made the film stand out and funny in a sense. It also gave it a more storytelling view which was what the film is based on. Having a static camera that stayed in one place also brought out many small details in the film that you wouldn't usually see in many other films. The usage of a static camera angle presented the many small details showing in this film combined with its storytelling aspect is genius.

Wes Anderson's film, The Grand Budapest Hotel takes on a mystery aspect while giving you a few laughs. I would give this film a solid 4.5/5 just because I liked it. The film was funny and very entertaining."
201,the_grand_budapest_hotel,audience,4.0,p,Love the colors and the Actors in the Movie the story Is not my Favorite Wes Anderson  Movie but will always recommend to see to see inside the mind of this artist. Saoirse Ronan!!
202,the_grand_budapest_hotel,audience,3.5,p,"The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) directed by Wes Anderson is an adventurous comedy. Gustave H. (Raph Fiennes) is a well-renowned concierge at the Grand Budapest Hotel amidst a war in the 1930s. Gustave is known for making ""friendships"" with the older wealthy women that stay at the hotel. Unfortunately, one of the women Gustave H. is well acquainted with suddenly dies. Gustave H. and Zero (Tony Revolori), his lobby boy in training, travel to the old women's funeral and Gustave H. is gifted with an extremely important painting. Due to its popularity, Gustave H. is framed for the old women's murder and he must attempt to clear his name

Throughout this film, symmetry catches the eyes of the audience. Wes Anderson does this by not only keeping the camera in the center but also placing chairs, tables, people even, on either side of the camera. If you were to draw a vertical line down the middle of the screen both sides would be balanced. Something is satisfying in knowing that the background, or setting, being shown is perfect when the character and what they are going through is far from it. The color palette that is used throughout the film highlight how life is seen inside and outside of the hotel. Because of the war, the are lots of blues, grays, and browns. This highlights the ruggedness of the war.  In the hotel, the colors are more vibrant due to its popularity. The colors purple, pink, and red give the hotel a whimsical feel. What I enjoyed about this film is that it focuses on the artistry of the film. Wes Anderson uses actors that do amazing jobs, therefore as the director, he can focus on the colors, camera, and the overall aesthetic of the film.

I would recommend this movie and all Wes Anderson films for that matter. This story that he gives us in this film is filled with drama and adventure that has a bittersweet ending. The dialogue is also witty and funny with a hint of adult language. The fact that it is being narrated by two different people in different eras is what makes this film feel a bit more real. Yet the cinematography keeps a childlike element that doesn't take focus away from the acting. This film has enough heart and action, but a lesson can be learned as well. I rate this film 3 ½ stars."

2,peewees_big_adventure,critics,fresh,p,Tim Burton's first (and best) movie...
3,peewees_big_adventure,critics,fresh,p,It's a true original -- a comedy maverick that looks and feels like no other movie I know.
4,peewees_big_adventure,critics,rotten,n,"It's a bold attempt to do something dazzlingly original, although some of the gags are spectacularly unfunny and Pee-wee's nervous prattling can become irritating."
5,peewees_big_adventure,critics,fresh,p,"Burton demonstrates his knack for building seemingly dynamic meta-worlds inside our own world, depicting Pee Wee's own journey as exciting, harrowing, and often times scary."
6,peewees_big_adventure,critics,fresh,p,The film's inventiveness is on display from the get-go.
7,peewees_big_adventure,critics,fresh,p,"Chiefly successful because of its commitment to an artistic ideal: make something that looks, talks, feels, and moves like a cartoon."
8,peewees_big_adventure,critics,fresh,p,A purely creative movie that one must admit has no equal in cinema history (for better or worse). [Blu-ray]
9,peewees_big_adventure,critics,fresh,p,"But perhaps Pee-wee's appeal lies precisely in the slightly discomfiting uncertainty of his persona... insufferably giddy, occasionally malevolent, and completely indefatigable; demented, irritating, narcissistic -- and infectiously funny."
10,peewees_big_adventure,critics,rotten,n,"Reubens always lets us feel superior to his creation, and when his character slips, as it does more than once in this first feature outing, his own condescension shows through."
11,peewees_big_adventure,critics,fresh,p,"It's surreal, funny, clever and disarming in equal measures."
12,peewees_big_adventure,critics,rotten,n,Fair warning: this movie could induce terminal boredom in adults and rot the minds of the young.
13,peewees_big_adventure,critics,fresh,p,Two stars were born with the release of this film -- one in front of the camera and one behind it.
14,peewees_big_adventure,critics,fresh,p,"Burton's first feature revels in the weird, the unpredictable, the infantile and the absurd. A dazzling debut."
15,peewees_big_adventure,critics,fresh,p,"Children should love the film and adults will be dismayed by the light brushstrokes with which Paul Reubens (one of three credited screenwriters, but star-billed under his stage name, Pee-wee Herman) suggests touches of Buster Keaton and Eddie Cantor."
16,peewees_big_adventure,critics,fresh,p,"The filmmakers create a zany and surreal world for Pee-wee yet it all seems perfectly natural and credible. Plus, it's all infused with a subdued yet rampant silliness that's enchanting."
17,peewees_big_adventure,critics,fresh,p,"It might start off silly, but by the end, it's skewered tons of film clichs, offered our first glimpse at Tim Burton's cinematic vision, and, most crucially, made you laugh more times than you can count."
18,peewees_big_adventure,critics,fresh,p,Tim Burton's visual imagination proves a perfect match for Pee-wee's fanciful exploits.

21,peewees_big_adventure,audience,3.5,p,"Tim Burton's debut film, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, shows much of the playfulness that would be evident in many of his later films.  When Pee-Wee Herman's bike is stolen, he embarks on a cross country odyssey to retrieve his beloved mode of transportation.  While some of the laughs miss their mark, there are enough moments of genuine levity to hold the whole family's attention, including the iconic barroom dance routine to Tequila.  Danny Elfman's score is fantastic, Paul Reubens is charming as the seemingly asexual man-child Pee-Wee, and Burton's directorial choices are spot-on considering the subject matter."
22,peewees_big_adventure,audience,5.0,p,"Genius. This film is a love letter to B movies, to cinephiles, and to hidden adult humor posing as a children's film. If you love films to the point that you study them, if you see the dark side of children's fiction, and if you can't get enough of films so bad they are good then this film was MADE for you. It's just genius. Let's break down to the essentials of filmmaking:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

1. Writing: Like I said, this film was meant to be an insider joke/love letter to cinephiles. It's genius. It's structurally set up to put more emphasis on Pee-Wee's reaction to his bike getting stolen than the stealing of the bike, or even his establishing of his love of the bike. This is a character piece and the film is designed to showcase that. The Pacing is perfect. The journey is rolling along on an ever off kilter design. It's a world where nothing makes sense and that creates an insane internal logic that works perfectly.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

2. Acting: No one delivers an off performance because no one delivers a ""normal"" performance. This is surrealism not realism. Everyone is overacting. Everyone is perfect in their roles. The performances in this film are perfect. This is exactly what you want for a film this insane. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Direction: Tim Burton is at his finest with this material. We can clearly see the genius here that will go on to do ""Beetlejuice,"" and ""Edward Siccorhands."" I don't know the story behind why he chose this film, but the genius we can see in the handling of this subject matter is seriously next level. He took a children's show level act and turned it into high art. He broke entertainment with this film and paved the road to everything from ""Spongebob"" to ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force."" This film rewrote the book when it comes to what would have normally been reduced to nothing more than children's entertainment can be.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Visuals: Once again this is a film that knows what it is perfectly. Even when the visuals falter it only reinforces the aesthetics of the film. Intent is reinforced with understanding here. It just works. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Score/Soundtrack: Danny Elfman found his groove with this film. It's proto-perfection for every thing him and Burton would do going on. There's just no flaws here. It ramps up when it needs to and it lays out the humdrum of the scenes that are meant to show the humdrum of Pee-Wee's journey. It's a perfect score which is something Elfman has delivered on multiple occasions.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall this gets a perfect 5/5 stars which doesn't mean it's a perfect film only that it perfectly achieves what it sets out to achieve and doesn't falter in any of the essential categories of film making."

26,peewees_big_adventure,audience,5.0,p,"Pee Wee's Big Adventure is one of non-stop laughter. It was hilarious in the 1980s and it's still hilarious today. The world needs more goofy, slap stick comedy like this. There's nothing offensive; there's nothing political in this film. It's just plain ol' all-American fun."
27,peewees_big_adventure,audience,1.0,n,"Imagine a movie led by one of TV's biggest psychopaths' in history...(other than Fred from Fred: The Movie) this is basically what this movie is. I was really looking forward to seeing what this movie could really be about, but ended up being possibly one of the most disappointing movies I've ever have seen in my entire life. Don't watch this movie. My overall ranking, 2/10."
28,peewees_big_adventure,audience,4.5,p,Pee-wee's Big Adventure is one of those films that will test your patience with the central character. Paul Reuben never managed to shake off the character and it remains his most recognised character after all these years. The film was a slight hit at the box office but the strength of the film lies in its craziness. Tim Burton was in his infancy as a filmmaker but he gives this film more creativity and showcases an early talent to create something unique. The first 10 minutes was a little rough as I had to get my head around the Pee-wee character but after that the film managed to settle into one of the cult gems from the era. I'm shocked I hadn't found this film earlier and it's a lost gem for collectors like myself. The plot allows the film to go any out there storyline and that's what makes this film great. 07/01/2021
29,peewees_big_adventure,audience,5.0,p,"A bonkers journey into the absurd.

Tim Burton's directorial debut feature film Pee-wee's Big Adventure (1985) is an insane absurdist comedy of absolute nonsense make even more ridiculous by virtue of Burton's demented direction. I laughed from the opening to the outlandish chase finale through Warner Bros. Studio Lot. Tim Burton's practical effects, endless gags, fast pace, and off kilter personality shine in his first film to start off his career into the obscene, strange, silly, and dark. Paul Reubens, Phil Hartman, and Michael Varhol's writing is very creative as they take a boy and his dog premise and flip it to a deranged manchild and his tricked out bicycle. Their words provide serious wit to add to Pee-wee's likable oddball character.

Paul Reubens himself is the key to making Pee-wee work on film. He's so eccentrically weird, but strangely endearing as this dumb idiot who adores his super fancy bike. He travels the country in search of his stolen bike, meeting every freak in Tim Burton's arsenal of caricatures. He's got such energetic charisma, that helium falsetto voice, goofy walk cycle, and impeccable comedic timing. He is Pee-wee Herman.

I adore Elizabeth Daily's performance as Pee-wee's girlfriend and bike mechanic Dottie. Tim Burton really cast legendary voice actress, Tommy from Rugrats and Buttercup from The Powerpuff Girls, as Pee-wee's fittingly saccharine girl. Diane Salinger is sweet as the waitress with Parisian dreams named Simone. 

Similarly, Mark Holton is perfectly repulsive as the rich snob and absolute slob Francis. Judd Omen's prisoner escapee Mickey is great as the tough guy opposite Reubens' effeminate Pee-wee. Alice Nunn's truck driver jump scare and wreck speech as Large Marge are fantastic. Dee Snider and Phil Hartman cameo. I love James Brolin and Morgan Fairchild's cameos at the end of Pee-wee's Big Adventure playing Pee-wee and Dottie.

Furthermore, Billy Weber's editing is very sharp and quickly cut, almost immediately getting you to the next joke for a brisk 91 minutes of laughs. Victor J. Kemper's creative cinematography uses every angle, perspective, and camera placement to get a visual gag chuckle in whenever he can. Pee-wee's Big Adventure is shot excellently, honestly. David L Snyder's production design and art direction make everything in Pee-wee's Big Adventure look like a psychotic fever dream with strange pastel colors and oddly sized things. 

Danny Elfman's magnificent score speaks for itself with massive swells of intense Gothic symphonies that sets a darker atmosphere to Burton's debut. Aggie Guerard Rodgers' costumes are goofy and playful like only Pee-wee could pull off.

In short, Pee-wee's Big Adventure is not just a fun family comedy, but also an original picture from iconic American director Tim Burton. It's a true comedy classic movie adults will appreciate."

51,the_in_laws_1979,audience,3.5,p,"The fathers-to-be of an engaged couple meet and become involved in a high-stakes series of deadly hijinks littered with pratfalls, silliness, and downright zany antics. Arkin and Falk delight as straight man and comic relief and constantly play off each other throughout a series of increasingly wild events. Serpentine, Sheldon! Good for fans of Arkin and silly 70s physical comedies."
52,the_in_laws_1979,audience,5.0,p,"Easily one of the funniest movies ever made and certainly a forgotten classic that shockingly few people under 40 have taken the opportunity to enjoy.

We used to quote this film daily when I was in grammar school, often without realizing it.

Plus the shots of old NYC are priceless."
53,the_in_laws_1979,audience,5.0,p,"Now, even more than when I saw it in the theater 40 years ago, I love it. It is a truism that ""The artist strikes from the transcendent"", and there is one moment in particular in this gem of a movie where that strike is very pronounced...but I won't spoil it for you by telling you what it was for me. Falk and Arkin are fabulous. It is a very funny movie, but even more than that is the humanity it reveals. It might very well have been titled: The In-laws and Out-laws."
54,the_in_laws_1979,audience,5.0,p,"This is one, crazy, surreal film as clever in story as A fish Called Wanda ,plus the added Mel Brook like characters that fuel this hilarious trip!"
55,the_in_laws_1979,audience,4.0,p,"I was a bit worried that The In-Laws would not appeal to me because it has a story structure that I generally hate. I have always struggled with movies that establish a likable character and then spend the entire runtime torturing the poor guy/girl. I have a nasty tendency to sympathize acutely with the character, so it feels like I’m the one being put through the ringer. Sure enough that seems to be the basic plot structure of The In-Laws and I could see myself hating this movie if not for one thing...the cast. I did sympathize with Alan Arkin’s character to some degree, but he plays the character with such a humorous desperation that I was chuckling rather than cringing. He has this tendency to shut down as if he’s shell-shocked and can’t even figure out what to say, and every time he went there I was genuinely laughing out loud. His counterpart, Peter Falk, is also perfect for his role in The In-Laws. He has this light-hearted personality where it feels like he is completely unphased by all the insanity going on around them. Since he’s not taking things too seriously, it also allows me to not worry so much about the bad things happening to Arkin’s character. The entire film is a little heightened so that it almost feels farcical, but not to the extreme. You can’t spend too much time overthinking the logic of the film, because it would fall apart under that kind of scrutiny, but it still has enough narrative structure to tell a compelling story. It’s this goofy tone that allowed me to have a great time laughing along as each new adventure began. The In-Laws might not be the greatest comedy film of all time, but it feels like a classic that I should have seen sooner. I expect to laugh at this one for years to come."
56,the_in_laws_1979,audience,4.0,p,Alan Arkin and Peter Falk make a neat team as a Dentist and a CIA agent in this crazy comedy of a miss-matched pair in a series of desperate situations. Whether in NY City or a foreign dictator's war-torn desert nation they are constantly in peril and uproarious danger. Many funny lines and crazy characters make this a fast-moving romp from start to finish. Dialogue is slightly rough at the start but settles down to concentrate on the fun situations as it moves along. Will please fans of the two stars and features a very funny turn by Richard Libertini (that has to be seen!) as a crazy general.
57,the_in_laws_1979,audience,4.0,p,Wonderful comedic performances by Falk and Arkin.
58,the_in_laws_1979,audience,5.0,p,"This movie is a national treasure.  When it came out, everything was fresh, and after it, it was all copied in other movies.  So while you might think the jokes are old, its only because it was copied.  This movie is insane, and the tagline ""the certifiably crazy persons movie"" is no hype, just honest.  I frankly loved this movie.  Every joke seems to work.  And Arkin and Falk are the dream team.  The people behind the making of this movie are geniuses.  I just couldn't stop laughing.  There are just sooo many lines that work.  Vince is obviously clinically insane, and seems to take relish in proving it every 5 minutes.  We are witness to a clearly average person, played by Arkin, being slowly and steadily driven into Falk's insanity.  We watch Arkin go through the things we would go through, as we fast-tracked to the booby-hatch.  Clearly, Falk wants to completely destroy Arkins life, and is supremely unrelenting in this regard.  You might think he'll get a break now and then, but it never does happen.  It's just one disaster after another.  Each one worse then the last.  You can't help but put yourself in his place.  Arkin is taking him down his rabbit hole, and there is no coming back.  The movie is lovable, as are the characters.  In the cinematic world, this is art, crafted with skill and love.  If you can't laugh at this movie, you should see a doctor.  You're probably dead.  That or psychotic.  This movie is in my top 10 funniest movies EVER."

Don't bother trying to find the plot though.  It's more fun to go along for the prank playing wild ride while singing along with the energetic soundtrack.  If you think too hard about it, it isn't any better than American Pie.  There's a lot of dated humor but that makes for the charm."
81,national_lampoons_animal_house,audience,4.5,p,"One of the best comedy movies ever. Script, acting, direction, all excellent. I hold back 1/2 star only because it misses one element that defines the best comedy: a touch of pathos and realism. 

As an example I can offer the film ""There's Something About Mary"". Animal House mostly makes up for that lack with over-the-top, original humor and situations, so still one of the classic comedy movies of all time."
82,national_lampoons_animal_house,audience,4.5,p,"While not as flawless as some claim nor as cutting-edge as it once was, as well as containing a LOT of jokes that were subsequently done to death in later movies, Animal House is a genuinely excellent R-Rated Comedy that is, by and large, still very funny today.  The situations that the characters find themselves in are quite entertaining, and the characters, primarily the protagonists, are varied and charismatic, despite the fact that half of them are semi-reprehensible people (with just enough moral code to sustain likeability).  Now, I did say earlier that the movie isn't as cutting-edge as it was at the time of its release, that's not to say that this movie isn't still funny; most ""biting"" movies, once decades old, come off as just lame and quaint, but Animal House still packs quite a number of punches.  Some of the jokes are not only well written but very well executed, both by the actors and by the Directing, and some of the ideas at play (the big one being a road trip where the guys pose as oblivious boyfriends to recently deceased college girls for the purposes of a sympathy lay) are still incredibly funny in a horrific way.  Honestly, I don't think this movie has ever been outdone - in many ways, it's still the best College Comedy ever made; not stating that others haven't been quite funny since, but this is one of those rare >40 Year Old Classics that people call great, and actually is great."
83,national_lampoons_animal_house,audience,1.5,n,These guys should have been shot long before the movie ended!!
84,national_lampoons_animal_house,audience,2.5,n,"This is a period piece whose main claim to fame was that it started the trend of screwball comedies in the following decades, silly and rebellious kids against dense and strait-laced adults. The story is about a fraternity in 1963 which engages in constant hooliganism, to the point where the dean of the college finally wants it shut down.

After being warned of the dean's intentions, the people in the fraternity of course engage in even more of the bad behavior that got them into trouble in the first place. Big surprise-the college shuts down the fraternity. On top of that, the members of the fraternity's leadership are expelled from the college itself due to poor academic scores-and the dean reminds them that they can no longer use college deferments to avoid the military draft. So they decide to wreak revenge by sabotaging the upcoming alumni parade.

The movie is basically a group of fraternity-related gags, some funny, but others lame or gross. The parade scene at the end provides the only major laughs in the movie, but the rest is basically boring."

89,national_lampoons_animal_house,audience,4.0,p,"This movie was a game changer.   It is as hysterically funny and raunchy as you get.  This movie has been imitated for decades but never surpassed.   This National Lampoon's comedy about a fringe Fraternity of misfits trying to navigate the waters of college and young adulthood is brilliantly humorous and engaging.    John Belushi has a relatively minor role, but it brought international attention to the film because it was such a stand out performance.    The cast is truly ensemble and the sum of their whole is greater than any individual cast member's part.    The dialogue is well scripted and memorable.    Lines from the film are still quoted today.   The delivery by the actors is impeccable.    The visual gags are as funny as the lines of dialogue.    This one is well directed with a great understanding of comedic time.  The straight players in the film, like Dean Wormer and Donald Sutherland do as much to make the scenes work as the comedic actors.  I watch this about every 5 years and it still holds up."

I'm also a big fan of the gateway drugs montage that starts with a six pack of beers and ends with the characters in a flophouse doing heroin.

The script was full of non-sequitur meant to flip the audience's expectation on its head and it succeeded. The casting choices were fantastic and some of the subplots were comedic gold, like Garofalo & Hyde Pierce's awkward attempts at a relationship. Most of the jokes landed for me in a ""I didn't expect that"" sort of way. I was also impressed with how far they stretched their budget, from the props to the vehicles to the large size of the cast. Hindsight is obviously 20/20 but with it I bet they would've promoted Poehler to a more prominent role in the movie.

173,hot_rod,audience,5.0,p,"This movie is dorky in all senses of the word. It's quotable, whacky, and dense with jokes. Its humor fits the vibe it's going for, it's the world as seen from the perspective of a 20-something less-than-mature stuntman and his group of nerdy socially inept friends. 

It may not be a movie to brew over by the fireside, but it's sure as hell a good movie to watch with friends. You will be quoting lines of dialogue from this movie to eachother for years."

203,trainwreck,audience,0.5,n,"I don't know why Amy Schumer is given such a hard time. I don't know why she's called a no-talent hack. Amy Schumer actually has a rare gift, and if anyone in Hollywood needs to engage in their favorite past time of plagiarization, they really need to consider making Amy Schumer the simultaneous head of all their studios. I am also glad that the glorious nation Of China and their most esteemed leader gave John Cena permission to be in this film. John Cena's girlfriend's boyfriend appreciates it too."
204,trainwreck,audience,3.5,p,"Appreciated after rewatching it a few years later for all the cameos from SNL, stand-up, and other movies.  Good heart, funny if you don't take it too seriously. Good casual rewatch for future."
205,trainwreck,audience,5.0,p,I don't like rom coms. At all. But this one made me lose my shit on numerous times. Amy Shumer really surprised me as actor and writer.
206,trainwreck,audience,1.0,n,"Everyone loved this one, so please, don't listen to me. I am like the reason Schumer got Netflix to disable their comments section (rude!). 

There are definitely some funny moments in this one, but, overall, Schumer's character came off like a sexual predator, sorry. Let me put it to you this way, if you had a date, and a man jumped on you aggressively, and you were like ""Whoa whoa whoa! Slow down!"" and he was like ""It's okay, we're f'ing!""...No. You should always be able to reverse the roles in sexual scenarios and have them still be consensual. There are ways to draw out a sexually aggressive character without doing this.

Plus, there was a shooting at a theatre during this film's showing, and now Hollywood's like ""Time for a sequel!"". No. Take the warnings from the universe. How many theatrical releases can you think of where a shooting took place? The real life Joker came out during ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and assassinated a bunch of people, and...""Trainwreck."" 

What I do like about Amy is she is backing sexual assault victims left and right. So, while I think her stand-up and films aren't doing her any good, I do think she's doing good things in most of her activism, and she seems like a great Mom. I will check out her new TV series when it comes out, and since it's on Hulu, she can feel safe in knowing that all of us trolls go where it's open season at throwing rotten tomatoes at the actors heads like we did at Medieval Days, as there are still some sites that won't censor public opinion. Please don't censor public opinion, Amy. It's not gonna look good for you in the future when the future trolls find out you were the one who wouldn't let us comment publicly about the things we invest a lot of time and money in, even if we hate on them."
207,trainwreck,audience,4.0,p,"This romantic comedy is far from being a trainweck. It deftly subverts and makes fun of genre clichés while balancing moments of edgy humor and tender emotions. Its excellent ensemble cast, sharp jokes, memorable and relatable characters, and Amy Schumer's clever script and hilarious lead performance makes this a worthy addition to Judd Apatow's filmography."
208,trainwreck,audience,3.0,p,"It's actually very funny, well acted, good delivery,  fun characters (especially the dad!). My only complaint is that it is too long. Every scene should be 5 minutes shorter ha ha."
209,trainwreck,audience,5.0,p,"What makes Trainwreck a fantastic comedy film is that it has funny humour, great acting and some of the best romance I've seen period. I know most comedy films try to be funny with their humor but failed, tried to have great acting but also failed, even tried to add some romance but ends up being clique (or in other words, just come out of nowhere), but with this film you know they take every bad elements of those films and make it even better than before."

9,10010667-hangover,critics,fresh,p,"In the case of The Hangover, Phillips made a decent diversion, but no classic; like its heroes you'll have a good time, then forget most of it when you wake up the following morning. It's a movie, not a film."

24,10010667-hangover,audience,4.0,p,"Once you recognize the need to totally suspend disbelief, The Hangover becomes one of the funniest movies in recent memory.  Four friends (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha, Zach Galifianakis) head from Los Angeles to Las Vegas for the stereotypical bachelor party.  Predictably and hilariously, things go horribly wrong over the course of the evening, leading to a frantic search for the missing groom.  Highlighted by a Mike Tyson's tiger and non-stop non sequiturs from Galifianakis' character, the movie is unrelenting in its quest for laughs.  Despite the fact that some of the gags miss the mark, there are more than enough laugh-out-loud moments to compensate."

51,stripes,audience,4.0,p,"This classic comedy was really good. Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, John Candy, Warren Oates, P.J.

57,stripes,audience,5.0,p,This is my favorite Bill Murray film of all time and also one of my favorite films of all time. I thought this was a really funny film.

People were happier back then, more playful and didn't take life too seriously.  There was no social media cancel culture and people actually used cash.  This time period was the beginning of the end in terms of the USA becoming a corporation."

83,some_like_it_hot,audience,4.0,p,"Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are fantastic in this well ahead of its time comedy about two down and out musicians who witness a crime and have to go under cover to get away from the mob who did it.

Not only are Lemmon and Curtis great here but the film also includes the magnificent Marilyn Monroe, who brings that extra ingredient that makes this film timeless."

89,some_like_it_hot,audience,4.0,p,"Frequently hailed as the finest comedy film of all time, a status I sadly can't agree with, Some Like It Hot benefits from a creative script and a premise that, while frequently stretched to breaking point, still provides a lot of laughs. The film is unevenly paced in places, and some scenes, especially the one with Curtis and Monroe on the yacht together, go on for way too long. It's a film that, while undoubtably hilarious, is in need of editing down, with about 20 minutes that could easily be lost. But with that said, I can see why its still popular over 50 years after its release. Curtis, Lemmon and Monroe all have fantastic chemistry with each other, and the ease with which they play off each other is what usually makes the film shine. For me, Jack Lemmon's performance is the one that stands out the most, since a man of his energy and charisma is nigh impossible to overshadow, and he gives it his all in every scene he's in. There are other comedies I laughed at more, and others I have greater appreciation for, but I can safely say that Some Like It Hot is a movie that every earnest film buff absolutely needs to see, whether for its crazy antics, its laugh out loud jokes or the way it gleefully stomped all over the uptight standards of its day."

101,bank_dick,critics,fresh,p,One of the definitive W.C. Fields films.
102,bank_dick,critics,fresh,p,
103,bank_dick,critics,fresh,p,"Not Fields' best, but a classic all the same."
104,bank_dick,critics,fresh,p,Fields' last major film is fantastic.
105,bank_dick,critics,fresh,p,
106,bank_dick,critics,fresh,p,"It's still great, exhibiting a far superior sense of wit and comic timing than virtually any film released in the last twenty years."
107,bank_dick,critics,fresh,p,"Wacky hijinks ensue, with some of the best one-liners in Fields' career herein. Excellent."
108,bank_dick,critics,fresh,p,"The Bank Dick is a highly revered film in the annals of screen comedy, and it is easy to see why."
109,bank_dick,critics,fresh,p,Probably Fields' best film.
110,bank_dick,audience,3.0,p,"W.C. Fields was a master at defining his persona and sticking to it, but that persona doesn't reach the same level of universality as Fields' silent era contemporaries; his dimwitted, 'henpecked' caricature is performed very ably but gets old fast, such that his near-monotone starts to sound like white noise as the film goes on. The Bank Dick reaches its greatest heights when it ignores the dialogue-heavy buffoonery of its main character and instead starts to dive into more classic physical comedy towards the finale, particularly the car chase and the many gags involved. The slow delivery by Fields gives the whole film a sluggish tone for long stretches, zapping it of the energy that other early sound comedians like the Marx Brothers and Laurel & Hardy had. Credit where it's due, though; The Bank Dick is much better realized than Fields' earlier classic It's a Gift, actually putting together something of a cohesive story rather than relying on loosely stitched-together scenes. (3/5)"
111,bank_dick,audience,5.0,p,The inimitable William Claude Dukenfield strikes again!  Some of the scenes have aged badly - primarily the car chase -  but the  laughs are timeless.
112,bank_dick,audience,5.0,p,"""Og Oggliby, sounds like a bubble in a bath tub""."
113,bank_dick,audience,5.0,p,"The best, GREATEST comedy movie ever made!"
114,bank_dick,audience,3.0,p,"1001 movies to see before you die.  If ever WC Fields made a good movie, this was it."
115,bank_dick,audience,4.5,p,"It's pronounced Sousé!
This is one of the 10 best slapstick comedies!"
116,bank_dick,audience,5.0,p,Hilarious movie. I wish they still made them like this. Definitely re-watch worthy. Buy it.
117,bank_dick,audience,4.0,p,This was my first W.C. Fields movie and I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The humour actually felt quite modern even though the film is from 1940.  Definitely worth checking out for lovers of classic comedies!
118,bank_dick,audience,5.0,p,Sometimes it's just nice to laugh at the wild antics of a brilliant clown. Such are the pleasures of W.C. Fields in The Bank Dick.
119,bank_dick,audience,3.0,p,"Eggbert Sousé (accent grave over the ""e"") is a bumbling drunk who barely supports his family and spends most of his time drinking.  Souse is slang for drunk and Eggbert always must remind people of the accent grave.  After he accidently foils a bank robbery, he is given a job at the bank as the security guard.  Typical of the work of W.C. Fields, a drunk with a shrewish wife, disapproving mother-in-law and awful children.  Entertaining, but not his best.  That goes to ""It's a Gift"" from 1934."
120,groundhog_day,critics,fresh,p,I find it a masterpiece of comedic timing that ultimately starts with the deceptively brilliant script from Danny Rubin.
121,groundhog_day,critics,fresh,p,"On top of the time travel elements, Groundhog Day is also a hilarious comedy and beautiful romance. While we get to know Phil throughout the film, you also get to know Rita and what a complex person she is..."
122,groundhog_day,critics,fresh,p,One of those rare cinematic occasions when extreme repetition only gets funnier.
123,groundhog_day,critics,fresh,p,The movie would be nothing without Murray's superb performance... Keep an eye on how his character develops in depth and self-awareness as he desperately looks for a way out of the rut.
124,groundhog_day,critics,fresh,p,A great comedy with a solid message that doesn't hinder the delivery of the comedy.
125,groundhog_day,critics,fresh,p,"Re-watching Groundhog Day yet again was pretty enlightening, actually!"
126,groundhog_day,critics,fresh,p,"Cult leader Keith Ranieri was my grade school classmate. What do we call his current prison situation? We call it ""Groundhog day."" Perhaps millennials aren't familiar with the facts about when and how this term became part of America's cultural lexicon..."
127,groundhog_day,critics,fresh,p,It would be impossible to understand the movie without that casual and inevitable tone delivered by Ramis and Murray. [Full Review in Spanish]
128,groundhog_day,critics,fresh,p,Murray's performance doesn't only elevate the film to a completely different level but also elevates the work being put in by the rest of the cast.
129,groundhog_day,critics,fresh,p,"With his shifts from smugness to weirdness to some kind of local heroism, Murray controls the picture throughout. But Ramis works ably with his oddly assorted supporting cast."
130,groundhog_day,critics,fresh,p,"Are we all just wasting time squandering eternity? The film doesn't make this accusation lightly. And it takes an outrageous concept, a big premise with a science-fiction spin, to level the idea in terms we accept and understand."
131,groundhog_day,critics,fresh,p,"Ramis and Murray achieve a harmony of wit and wisdom that works so effortlessly on you, on us all, the phrase ""Groundhog Day"" in American vernacular has become a synonym for dj vu."
132,groundhog_day,critics,fresh,p,"Murray, more often than not, is pretty unbearable; but here, playing a man who is unbearable, Murray begins convincingly, amusingly, and gets even more amusing as he metamorphoses."
133,groundhog_day,critics,fresh,p,"Harold Ramis's direction is nothing special, yet there is a beautiful, lip-smacking efficiency in the way that a great idea is touched off and followed to its conclusion."
134,groundhog_day,critics,fresh,p,"When it comes to existential drama comedies about self realizations in a fantastic setting, [it] is right up there with films like ""Her"" and ""Eternal Sunshine."""
135,groundhog_day,critics,rotten,n,"...the film's forgettable, padded-out nature confirms its place as a promising yet disposable high-concept comedy."
136,groundhog_day,critics,fresh,p,"The day is not a redo; it's a ""one more."""
137,groundhog_day,critics,fresh,p,"While Murray's deadpan putdowns and dry dismissals of provincial peccadilloes are the comic highlights, Groundhog Day is no supercilious rip of small-town U.S.A."
138,groundhog_day,critics,fresh,p,Precise and smart and fussed over without feeling fussy.
139,groundhog_day,critics,fresh,p,The legacy film of director Harold Ramis.
140,groundhog_day,audience,5.0,p,Timeless classic.  One of the best movies ever made.
141,groundhog_day,audience,5.0,p,"In a beautifully apt way, it's a movie I enjoy seeing time and time again."
142,groundhog_day,audience,5.0,p,seen it over 100 times and it only gets better.
143,groundhog_day,audience,3.0,p,"Hilarious in moments, but the story does drag on and on and on (intentionally, I assume) to a point of too much annoyance for its own good."
144,groundhog_day,audience,5.0,p,"A must see classic starring the lovable Bill Murray. It's hilarious, entertaining and still has a very serious edge to it. Honestly one of the best movies of all time and not afraid to say it. If you haven't seen it yet - please get it done"
145,groundhog_day,audience,4.5,p,Funny and deep. A classic.
146,groundhog_day,audience,5.0,p,Bill Murray lifting an interesting but limited premise to a classic.
147,groundhog_day,audience,3.5,p,"In a time when, for a lot of us, it seems like Groundhog Day is an every day occurence (for others, definitely not so much) this seems like a reasonable choice, even though I'm sure everyone has seen it. It's a terrific premise, produced with heart and humour, and to boot, Andie MacDowell doesn't have any misconceptions about the weather. Bill Murray is the perfect foil for Phil Connors, the man who finds himself reliving the same day over and over. There are benefits of course, but even as dark as the times currently seem, it's probably not a life you want to be living in the long term. So just watch Bill Murray struggle with it for a couple of hours instead."
148,groundhog_day,audience,3.5,p,First half was kinda slow and predictable if you've watched this type of movie before but the second half just felt really nice for the main character and you can see his development clearly.
149,groundhog_day,audience,3.5,p,The first time you see this you will think it's stupid.  This one has to be watched again to pick up on the underlying fun.
150,dr_strangelove,critics,fresh,p,"Probably Kubrick's biggest gamble, resulted in a classic that has aged finely. [Full review in Spanish]"
151,dr_strangelove,critics,fresh,p,"Few satires are stranger or sharper, and there are few funnier films that come from a weirder and braver starting point than Dr Strangelove."
152,dr_strangelove,critics,fresh,p,I think this is a film I will need to see again especially for the Sellars performances. But I really hope the opening scroll is correct and nothing like this can ever actually happen.
153,dr_strangelove,critics,fresh,p,"While still politically relevant, the Cold War audiences of the '60s were better primed to welcome the irony."
154,dr_strangelove,critics,fresh,p,Dr. Strangelove is one of [Stanley Kubrick's] very best movies.
155,dr_strangelove,critics,fresh,p,"Stanley Kubrick's classic black comedy, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, remains a genius political satire."
156,dr_strangelove,critics,fresh,p,"It was a most uncomfortable experience. It was about as funny as a creeping case of cancer... Despite this carping I must admit that Dr. Strangelove was a memorable film, one worth seeing and one which took courage to make and even to exhibit."
157,dr_strangelove,critics,fresh,p,"It struck me at the tine and it strikes me now that Dr. Strangelove is a brilliant and edifying, even a moral, movie."
158,dr_strangelove,critics,fresh,p,"...his film is a protest against the dehumanization which makes it possible for some strategists to mention ""acceptable"" casualties of tens of millions in the first few hours of a nuclear ""victory."""
159,dr_strangelove,critics,fresh,p,"Though the principals in the race to Armageddon may have changed since Kubrick's time, his film is still as effective a piece of satire as ever."
160,dr_strangelove,critics,fresh,p,"Age has not withered that final queasy nightmare of the mushroom clouds, set to Vera Lynn's hopeful We'll Meet Again - underscoring how the certainties of the second world war ceased to hold their meaning in the nuclear age."
161,dr_strangelove,critics,fresh,p,"Brilliant, bold, very funny, and terrifyingly plausible beneath its surface absurdities. (4k restoration and new short film)"
162,dr_strangelove,critics,fresh,p,"The satire and its execution, from George C. Scott to Peter Sellers in his three roles, is first and foremost what makes things work."
163,dr_strangelove,critics,fresh,p,"Nothing would seen to be farther apart than nuclear war and comedy, yet Kubrick's caper eloquently tackles a Fail-Safe subject with a light touch."
164,dr_strangelove,critics,fresh,p,Kubrick has shown before that he is a director of rare gifts. Dr. Strangelove brings them into full realization.
165,dr_strangelove,critics,fresh,p,Mr. Kubrick is a bold man: he has taken a whole complex of America's basic assumptions by the shoulders and given them a rough shaking.
166,dr_strangelove,critics,fresh,p,Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is the funniest and most serious American movie in a long time.
167,dr_strangelove,critics,fresh,p,"Take away the arch tone and deadpan ridiculousness, and the scenario is all too real."
168,dr_strangelove,critics,fresh,p,"Fifty-two years on, the movie is still more hip than most of what American filmmakers - Hollywood or indie - can muster."
169,dr_strangelove,critics,fresh,p,"The pre-eminent satire of cold-war paranoia, Dr. Strangelove is a hilarious and harrowing fable of systemised madness."
170,dr_strangelove,audience,4.5,p,Awesome movie for the most part.
171,dr_strangelove,audience,4.0,p,"In this film we got a mixture of a great directional work, the performances of Peter Sellers and George C. Scott and a lot, and I mean a lot of black humor. Pretty basic and bored sometimes in the 1/2 of the movie. 8/10"
172,dr_strangelove,audience,3.5,p,"A bit of an eccentric timepiece I guess, and pretty funny. Though also a bit antiseptic."
173,dr_strangelove,audience,5.0,p,"An entertaining movie which perfectly narrates its story. You are not much involved with the characters, which I personally cherish for such a film, thorough which you are constantly traveling between locations. I also personally admire the nuclear bomb riding scene and the ending, in which fun is poked at a true catastrophe as a dark comedy. The only small problem I have with the movie is the name. Dr. Strangelove doesn't play a big role in the movie, although the name draws attention to him. I think ""How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" is a better name."
174,dr_strangelove,audience,5.0,p,"No need to add accolades to what I, having lived through the under-the-desk drills of the '50's, consider the best comedy of my life for making people laugh while being terrifyingly aware of the real nuclear threat. (The U.S. and the Soviets went frighteningly nose to nose over ballistic missiles in Cube only two years earlier with nuclear war hanging in the balance for days.)

My only comment: Sterling Hayden, playing Brig.Gen. Jack D. Ripper, not even in the cast list??? Even Tracy Reed, Miss Scott for maybe 10 minutes, is listed. His character was the linchpin of the plot! For half a century, when the film name was mentioned, the one defining image that always flashes in my mind is not Peter Sellers or George C. Scott. It's Ripper, extreme close up from below, puffing on his fat cigar and uttering mad nonsense about fluoridation (another wacky issue of that era) and precious bodily fluids with deathly conviction. 

He was nominated for an Academy Award as best foreign actor—more credit than Reed earned. For heaven's sake, it's not too late. Add him to the list. Now!"
175,dr_strangelove,audience,4.5,p,"Unlike most older films, especially ones in black & white, I had seen this before.  The satire and irony is off the charts.  It's truly amazing that despite being in black & white and revolving around character types that are usually straight-faced and boring, that this is still an entertaining film that is hard to look away from.... and that is my thinking on this BEFORE Doctor Strangelove even speaks.  It's not my place to dissect and know every word of this from start to finish, it is before my time, so I'll leave it as is.... but as far as names go, it doesn't get much more humorous than Col .""Bat"" Guano"
176,dr_strangelove,audience,5.0,p,"An undying masterpiece, specially if you check the news in freaking 2021. Kubrick and Sellers put at the top of their game and deliver one of the best histories about the end of the world by the hand of the human race"
177,dr_strangelove,audience,4.5,p,"Very clever and intensely gripping. Great political commentary that still holds true to this day. I wasn't expecting such a tense movie, but we enjoyed it very much. Recommended"
178,dr_strangelove,audience,3.0,p,"Yes, I know this is a classic black humor flick, but it has places that drag while other aspects were too quickly done.  Still, enjoyed the satire of war, ""the bomb,"" and military men."
179,dr_strangelove,audience,4.5,p,"If anyone can keep you intrigued with a meeting full of political men taking place in the War Room for the remaining runtime of trying to figure out the code and stopping a nuclear war with a damn well-crafted screenplay filled with hilarious spoof humor (the dialogue between US President and Russian President filled with more ""sorry's"" than any human has ever said in their life), Kubrick is your guy.

Memorable quotes/scenic shots (filled with paradoxes and sarcasm)
- ""Men! You can't fight in here. It's the war room!""
- soldiers shooting at war with a ""Peace is our profession sign"" in the background
- the 3 word recall code potentially being ""purity of essence"" or ""peace on earth"""

189,harold_and_kumar_go_to_white_castle,critics,fresh,p,An over-the-top romp which rehashes lots of dumb drug jokes but breaks far enough away from the tried-and-true teen formula to earn a high mark even from this jaded critic.

200,harold_and_kumar_go_to_white_castle,audience,3.5,p,"John Cho and Kal Penn prove to have great comedic chemistry as Harold and Kumar, respectively, in Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle.  Granted, it has its share of comic duds (the hang glider flight and the cheetah ride, to name a couple) that are silly and unnecessary, but there are enough genuine laughs to compensate for the weak points.  As added bonuses, Neil Patrick Harris plays himself to hilarious effect and the movie also touches on issues concerning racism throughout, a nice touch considering the nature of the film.  Oh, yeah…and what great publicity for White Castle - it is advertising genius."

While some of the humor is what many would call ""low brow"" - many who can see past this know this is a classic film - that will stand the test of time.

208,harold_and_kumar_go_to_white_castle,audience,3.0,p,"It's smart, well written, and has some great moments. But it just isn't as memorable as people say."
209,harold_and_kumar_go_to_white_castle,audience,4.0,p,"Harold & Kumar is an interesting franchise, as it implements a rather unique notion:  Low-brow humor written by smart people, with some of the jokes being complicated enough to require genuine degrees of intellect on the viewer's part.  Considering the quantity of stoner humor, innuendo and occasional bathroom humor, this movie is a good example of deceptive intelligence, making it much more akin to movies like Waynes World or Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, rather than something like A Haunted House 2 or Epic Movie/Disaster Movie.
The main reason for this is that the main characters are both highly intelligent people, simply choosing to let themselves periodically operate on base-level.  One is a mid-tier accountant at a financial firm (someone so good that his pushy co-workers push their work onto him), and the other just one exam away from qualifying as a legitimate surgeon.  However, both love their weed, and this ENTIRE movie is about them on a journey to find a particular meal they want, making this literally the only Comedy in history where the central conflict/objective is literally all about being hungry.  These two guys were high, saw a White Castle commercial, and then go on a (very wild and unexpectedly dangerous) journey to find one of these fast-food restaurants.
One additional element is that this movie also features various parties that are aggressive and abusive toward Harold and/or Kumar, as well as a Shy-Love story, and all of these are actually wrapped up in very satisfying ways - all bad people meet (sometimes severe) comeuppance and all the good people are as good as before if not better, and oh - yeah, Harold & Kumar DO make it to White Castle and love their meal!  It's easy-going, it's high-energy, competently shot/edited and the two lead actors actually do a great job, so if you're a fan of juvenile humor but also appreciate intellectual humor, I strongly recommend this one, as well as its (admittedly uneven) sequels."
0,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"It's the greatest comedy - and funniest movie - of all time. ... But, as with most of Chaplin's other films, it'll also make you cry your eyes out."
1,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Several high spots stand out as notable examples of Chaplin's expert timing of slapstick burlesque, scenes that are apt to make the spectator shed tears from the strain of laughter."
2,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"The sequence in which the modern mechanical feeder for workers is introduced is a gem of comedy invention. It is one of the funniest episodes, and certainly the most ingenious."
3,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,There are reminders of every Chaplin picture that was ever made all through Modern Times and there are enough brand new comic inventions to explain why Charlie takes such a long time between pictures and why they are so superlatively worth waiting for.
4,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"What most amazes you about Modern Times, is the fact that, in this day of superfine sound films, it says everything without saying anything."
5,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"In many ways Modern Times is old-fashioned film comedy, but it is the kind of comedy which has made millions of people laugh all over the world and which has won Mr. Chaplin the great affection and love."
6,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"While he has borrowed a few symbolic touches from the Russian picture makers, there is nothing of real significance in Chaplin s work except his earnest desire, and his really great ability, to entertain."
7,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Modern Times, underneath its farce, is a curiously passionate jibe at the herd-instincts and herd clangour of a machine age."
8,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"The monotony of this Job ""gets"" Charlie and he runs wild, attacking everything and everybody in view with his brandished wrenches in one of the funniest scenes ever filmed."
9,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Miss Goddard put us in mind more of a ballet dancer in portraying her role than a screen player, which fits in, on the whole, rather well with Chaplin's style. She's attractive and has charm."
10,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"It is episodically hilarious but never consistently so, and you come away from the Penn remembering, not so much the heroic Chaplinesque figure as a nut-and-bolt factory, a red flag, a feeding machine and a song."
11,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"It doesn't seem possible to inject a large quantity of heart appeal in a heavily gagged-up comedy but Chaplin does it. That's Chaplin's forte, and that's what distinguishes his comedies from all others."
12,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,Chaplin exhibits his amazing versatility in the fast-forgotten art of pantomime and makes you laugh when you had perhaps expected to cry.
13,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Remaining silent, Charlie is more eloquent in pantomime than many other comedians are with the added use of spoken words. Poking gentle fun at mechanized industry, Charlie is comic indeed."
14,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Five years absence from the screen has not diminished Chaplin's art. In his usual fashion, he can provoke laughs or tears, and keep the audience absorbed in whatever he is doing."
15,modern_times,critics,rotten,n,"What begins as a rather heavy lampooning gets lost in a series of first-rate slapstick acts and ends up as an idyll. Modern Tunes is, of course, funny picture; it Is also a very disappointing one."
16,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Chaplin [has] returned to basic fundamentals in story construction, coupling with it an ironic poke or two at the System, as constituted today, and combined with that his great talent in his first screen appearance since City Lights."
17,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,There are many sequences which will become famous. The philosophy is evident. It is clear that Chaplin's answer to modern times is that if the individual does not conform he is taken away in a van to prison or to hospital.
18,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"The full revelation of [Paulette Goddard] is not to be detected in this production, but there is unusual promise in her work -- perhaps more than in the instance of any other Chaplin leading woman."

22,modern_times,audience,2.5,n,"I mean its typical Chaplin. I find his humor mostly predictable and the original annoying steve urkel. He is not really my cup of tea. In this day and age, I prefer more intellect with my humor, although this keeps you somewhat entertained. I liked seeing how the old department stores were organized and how police used to wander the streets. I also liked seeing the inappropriate coke scene and when they talk about ""darkies"" this people back in the day had no chill. Cant believe this is what people looked forward to for entertainment, the bar was not very high. This wasn't his best film I'm afraid and I don't like slapstick to begin with."
23,modern_times,audience,5.0,p,Chaplin Brings his slapstick comedy Genius to his Timeless as his beloved Character The Tramp and goes from Working in a factory to jail then to a waiter and the along the way the results are every time hilarious results in this Slient pre code masterpiece from one of the masters filmmakers of all time
24,modern_times,audience,4.0,p,"Class on precarious jobs and how to face it, more valid today than 85 years ago."
25,modern_times,audience,2.5,n,"I think it's safe to say that I'm just not a big fan of Charlie Chaplin. As of writing this review, I've seen The Great Dictator, City Lights and, earlier today, Modern Times. The latter is a noted criticism of industrialisation and its effect on humanity, but most of the film is, unsurprisingly, The Tramp spending long stretches of time falling over, bumping into things and being so gosh darned loveable that you just wanna pick him up and take him home. It felt like the least funny and least substantial of the 3 films, with a scattershot plot and sporadic social commentary. This might have been intentional, as this was to be The Tramp's final cinematic outing, and Chaplin wanted him to go out doing what he had become famous for. It does end on an organically positive note, and if Chaplin's style of comedy appeals to you, then Modern Times should be on your watchlist. But I wasn't won over by its message or its content."
26,modern_times,audience,5.0,p,I love Modern Times so much I came back for the second showing! See my earlier post.
27,modern_times,audience,5.0,p,"Charlie is mesmerizing. Modern Times is one of my favorite films. Its funny and poignant, a timeless classic as relevant today as it always was. This was the Little Tramps last appearance and Charlies last silent film. There is some dialogue as well as sound effects and a brilliant score but Charlie himself doesnt speak. We do hear his voice, however, at the end!"
28,modern_times,audience,5.0,p,Charlie Chapman's talents mesmerize.
29,modern_times,audience,4.5,p,"Modern Times is unexpectedly hilarous. Somehow the 30s humor still works. The story is related in a very good way, and the mix between sound and silence is just incredible.
Modern Times is one of the most important films in history, uniting silent and sound movies, but more important, it is a really good film."
30,moonstruck,critics,fresh,p,One of the most perfect romantic comedies there is. Cinematic chicken soup for the soul.
31,moonstruck,critics,fresh,p,"While it leans a bit too heavily on the whimsy, Moonstruck is nevertheless a winning romantic comedy."
32,moonstruck,critics,fresh,p,"With a sharply-written, Oscar-winning screenplay populated with compelling characters and an outstanding ensemble, Moonstruck goes beyond the typical rom-com trappings to deliver something a little more substantial than your standard entries in the genre."
33,moonstruck,critics,fresh,p,"Moonstruck is regarded as one of the great romantic comedies of all time, but mio dio, it's truly the antidote to bad vibes."
34,moonstruck,critics,fresh,p,"This uproarious exercise in accidental relationships, unveiled adultery, and coincidental prosperity is a grand romantic comedy that shouldn't be missed."
35,moonstruck,critics,fresh,p,It's wonderfully written and has just the right touch of sweeping romance that you need.
36,moonstruck,critics,fresh,p,"The movie is pleasant, full of charm, entertaining, subtle, at times complicated, but always easy to follow. [Full Review in Spanish]"
37,moonstruck,critics,fresh,p,"Hinging on the lead performance of Cher - who won one of the three Oscars awarded to the film - it benefits from its very specific New York setting, its consistent sense of humor and its deep sense of romantic realism."
38,moonstruck,critics,fresh,p,"Moonstruck is one of those movies you watch and say, ""they don't make them like that anymore."" However, it's more than just a few laughs and iconic line readings. Its tight story structure and Cher's magnetic performance is hard to not get swept up in."
39,moonstruck,critics,fresh,p,I love Cher in this and her chemistry with Nicholas Cage is off the charts.
40,moonstruck,critics,fresh,p,"Here, at last, is the kind of warm adult comedy that often eludes Hollywood an offbeat exploration of family, fidelity and the foibles of the human heart."
41,moonstruck,critics,fresh,p,Best performance ever by a musician transitioning from recording studio to silver screen? The incomparable Cher would have to go close here.
42,moonstruck,critics,fresh,p,"At times funny and clever, Moonstruck asks the questions: what does it mean to be in love? and is it ever okay to settle?"
43,moonstruck,critics,fresh,p,"Jewison's point seems to be that love may not be perfect, but it can be sweet fun."
44,moonstruck,critics,fresh,p,"This is a movie that makes you want to sing ""Boheme"" and walk in the moonlight and move to Brooklyn."
45,moonstruck,critics,fresh,p,You will not easily forget this incredibly robust family.
46,moonstruck,critics,fresh,p,"An American movie with foreign-film sensibilities, Moonstruck's depths come from their perfect balance of writing and direction."
47,moonstruck,critics,fresh,p,"Cher is simply wonderful, and the teaming with Cage an inspiration. The rest of the cast couldn't be better."
48,moonstruck,critics,fresh,p,It isn't great art -- it`s too closely concentrated on immediate emotional effect for that -- but it is highly sophisticated craftsmanship.
49,moonstruck,critics,rotten,n,"No resistance could overcome the overfamiliarity of the situations in Moonstruck, the corniness of its dramaturgy or the banality of its message."
50,moonstruck,audience,3.5,p,"I have seen all the ads, but never saw this movie until now, wondering if it was worth the hype. Yes and no.

Cher plays a young widowed bookkeeper living with her stereotypical quirky Italian extended family, when an ethnic Sicilian man who was a friend of her late husband proposes to her and she accepts, not really loving him but wanting a husband. But the man has to visit Sicily to visit his dying mother, and he wants to reconcile with his estranged brother, so he has Cher do the job. Trouble is, when Cher visits the brother, he wants her for himself...

This is a romantic comedy, not just involving Cher but other family members and people they know, and we wonder how everything is going to turn out. The ending is a decent surprise at least."
51,moonstruck,audience,4.0,p,Cher won an academy award for this movie thus the four star rating!!!!
52,moonstruck,audience,3.5,p,"It's essentially an ode to the family and to the family values, as shown by an Italian American family. Nothing is perfect, but in the end we are family. Family and to a certain extent love prevail, but neither one of those ( family and love) is perfect or painless.  A somewhat flat message that will likely feel stronger to some than to others, but not much to process once the movie it's over.  The overall movie is relatable and believable, particularly because it makes use of varied stereotypical ideas of Italian Americans in New York City. Whether those are true, that's a different story. Full of nice and seamless performances by veteran actors and by some then upcoming actors. Some inconsistencies in the accents, as it'd be expected... Overall, worthwhile the time."
53,moonstruck,audience,4.0,p,"Led by an excellent set of perfomances by Nicolas Cage and Cher 'Moonstruck' is a sweet, funny and energetic romantic comedy that endures the test of time. (8/10)"
54,moonstruck,audience,5.0,p,The best rom com ever!
55,moonstruck,audience,5.0,p,"I generally loath rom-coms and their predictable format. I saw Moonstruck when it was first released and return to it whenever I want to smile. A little exploration of the human condition. A great cast, beautifully written and perfectly paced. Certainly Cher's best movie outing and you can't go far wrong with Norman Jewison."
56,moonstruck,audience,2.0,n,"Moonstruck shines fairly brightly as one of the few tolerable films with music stars in lead roles (Cast Away, anyone?) but comes unstuck due to nonsensical symbolism and an overly ambitious array of other narrative choices that lack cohesion. At every turn, Moonstruck attempts to declare some profound, undying truth about love through one of its characters, but fails to ascend above a pulpy, crowd-pleasing mess. While the humourous elements successfully break up the main plotlines with a distinct and unique Italian-American flavour not often replicated so well in Hollywood, it can only cover up so many problems. Cher does well, which is to say that she manages to seem competent when compared to Nicholas Cage. I enjoy much of Cage's work, but his role seemed caught in an unhappy and practically nonexistent plane of existence between the comic relief and serious object of desire and love interest. Olympia Dukakis won an Oscar, but her moments in the spotlight were undermined by more of the confusing themes exhibited throughout much of the rest of the film. Moonstruck is a mixed bag with many problematic areas of the script seeming outdated today, such as a constant distinction in love between men and women in terms of generalisations in behavior. Yes, the performances are sometimes absorbing, but the source material too flawed to provide a film to be enjoyed."
57,moonstruck,audience,5.0,p,"One of my favorite movies of all time. Every line, every scene is perfect. No wasted scenes. I laugh out loud at many scenes, cry from joy at others. I've seen it about 6 times. Cher is stunning. Nicholas Cage is moody and sexy. Everyone is perfect in their roles. Olympia - the best matriarch. It just seems like the best Italian family."
58,moonstruck,audience,3.0,p,easy to watch but I thought the storyline was weak and no chemistry between Cher & Cage - you cannot make a good movie just because it is little italy
59,moonstruck,audience,3.0,p,"""You love him, Loretta?""
""Ma, I love him awful.""
""Ah, that's too bad.""

A romcom with a decent sense of humor and a willingness to present its relationships as realistically (often endearingly) flawed, but not really that functional when it comes to the whimsy or whirlwind nature to balance it all out. Cher and Cage don't really seem like they share any particular chemistry, and Cage's Ronny gets over the manic depression that supposedly defines his character almost ludicrously quickly, leaving behind only a few manic quips to remind you that he was supposed to be  a massively flawed character. Trying to impart darker themes focusing on decaying relationships, age, and the ups and downs of irrational love, not much of that lands compared to the well-designed family dynamics and jokes told through heavy Italian and New York accents. Still a fun movie, but a top all-time rom-com? Not for me. (3/5)"
60,beverly_hills_cop,critics,fresh,p,It's a good detective story. It's got a great bad guy. It's got a motivated hero... it's a fun movie that moves... and doesn't stop.
61,beverly_hills_cop,critics,fresh,p,Murphy is a one-man show backed up by his supporting cast - especially Reinhold and Ashton - who allow Murphy the freedom to do what he does best.
62,beverly_hills_cop,critics,fresh,p,"Although Murphy is a one-man-army comedian, the chemistry between Foley, Rosewood, and Taggart truly makes the movie hilarious."
63,beverly_hills_cop,critics,fresh,p,Pretty funny after all these years. The position of Murphy as an emerging star feels very genuine. [Full review in Spanish].
64,beverly_hills_cop,critics,fresh,p,...a work of racial subversion that's both hilarious and cathartic.
65,beverly_hills_cop,critics,fresh,p,The vastly entertaining Beverly Hills Cop remains noteworthy as the film that best makes use of Eddie Murphy's explosive comic instincts.
66,beverly_hills_cop,critics,fresh,p,An exceptional entry in the '80s comedy/action genre...
67,beverly_hills_cop,critics,rotten,n,It has a creamy surface and junky insides.
68,beverly_hills_cop,critics,rotten,n,"Away from Murphy's iconic comic status and star quality at the time, he was a limited dramatic actor - making almost untenable the tauter moments of the plot."
69,beverly_hills_cop,critics,fresh,p,(PODCAST) Eddie Murphy's Axel Foley is a gay cop out to solve the murder of an ex-lover. 20 years of hindsight shows Axel Foley to be a great gay icon of '80s pop culture.
70,beverly_hills_cop,critics,fresh,p,"This lickety-split action comedy is distinguished by the wry, character-conscious direction of Martin Brest, who coaxes a silver-bullet performance from star Eddie Murphy that's practically criminal in its accuracy."
71,beverly_hills_cop,critics,fresh,p,By no means great cinema... but it is a great popcorn movie.
72,beverly_hills_cop,critics,fresh,p,"Fast, enjoyable, often witty action-comedy that made Eddie Muprphy the most popular movie star in the country."
73,beverly_hills_cop,critics,fresh,p,"Simply put, Beverly Hills Cop is one of the best buddy cop movies ever made."
74,beverly_hills_cop,critics,rotten,n,begin charting the legendarily-steep decline of Murphy as a conversation worth having outside the tabloids.
75,beverly_hills_cop,critics,fresh,p,
76,beverly_hills_cop,critics,fresh,p,Classic '80s Murphy vehicle; fun but foulmouthed.
77,beverly_hills_cop,critics,fresh,p,"Murphy exudes the kind of cheeky, cocky charm that has been missing from the screen since Cagney was a pup, snarling his way out of the ghetto."
78,beverly_hills_cop,critics,fresh,p,
79,beverly_hills_cop,critics,fresh,p,See website for more details.
80,beverly_hills_cop,audience,5.0,p,"An excellent action comedy film with Eddie Murphy at his best. Even if you aren't familiar with the films, the iconic theme song provided by Harold Faltermeyer is instantly recognizable whenever you hear it."
81,beverly_hills_cop,audience,3.0,p,"""Somebody's gonne lose their job for this. This guy gave me a match, for Christ's sake. Listen to me, I do security checks all over the nation, and with the exception of Cleveland, this place has the worst security in the nation."" I hope you like hearing Eddie Murphy's laugh, because he rolls it out just about every three and a half minutes, by my estimate.

A pretty typical '80s buddy cop action-comedy with one bumping theme and some fun delivery from Murphy, Beverly Hills Cop basically ignores its actual plot for most of the film's first half in favor of hijinks, but it's not like there's any sort of mystery as to what's going to happen. But we're not here for perennial villain Steven Berkoff masquerade as an art dealer, it's all about the mischief and jokes; to that end, the film's best feature is the chemistry between Murphy and the straight man duo of John Ashton and particularly Judge Reinhold, whose bumbling Boy Scout persona is a great complement to Murphy's reckless hotshot. A lot of the story is as threadbare as can be and several characters are there only for the tropes or as token characters (Eilbacher's Jenny might have been added in post-production after some executive realized there were no female roles in the script for all we know), some of the jokes are dated, and it's certainly not the most action-heavy of its genre. But the movie is still pretty fun all in all, with uppity lieutenants trying to go by the book, accent-tinged villains (including a young Jonathan Banks), and quips galore.

Axel F might unironically be the most successful theme indpendent of its original movie of the entire decade, it's still recognizable today. (3/5)"
82,beverly_hills_cop,audience,4.5,p,"This movie has guns, cars, and Eddie Murphy. This is great. Not to mention the soundtrack bangs."
83,beverly_hills_cop,audience,5.0,p,Fun and action since min 1. Great movie.
84,beverly_hills_cop,audience,4.0,p,"Classic 80's cop movie (can you call 80's films classics? Um, I spose you can) with comic undertones and a young Eddie Murphy who was at the top of his game, fresh off of the success of '48 hrs.' and 'Trading Places'. This type of stuff was perfect for a 1980's Murphy and he leads the charge here brilliantly, with jokes that land but are never over the top or cringy in a story that suffices well enough. Although 'Beverly Hills Cop' will probably play better to people who remember it as a video treat 30 odd years ago, it's well worth checking out if you weren't around then or never saw it before. Easily one of the best films of its type."
85,beverly_hills_cop,audience,3.5,p,Still holds up in 2021 3.4
86,beverly_hills_cop,audience,5.0,p,"Ever seen a perfect Hollywood film? This is extremely close to being that. The soundtrack, Eddie Murphy owning the stage, the antics. This is one of those cool movies that people who like Pulp Fiction would enjoy."
87,beverly_hills_cop,audience,4.0,p,Eddie Murphy's performance shines and guides Beverly Hills Cop to be a more fun and exciting than the regular buddy-cop movie.
88,beverly_hills_cop,audience,5.0,p,"This movie has it all.

Wit, charm and intrepidity, all rolled in one."
89,beverly_hills_cop,audience,5.0,p,"""French Kiss""!  (not nearly as bad as herpes simplex ten) I love love love Eddie Murphy  in this movie. Perfection."
90,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,critics,rotten,n,The script by Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon is more clever in the small details than in the broad strokes.
91,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,critics,fresh,p,Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is tons of fun because it's sense of ridiculousness never goes too far as to be absurd (a crime of which its sequel is guilty).
92,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,critics,fresh,p,"It's hard not to love unaccomplished would-be heroes who prove to be amazingly resourceful when under the gun, and their timeless little movie is defiantly fun and precious as a result."
93,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,critics,fresh,p,It's more charming than funny but with all their dumb antics Bill and Ted are quite charming
94,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,critics,fresh,p,"A total joy. Bill and Ted are so cartoonish, when they have a bright idea I half-expect to see fizzing lightbulbs on their heads. But their relationship is touching and very human, and it turns out we were all pronouncing Socrates wrong."
95,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,critics,fresh,p,Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is absolutely absurd and still funny as hell. Reeves and Winters have remarkable chemistry together.
96,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,critics,fresh,p,"A spectacularly stoo-pid slacker comedy that actually gets better as it goes along, if only because the ungainly chemistry of the two leads really does grow on you."
97,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,critics,fresh,p,"It's an inspired bit of silliness, and one of the best of its kind."
98,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,critics,fresh,p,"Thankfully, the sense of humor still holds and the lead characters are as sweet and dumb as ever. They mean well, they just don't have follow through--and we've all known that person."
99,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,critics,fresh,p,"... this is a spirited doofus comedy sustained by the sweet, slack-jawed performances of Reeves and Winter as dumbfounded idiots who stumble through time to cram for their history final ..."
100,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,critics,fresh,p,It dodges the pitfalls of message-heavy teen movies and skirts the spite of the dumb-and-dumber era it arguably helped birth. Add two innately loveable leads and you can see it takes some smarts to sell something quite this daft.
101,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,critics,fresh,p,"What really makes it all work are Reeves and Winter. They're such appealing, wide-eyed idiots that it's impossible not to pull for them. They make a great team."
102,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,critics,fresh,p,A totally excellent film.
103,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,critics,rotten,n,"Though its one-liners elicit the occasional chortle -- when Bill and Ted don medieval armor, there's an obligatory heavy-metal joke -- the film doesn't engage, because its heroes don't engage with the historical characters."
104,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,critics,rotten,n,"Make no mistake, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is not a satire of mindlessness; it's unabashed glorification of dumbness for dumbness' sake."
105,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,critics,fresh,p,"A nonstop giggle from start to finish, this beguiling grab-bag of time-travel clichs, hard-rock music and Valley-speaking cool dudes is a flawless, purpose-built junk movie."
106,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,critics,fresh,p,still relateable today
107,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,critics,rotten,n,The humor is light (and light-headed)-so much so that you'd have to say it's a stoner movie with no pot.
108,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,critics,fresh,p,'Be excellent to each other.' Out of the mouths of babehounds... [Blu-ray]
109,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,critics,fresh,p,Silly time-capsule comedy ideal for older tweens.
110,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,audience,5.0,p,Alex winter and Keanu reeves truly amazing me by their ability to create chemistry as these two valley boys. Start to finish its engaging and entertaining with a mixture of comedy and whatever else bill and Ted try's to be lol it's a very unique film!
111,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,audience,3.5,p,Ok film liked the lead characters.  Did laugh a few times .
112,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,audience,1.0,n,"Oof, this movie did not age at all well. It plays like a bad PBS educational film."
113,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,audience,3.5,p,Years later it still holds up. It's funny. The time travel bits are really smart. The central relationship between Bill and Ted is so sweet and pure.
114,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,audience,2.5,n,"The story wasn't really engaging but the few aspects which were engaging were enjoyable like the seemingly legendary status both Bill & Ted were able to achieve in the future and how each & every idiotic thing they said & did were hailed by everyone in the future. Bill's family dynamic was hilarious. And the end was Ok. But the time-traveling events were just boring & weren't written very well though the historical figures were a riot when they were brought to the present timeline. All and all it was Meh, either good or bad."
115,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,audience,5.0,p,This movie is great! Great plot! And great actors too! I love this movie!
116,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,audience,4.0,p,"While it seems like a flop on paper, Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter's lovable goofball demeanors make this Dumb and Dumber/Back to the Future mashup a beloved favorite for millions."
117,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,audience,5.0,p,"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is a fun and silly movie, but that's not why it's remembered.  It's also notably more creative and intricate than one would initially think, and features some great performances, VFX (particularly for 1989) and a great soundtrack.  But what really does it is that this movie has an intense sense of optimism:  It's one of the very few effective comedies that is both very entertaining and very positive in its worldview.  Bill & Ted are not only the POV characters, they are also the beating-heart of the movie, and that's big because this movie has a lot of heart within it.  It's endearing and makes you happy, having almost none of its humor coming from mockery but rather from the thoughts and actions of some dim-witted but very well-natured individuals.  I watched this in the theater when I was 7 and loved it then, and having just watched it again at 39, I am even more appreciative for how perfect much of this movie is -- Like a modern movie, its Themes are front-and-center, but it also tells enough of a competent Sci-Fi story and features great characters, and that is why it works so well.  The story of two musicians needing to be saved from separation because one day their music will unite all of humanity and end interpersonal conflict is silly, but the movie treats it as seriously as a movie like this can, culminating in a surprisingly powerful scene where Bill & Ted enter the future, where, in a nearly completely wordless scene, the future leaders sit in front of them in sheer reverence of them, as people come out and, in unison, give them the Guitar hand-motion in a way that feels less like someone partying, but someone doing so to show a genuine sign of gratitude and respect.  In no other movie could a scene like this exist, nor could such a satisfying film exist without so much as a legitimate villain.  It's sweet, it's smart and it's hopeful looking forward, and upon reflection, this movie has meant quite a lot to me through the years."
118,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,audience,4.0,p,While it's a little slow and cringy at times it is indeed an excellent adventure.
119,bill_and_teds_excellent_adventure,audience,4.0,p,This movie is so fucking funny!
120,dazed_and_confused,critics,fresh,p,"The magnum opus of Linklater's Austin films, but in this slice of life it's high schoolers moving up and moving on."
121,dazed_and_confused,critics,fresh,p,It's never going to be this good again.
122,dazed_and_confused,critics,fresh,p,"Totally authentic. Every time you watch this film, you're taken back to the 1970s daze of high school. The '70s kids AMERICAN GRAFFITI."
123,dazed_and_confused,critics,fresh,p,"Richard Linklater manages to entertain with a film that's really about nothing, yet truly works as a snapshot of a certain moment in time. [Full review in Spanish]"
124,dazed_and_confused,critics,fresh,p,"Few of these people are going anywhere, but they are not going anywhere with style and dignity."
125,dazed_and_confused,critics,fresh,p,"It is a nostalgia film and a coming-of-age film. In some ways, it is every Bildungsroman and in some ways, it is like no other."
126,dazed_and_confused,critics,fresh,p,Very little actually happens but - like life - it's not always the events that define a time but the characters in it. And ''Dazed and Confused'' is bursting with wonderfully drawn and completely credible characters.
127,dazed_and_confused,critics,rotten,n,Watching this documentary-style picture is like being clean and sober at some endless '70s party where everyone else is drunk or stoned.
128,dazed_and_confused,critics,fresh,p,"Richard Linklater's cinematic flashback Dazed and Confused captures a rich pageant of high-school life, circa 1976, in a mere 100 minutes, leaning on nostalgia without wallowing in it."
129,dazed_and_confused,critics,fresh,p,"Manages to not only unfold in to a fun narrative, but also builds a myriad fascinating characters you'll either love or hate..."
130,dazed_and_confused,critics,rotten,n,glorifies bullying and tries to balance it with pseudo-intellectual contemplation
131,dazed_and_confused,critics,rotten,n,"Has the look and spirit of the time down pat. Unfortunately it captures only the worst of the typical misogynistic, foul mouthed druggie losers of the period."
132,dazed_and_confused,critics,fresh,p,"The film transcends the common barriers and becomes a living spiritual entity, encompassing the essence and tone of an era."
133,dazed_and_confused,critics,fresh,p,"It may have seemed like a movie that was out of time, but it turned out to be perfectly in sync with the restlessness of the early 90s as well."
134,dazed_and_confused,critics,fresh,p,"Like the moustache sported by Matthew McCounaughey's character, Dazed And Confused is sleazy, amusing and quite, quite awesome."
135,dazed_and_confused,critics,fresh,p,"The teenage wasteland, 1976-style, of Dazed and Confused is smack-dab between The Brady Bunch and Children of the Damned , and it's a scary, if sometimes giddily amusing, place to visit."
136,dazed_and_confused,critics,fresh,p,Bet it makes you wanna dance.
137,dazed_and_confused,critics,fresh,p,"Despite some gags which use the benefit of hindsight too much for their own good, this is a smart piece of filmmaking which suggests Linklater is already one of the more formidable talents of the 90s."
138,dazed_and_confused,critics,fresh,p,Plenty of drug use with very little consequence.
139,dazed_and_confused,critics,fresh,p,"Seriously funny, and shorn of any hint of nostalgia or wish-fulfilment, this is pretty much where it's at."
140,dazed_and_confused,audience,4.0,p,"A word of warning to those who insist on movies having a complex plot and some semblance of character development: don't watch Dazed and Confused.  The film is one of Richard Linklater's ‘slice of life' films, a keen observation of what it was like being a teenager in the ‘70s.  Having been a teen during the period, the movie is a remarkably accurate reflection of the era – booze, smokes, weed, tight jeans and great rock and roll.  While hazing was certainly a thing with freshmen, it didn't exist to the level shown in the movie, but that's a minor quibble.  Filled with future stars, the cast is fantastic, the acting is great, the soundtrack is amazing, and the film will most surely stir the memory of anyone who lived through the period and confirm that those years were the best years of our lives.  It's a shame we didn't know it at the time."
141,dazed_and_confused,audience,4.0,p,"The story is a mess, though ""Dazed and Confused"" helms strong performances and great fun that block out the muddled and all-over-the-place story. A great film that is led by its strong performances and the fun that the actors seem to be having. It also does a great job capturing the 70s due to its fantastic costume design and props. Overall, an enjoyable film that is loads of fun."
142,dazed_and_confused,audience,5.0,p,"Richard Linklater's cult classic still holds up today. I've watched this movie so many times back when it first came out, I've admittedly lost perspective on it to a degree. It played locally as a midnight movie for over a year and if there was ever a Friday or Saturday night with nothing going on, we'd walk down to The Bijou and watch ""Dazed and Confused"" one more time. Easily dismissed as a stoner comedy, I'd argue that it's five star masterpiece of American cinema. The film is deceptively simple. The plot, if you can call it that, revolves around a group of 1976 Texas teenagers on the last day of school. This thin plot is a step up for Linklater, who's prior film ""Slacker"" was even thinner, simply a day in the life of Austin, Texas where the camera follows one character to the next character and then to the next and so on and so forth for 90 minutes. For Dazed, our window into this world of 70's Texas teen life is freshman Mitch Kramer, played wonderfully by Wiley Wiggins who I'm surprised didn't go on to many more films, finding himself invited out by the cool seniors. Linklater assembled a pretty amazing cast of before-they-were-famous actors that includes Ben Affleck, Matthew McConaughey, Joey Lauren Adams, Rory Cochrane, Adam Goldberg, Anthony Rapp, Cole Hauser, Parker Posey, Nicky Katt, and Renée Zellweger (as ""girl in blue truck""). The only actors who were sort of famous were Jason London and Milla Jovovich. Quentin Tarantino included ""Dazed and Confused"" on his list of the 10 greatest films of all time in the 2002 Sight and Sound poll, which surveys critics and filmmakers every 10 years. He's said of ""Dazed and Confused"" that: 

""There are certain movies that you hang out with the characters so much that they actually become your friends. And that's a really rare quality to have in a film… and those movies are usually quite long, because it actually takes that long of a time to get past a movie character where you actually feel that you know the person and you like them…when it's over, they're your friends.""

And that sums up a major element of why I love this film, that it so easily drawn you into it's world. Additionally, and on a personal level, I found the film immediately identifiable. Although my high school experience was in the late 80s, I feel like just about everything that happens in this film was something from my own high school experience, though I never had a night quite like this one where so much happened all at one time, but I do think most everything depicted in the film has a real-life analogue to my time middle and high school. That nostalgia factor plays heavily into my love of this film, but regardless of those personal connections, you have to admire the how such a seemingly aimless stoner comedy so neatly weaves together into a breezy carefree and yet coherent film. ""Dazed and Confused"" really should have gotten an Oscar for editing for how it stitches together such seemingly freeform, unconnected scenes into a coherent piece of storytelling. Overall, this film is an incredibly charming piece of nostalgia that connects with me on a personal level, but I believe will also connect with audiences across generations. A classic and an absolute MUST SEE!

FUN FACT! Reportedly one-sixth of the budget was spent on acquiring the rights to 1970s pop hits for the film's stellar soundtrack."
143,dazed_and_confused,audience,2.0,n,"In 2021, this movie did not age especially well. At least not where I live."
144,dazed_and_confused,audience,4.5,p,"It's so fun to watch, it's about some dumb teenagers and the stupid shit they do. I really recommend it if you don't looking for something deep."
145,dazed_and_confused,audience,3.5,p,"I somehow managed to watch hundreds and hundreds of movies without seeing a single plotless slice-of-life movie until I decided to watch Fast Times; I've seen a few now, and while this one is an obvious standout I must say this genre is not my cup of tea. I thought the dedication to hazing in the first half of the movie was excessive and overdone, though I get that it served its purpose in Affleck's character arc. I liked most of the rest, especially the soundtrack and McConaughey's performance."
146,dazed_and_confused,audience,4.0,p,"There a special kind of sweetness to this movie that can only be explained by watching it, i can watch this one all day"
147,dazed_and_confused,audience,1.5,n,"Didn't make it to the 23 minute mark.  Couldn't get into seniors hazing 8th graders- seemed thuggish, not funny.  No interesting or appealing characters introduced in the time I watched.  I'm surprised at all the good reviews.  I had heard of it for a long time, but never watched it because I figured it would just be about dumb stoners, but it was even worse.  I really like the song of the same title by Led Zeppelin, but there is no relation between the two."
148,dazed_and_confused,audience,3.5,p,"One of the most famous coming of age films to emerge from the 80s, and one of the biggest not to be directed by John Hughes, Dazed & Confused builds its appeal on the strength of its characters and how they interact. There isn't really a central story, instead there's a series of individual narratives that occasionally intersect, and that's where the most entertaining parts of the movie can be found. Some are more interesting than others of course. The stuff with the bullies quickly wears out its welcome, and the film drops it abruptly about midway through. The scenes involving a fresh-faced Matthew McConaughey are often referred to as the best in the movie, and I can see why. It's an effortlessly likeable and infinitely quotable performance, and the one that will likely stay with you after you finished watching. From a purely emotional standpoint, I guess the parts with Cynthia's crew and young Mitch are the most engaging, since they feel like the most relatable characters. We all knew people like them growing up, and if you didn't, then you were them. Its appeal seems mostly rooted in how well it captured the spirit of the time period, the frequent laughs and the awesome soundtrack, and while I won't say its one of my favourites, I can understand why it struck a chord with so many people, and while it's still talked about all these years later."
149,dazed_and_confused,audience,4.0,p,"The soundtrack to this movie was just simply amazing, very well used at the moment it showed up!
I personally wouldn't say that this movie has a plot, in lack of that it tells different stories so that we are able to get various teenage experiences and to be able to connect to a certain character."

169,up_in_smoke_1978,audience,3.5,p,"There is a basic misconception that you need to be a pot smoker, or stoned, to appreciate the humor of Cheech and Chong.   This is not true.   They use drug based humor as the fulcrum of their comedy, but they are just very funny.   This is the film that started it all for them.  This prompted a new generation of Buddy comedy films that are reminiscent of some of the comedy duos of all time.  Ethnic humor, class and socioeconomic commentary, and coming of age are all fair game for this team of comedy geniuses.   Listen the film does reek of the 1970's but the humor still holds up and it is one fo the best ways to revisit the look, feel, and sound of the 1970's.   I love that so many noted actors took roles which were self-effacing in this film.   Great fun.  I was never a pot smoker but I was always a Cheech and Chong's humor.  The soundtrack is great."
170,up_in_smoke_1978,audience,2.5,n,"I don't think anybody considers the stoner comedy to be 'high art', but it's been a cultural mainstay for decades now, and it's a trend that would not look the same without Cheech and Chong, and Up in Smoke is their defining film. It's difficult to call this Adler cult classic anything beyond 'one note' and crude, but those are practically inalienable features of the genre; lines like ""freeze, you chili-choking pepper belly"" and throwaway characters such as a Japanese reporter named 'Toyota Kawasaki' are perfect examples of the experience that you'll get with the comedy duo, which suffers from many of the problems prominent with sketch/stage groups attempting to make the jump to theatrical-length productions - trouble building a long-form story that goes beyond a series of stitched-together sketches.

The comedy is 75% oriented around really low-hanging drug humor, mostly people making 'high' voices accompanied by plenty of instances of Tommy Chong saying ""man"" (well over 200 times in a sub-90 minute runtime across all characters), occasionally broken up by the occasional appearance of a squad of incompetent police officers led with some good comedic timing from Stacy Keach, who honestly often feel more fun than our main characters just for the sake of variety if nothing else. It wasn't intended to stand the test of time, but based on a few classic lines, some genuine laughs, and a substantial impact on pop culture, Up in Smoke is at least worth a watch once in your life. (2.5/5)"

181,kissing_jessica_stein,critics,fresh,p,"Charles Herman-Wurmfeld's comedy remains the best film spawned by ""Sex and the City."" This sharp-tongued story about emotional curiosity and the politics of passion draws on the words of a dead Austrian poet to muse about modern romance."

So the cases are two. One: I did and I cannot even remember it (so it is very forgettable). Two: I did not, but it felt like I did (so does not bring anything new to me).
So it does not matter, because at the end I have to give a low mark to it (and try to avoid it's vision for the 3rd time)"

1,ace_ventura_pet_detective,critics,fresh,p,The surprisingly enjoyable family comedy that catapulted Jim Carrey to fame and fortune as the most popular funnyman of the 1990s.
2,ace_ventura_pet_detective,critics,fresh,p,Your reaction to this fast and furious farce will largely depend on whether you find Carrey's distinctive style of extremely physical comedy -- often compared to that of Jerry Lewis -- stupidly hilarious or downright annoying.
3,ace_ventura_pet_detective,critics,rotten,n,"Put a leash on Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and call it a dog. This mangy comedy showcase for funnyman Jim Carrey trots through virtually every lowbrow laugh-getter imaginable, short of hiking its leg over a fire hydrant."
4,ace_ventura_pet_detective,critics,fresh,p,"Playing a celebrated finder of missing mammals, [Carrey's] so over-energized from the start you keep thinking he'll wear out his welcome pronto; 90 minutes later his lunacy is still hard to take your eyes off."
5,ace_ventura_pet_detective,critics,rotten,n,"Replete with rude noises, pathetic table manners and bathroom jokes that would discredit a second grader, Ace Ventura is an endeavor that all concerned should omit from their résumés."
6,ace_ventura_pet_detective,critics,fresh,p,Director Tom Shadyac's film belongs to Carrey. Ace Ventura: Pet Detective proves he is more than a TV sketch artist. Carrey's a comic find.
7,ace_ventura_pet_detective,critics,fresh,p,"Ace Ventura, Pet Detective is probably the Citizen Kane of pet detective movies and 30 seconds after walking out, you won't remember anyone except Carrey. But in its relentlessly stupid way, it's very funny."
8,ace_ventura_pet_detective,critics,fresh,p,"It's certainly uncouth, and occasionally offensive. But it's also brimming with energy, moderately inventive, and sometimes even funny."
9,ace_ventura_pet_detective,critics,fresh,p,...it's certainly not difficult to see why Carrey was almost immediately launched into superstardom after its 1994 release.

14,ace_ventura_pet_detective,critics,rotten,n,"[Carrey's] comic language is made up of accent marks, not characters; instead of inhabiting a scene, he swallows it up and spits it out in manic doodles."
15,ace_ventura_pet_detective,critics,rotten,n,The only possible attraction is Carrey's gonzo star turn.
16,ace_ventura_pet_detective,critics,rotten,n,"Unlike famous bumbling sleuths such as Inspector Clouseau and Lt. Frank Drebin, there's no consistency to the ""Ace"" character, and the whole movie shifts in tone from social satire to sophomoric pranks and traditional copshow plotting."

I was shocked that anyone would sit through this, no less through a sequel.  Maybe I just don't get the humor- but I am ok with that."
27,ace_ventura_pet_detective,audience,4.5,p,"A Pet Detective? Yea Jim Carrey much like Adam Sandler's earlier films is the best than the current films. This is a cult classic and a must-watch for anyone wanting a fun comedic film. Laugh and laugh and laugh. 

Jim Carrey (Ace Ventura) Helping the Miami Dolphins search for the team Mascott Snow Flake the Dolphin, which was actually a real Dolphin that was in a tank in the infield of the Miami Dolphins Stadium during the early years of the team."
28,ace_ventura_pet_detective,audience,2.0,n,Carrey basically plays himself in the role as a loony Pet Detective and just like the crazy mannerisms of Ace the films’s script is scattered all over the place.
29,ace_ventura_pet_detective,audience,4.0,p,When this movie originally aired I was in my 20's and I laughed so hard I couldn't breath. It has NOT aged well. Or I matured. Whatever the root cause I can't watch it without without feeling it's just dumb now. I tried watching it with my young nephews and they are too sophisticated to truly find it humorous. *sigh* Kinda bums me out. Kinda wish that we could hold onto some of that innocence that made fart jokes funny. Or at least maybe find a couple hours a month when Jim Carey's brand of stupid silly still could make me laugh that hard again.

53,40_year_old_virgin,audience,4.5,p,"This is me when I'm 60.

Man watching this late at night with my bois was so much fun, just like when we watched the Dictator. The sex and racist jokes were SO goddamn hilarious. Some moments didn't land, but most of them made my belly hurt. 

I loved pretty much every actor in this movie. Steve Carrell and his main squad was so great and their chemistry was on point. 

In addition to the fun stuff, the story was just a bit too relatable to some of us, even though we are nowhere close to 40 years old. Because of this, certain scenes became sad, and I could sympathize with the 40 year old virgin.

My problem was some characters could have had more impact. Also, the movie was like 10-15 minutes too long. But they didn't bother me too much.

Overall, a hilarious and relatable story filled with great performance. 8.5/10"
54,40_year_old_virgin,audience,3.0,p,It's a very funny movie with an original premice. Some things definitely aged very badly. There are definitely some racist and sexist things in there.

58,40_year_old_virgin,audience,4.5,p,"The 40 Year Old Virgin - 9/10. Judd Apatow's debut feature film introduced to us an interesting protagonist: what would happen if the people around him found out that he was a virgin? An adult comedy that ended up becoming a huge success and launching pad for many involved (Steve Carrell, Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, Romany Malco, Jane Lynch, Elizabeth Banks, Kevin Hart, Catherine Keener, Kat Dennings, Mindy Kaling and Jonah Hill). But as the years have gone by, many of those names have become even more famous through other various tv and film projects. With that fame also came more recognition from those projects, which in a way made people forget about this film in a sense. Strange to think, considering how successful this film was in 2005, and the kind of influence it had on adult comedy films from then on. The story is an interesting topic in a sense of how its dealt with. There are your typical crude humour jokes that come with an Apatow project, but the overall story is actually a sweet and caring one. This is probably one of the only movies that I can think of off the top of my head where genuinely, every single character wishes and wants the best for the title character. There are hilarious fights and arguments between the characters at some points, but its never out of maliciousness. Steve Carrell plays his character so well, with a great mix of physical humour and dialogue delivery. Considering that The Office also premiered that year, the tides were turning to showcase how great of an actor he was. The camaraderie between Carrell, Rogen, Rudd, and Malco also helps make this film be so funny to watch every rewatch. They all start off as coworkers and end off as friends that genuinely try to improve the title character's life, while also having their own lives changed thanks to becoming friends with Carrell's character. Its also a great example of talking about a topic that is personal to some, and mix it in with great comedy. Its a defining comedy of the 00's, and deserves a little more popularity in my opinion. One of those movies that never ceases to be boring after multiple watches!"

He didn't bury the remains."
86,1016819-producers,audience,5.0,p,"Zero Mostel is a hilarious fool!

Mel Brooks' satirical comedy The Producers (1967) spoofs creative Hollywood accounting and crooked producers. Mel Brooks directs the erratic conversations of mad producers with a gleeful jaded apathy towards the feelings of foolish men who throw millions of dollars around to fund garbage artistic endeavors needlessly. Brooks' direction for the musical numbers is hilarious and energetic with a whimsy and sarcasm that pierces you with the absurdity of it all. Everything feels like a play brought to life with a zealous irreverence that only Mel Brooks can provide.

The Producers is funny on another level by having Jewish writer Mel Brooks satirizing Germany's Nazi Party and Adolf Hitler's Third Reich as goofy fools to make their claims of being the master race all the more ridiculous. The Producers is a masterful comedy with endless wit and increasing humor derived from the crazy show business industry. Mel Brooks is such an innovative writer, coming up with the funniest comedy premise ever for The Producers, in thinking of Springtime for Hitler. It's a real blast.

Zero Mostel is like Dom DeLuise, John Candy, Chris Farley, and Orson Welles all wrapped up in one manic maniac. Watching Zero date numerous elderly ladies for their production checks for his terrible plays is hilarious. Zero Mostel steals the show throughout The Producers as corrupt and shameless producer Max Bialystock. He's a force of nature storming into each scene with a boisterous personality and his booming voice. Every failure is seen in his eyes and each wicked concept tastes so sweet coming from his fat lips. Zero is perfectly cast in The Producers.

Gene Wilder is outrageous and hysterical as idiotic accountant Leo Bloom. He's a great straight man next to Mostel's outgoing Bialystock. Dick Shawn's silly character L.S.D. is a riot as a surfer hippie incarnation of Adolf Hitler in Springtime for Hitler. Kenneth Mars is hilarious as German defector Franz Liebkind, with his Hitler worshipping and distraught German pride.

Lee Meredith is absolutely drop dead gorgeous as Ulla, Zero Mostel's ""secretary."" Her 1960's mod fashion and dancing was dazzling and delightful. Her Swedish accent is like a sweet playful spoof of Liv Ullman or Bibi Andersson. Renee Taylor is stunning as Eva Braun, but she's really immediately fun due to her distinctive high pitched voice. 

Christopher Hewitt's effeminate director Roger De Bris is very funny, especially coupled with the weird Andreas Voutsinas as Carmen Ghia. Estelle Winwood is shockingly fun as the old lady Zero is scamming dubbed ""Hold Me Touch Me."" A young William Hickey has a neat cameo as The Drunk, whom Zero buys alcohol for until he's blackout. Mel Brooks himself cameos as one of the singers in the musical too.

Ralph Rosenbaum cuts sharply to new angles and perspectives with a brisk attention to The Producers' pace. It's only an 88 minute long movie, so it's nice that it also moves along quickly. Joseph F. Coffey's cinematography looks amazing capturing each sweaty face in his close-ups and every goose stepping foot in magnificent wide shots. Charles Rosen's production design gets both a sleazy, opulent producer's office right as well as a WWII war room musical set made for The Producers.

John Morris' score is lively and memorable. I really love the song ""Springtime for Hitler."" Mel Brooks actually wrote fun and catchy lyrics parodying Hitler's regime. Gene Coffin's costumes are a funny blend of 60's mod dresses for the ladies, colorful suits for the men, and flashy Nazi uniforms to dazzle and disgust you for the musical numbers. Irving Buchman's natural make-up looks great for The Producers' raw feel, while appearing cute on all the actresses.

In short, Mel Brooks is a brilliant comedy writer and a skilled director. The Producers is an early classic of the comedy genre from a laughter master."
87,1016819-producers,audience,4.0,p,Essential Mel Brooks comedy
88,1016819-producers,audience,3.0,p,"In Mel Brooks' directorial debut, a desperate Broadway producer (Zero Mostel) and his insecure accountant (Gene Wilder) discover that it can be just as profitable to stage an abject failure of a Broadway play than to produce a hit.  The result? Springtime for Hitler.  The laughs in The Producer vary wildly, as some scenes, especially later in the movie, provide laugh out loud comedic bits, while others tend to fall painfully short of anything resembling comedy.  There tends to be far too much in the way of yelling and ridiculous physical humor, but once you wade through all of the garbage, the scenes from Springtime for Hitler are pure comedy gold."
89,1016819-producers,audience,5.0,p,"Hilarious. Absolutely hilarious. Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder’s chemistry is the heartbeat of the movie, and the supporting cast is the lungs and backbone. Mel Brooks’ unique screenplay and surefire direction showcase a talent that would entertain for years. The whole movie is politically incorrect, but at the same time it isn’t cruel. Instead, it shows exactly how satire is supposed to work: punching up at groups like the Nazis rather than punching down at their victims."

144,safety_last,audience,5.0,p,No need for words in this silent comedy classic!
145,safety_last,audience,4.0,p,"Pretty standard silent comedy from Harold Lloyd, with a timeless, unforgettable third act. The setup is basic enough; it's the well-worn yarn of an ambitious young go-getter who moves to the city and finds that getting rich quick isn't quite as easy as he'd expected. He puts on an act for correspondence, boasting of a high-dollar lifestyle and shipping gifts to his girl while rent on his meager apartment goes unpaid; unwittingly spinning himself a flimsy web that tangles when the aforementioned love interest pops in for an unannounced visit. That leads to a few good bits of physical comedy, some crafty sleight of hand, several near-misses, but the premise drags after a while and the action is too often interrupted by unnecessary title cards.

It's only when he stumbles into a chance to actually make that long-sought bank, climbing the face of a twelve-story building as a promotional stunt, that the picture really hits its stride and jumps to a new level. Lloyd is incredible in these scenes, expertly toying with our anticipation and tempting fate with every step. He teeters on the brink (and even tumbles over the edge) countless times, always with a new gimmick or snare to up the ante, while the spectacular camera angles ensure that a crucial, cringing sense of risk is never lost.

I'd say the special effects hold up astonishingly for a century-old picture, but these weren't really effects at all. Though a misstep may not have led to *certain* death (a flimsy scaffold, just out of frame, allegedly provided some peace of mind), Lloyd was really gripping that skyscraper a hundred feet in the air, with an expansive view of 1920s Los Angeles spread out behind him. The gamble pays off; thanks to the seamless view, our subconscious worry makes for more nail-biting peril and quicker laughs when that tension is, momentarily, diffused. As a package, Safety Last is entertaining and well-made, but maybe not a top-notch example of the era. That last act, though, earns every last one of the callbacks and tributes it's been paid over the years."

171,beetlejuice,audience,4.0,p,"Keaton's performance is strong, and the story is fantastic. ""Beetlejuice"" stands as one of the best films from the 80s, providing a goofy and comical storyline that never gets boring or tiring, though it can it times become a little too over-the-top, especially from Michael Keaton. The comedy lands, and the entire film from start to finish remains extremely iconic and still stands the test of time in terms of everything but its overdone CGI, which feels repetitive and completely overused. However, this film is just too much fun to dislike, and the entire movie from start to finish remains an iconic 80s flick that is still very rewatchable to this day."

179,beetlejuice,audience,4.0,p,"""Beetlejuice"" is a dark comedy from the twisted mind of Tim Burton. The premise is a simple one, newlydead couple the Maitlands want their home to themselves and not shared with a Yuppie couple and their goth daughter. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are suitably cast as the newly dead couple  who are having trouble scaring away the family who purchased their home. Requiring help they embark on employing a Bio exorcist called Betelgeuse played perfectly by the scene stealing Michael Keaton.

Crammed full of visual invention, both the living and dead worlds have outlandish interiors and costumes that bring a surreal almost cartoon feel to the movie. There is a lot to enjoy in this movie, a brilliant soundtrack featuring some of Harry Belafonte's most famous songs , glorious gags, and Keaton's manic comedic genius."

Leslie Nielsen (in a precursor to the Naked Gun), Robert Stack, and Lloyd Bridges appear to enjoy portraying characters that lampoon their previous dramatic roles.  Although the dialogue and references to films such as From Here to Eternity and Saturday Nigh Fever will mainly appeal to adults, gags such as the jive talking granny and exchanges such as ""Surely/Shirley"" will have kids rolling.

Along the way it mixes embarrassingly obvious puns and sight gags with quick witted knocks at everyday airport/airplane situations.  Parents should note that most of the jokes are at the expense of religious and ethnic groups.  They aren't mean spirited yet some might interpret it as offensive."

Ferris borrows his best friend's dad's Ferrari and goes on a cursing day, while the principal is on to him and tries catching him.
	An aspect of the film that stood out to me was Matthew Broderick acting in the movie. I liked the way his character was so determined to stay home so that he can have a fun day with his friend and girl without anyone noticing or getting caught.
	Overall I didn't really like the film because to me it was boring. I would not recommend it to viewers like myself because it's not a film I liked and it was boring to me. Out of 5 stars I would give it 2 stars because the movie just wasn't for me."
22,ferris_buellers_day_off,audience,4.5,p,"What can I say about Ferris Bueller's day off besides that I loved it. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a 1986 American teen comedy film written, co-produced, and directed by John Hughes, and co-produced by Tom Jacobson. The film stars Matthew Broderick as Ferris Bueller, a high-school slacker who skips school for a day in Chicago, with Mia Sara as his girlfriend Sloane Peterson and Alan Ruck who plays his best friend Cameron Fry. The movie is part of the 80s slap stick era of comedy with home made contraptions and close calls that followed the home alone franchise.

The films story is about ferris wanting one last ditch day with his friends. Ferris makes his parents and school believe he is really sick and soon rumors state the ferris needs a new kidney which has the repeated joke through out the movie which is the simple phrase ""Save Ferris"". Ferris's sister and principle dont believe that ferris is really sick and that he is ditching. The side stories then follow what the principle and Ferris's sister do to try and catch him while ditching.

Front a technical aspect the movie is also pretty good. It Shows off the downtown chicago really well with shots taken in Sears tower and other skyscraper. It is a blast from the past showing chicago not chriraq as it has been known today. The other settings are really good for example ferris's house is actually in laguna beach and not chicago but unless you know architecture you wouldnt know. It is because of all of these reason i give the movie a 4.5/5"
23,ferris_buellers_day_off,audience,5.0,p,"Wit and Unforsaken fun 


Have you ever wanted to skip school, but your strict parents wouldn't let you? Well, you're in luck because in the movie John Hudges and starring Matthew Broderick as Ferris Bueller, we learn just that. Ferris Bueller wants a day off of school, so he comes up with a sophisticated plan to do just that. The problem is that he has been absent for many days, so his principal, Ed Rooney, played by Jefferey Jones, is on the hunt for Ferris and his friends for playing hookey for too long. Will he catch them? Will Ferris come up with yet another brilliant plan? Well, to answer that, you should wait and watch. 


I enjoyed the idea of Ferris Bueller about to be caught in almost every scene. I wanted how Ferris could've been caught. So many different times in the exact times if someone was looking. For example, when he is on the TV where the principal is sitting and sulking about not catching him. It makes the audience want to scream at the person for not seeing them. 


Overall, this movie is 8/5 marrons for me because of the constant action and comedy in these high schoolers' young lives. For anyone not watching or was hesitant to watch this movie, you should just watch it. It's a bunch of fun and exciting to see if he'll get caught or if he will get away with it or not. This movie is also relatable in some aspects, like the teenage romance and whatnot."
24,ferris_buellers_day_off,audience,5.0,p,"Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a film directed by John Hughes, produced in 1986. Starring Matthew Broderick and Alan Ruck. It is a comedy film. The film was of a high schooler named Ferris Bueller, who took the day off of school. He was already getting away with not showing up to class and not getting caught with the many tricks he is skilled in. And he took his friend Cameron and girlfriend along to Chicago driving Cameron's dad's Ferrari. His principal was determined to try to catch him in the act because he knew of Ferris' tricks.
The single aspect that stood out to me was Ferris having Cameron tag along in his ideas. It was sad that Cameron was always worried to get caught. While Ferris would be having the time of his life. And that despite Cameron being worried he genuinely admires Ferris for not letting anything get in the way. I did think it was selfish of Ferris not to consider Cameron's feelings though he is always worried. It did show how easily manipulated Cameron is though he is aware of how Ferris is. 
The quality of this movie was good. I would recommend this film to viewers like myself because it was a fun comedy film. I give it a five out of five stars. I enjoyed watching the ways Ferris has used his skills of not getting caught. And it was funny how Ferris always got his way when pretending to be someone else to get what he wanted. Also, it was interesting that everybody in the school believed Ferris was home and extremely ill."
25,ferris_buellers_day_off,audience,4.5,p,"An absurdly fun movie that, while it can get slightly over-the-top, ends up being an enjoyable film that remains timeless still to this day. The cast is perfect for their roles, the story is wacky, though insanely fun and ends up having a great message by the end that holds up even today. The humor lands every time, and the absolute sheer enjoyment that the actors seem to be constantly having makes this film as good as it is. Overall, just a great movie that is sure to keep a smile on your face throughout its entire runtime."
26,ferris_buellers_day_off,audience,4.5,p,"Think back to when you were a teenager. Remember the times we all dreaded. Waking up in the morning at the crack of dawn only to get ready to sit in boredom in a classroom that took a chunk of your day. Now, imagine if you had the chance to skip a day and have it all to yourself. What would await you? Some dumb fun with friends or the consequences of your own actions. In the Film Ferris Bueller's Day Off It follows that exact scenario. The film was directed by John Hughes and released on June 11th, 1986, and it is considered one of the greats in 80s films. 
 
A single aspect in the film that really caught my eye was the acting, the Fourth Wall breaks to be specific. The film is very comedic, and someone can even say the comedic value is on par with Home Alone, but the comedic moments in Ferris Buellers are enhanced with these fourth wall breaks. Ferris who's played by Mathew Broderik is the only character who's able to break the Fourth Wall and he does it quite a lot in the film. The moments when he talks directly to the audience make him look like a cocky teenager who's able to bend the rules of his parents every time, while also giving the audience something to laugh at. 
 
My overall reaction to the film was positive. I saw little to no downsides to the film and experienced nothing, but the dumb fun of a teenager's day off from school. Despite being from the 80s the film's comedy has not aged one bit. I believe anyone with a sense of humor is able to come watch this film and have no trouble having a good laugh. If I had to rate the movie out of 5 stars, I would give it a 4.5. I think it deserves a 4.5 because as a good movie for what it is despite being a fantastic film that can have people laughing and smiling it isn't something to write home about."

54,sherlock-jr,audience,3.5,p,"Silent movies don't always have my interest unless there is something that truly sticks out about them. In ""Sherlock Jr."" I think the main quality is the filmmaking techniques that are just so ahead of its time. The movie has very solid visual effects and it is truly magical when I realize how old this movie is. The movie isn't very long, so the story is fairly simple for today's standards, but it still feels very unique for its time. The only really movie I can compare it to is another Buster Keaton movie I have seen, ""The General."" I think that movie is a little bit more entertaining than this one, but there is still a good amount to admire here. Overall, this movie is an impressive movie that I liked a lot at a technical level."
55,sherlock-jr,audience,4.5,p,"Movie critics in 1924 that wanted a story were disappointed by all the mechanisms of Buster Keaton's ""Sherlock Jr.""

The film is filled with iconic scenes (miniature Stonehenge, the amp that goes to 11, the album signing event, etc…) but succeeds on the strength of the characters and the rapport that exists between them.  Even as their collective careers teeter on the edge of oblivion, they are able to naively hang on to some degree of hope."

84,this_is_spinal_tap,audience,5.0,p,"There is nothing I can say about this movie that can add or distract from it. It is a force of nature and in my opinion, the most perfect of movies. I've debated adding it to the site numerous times, but my worry was that it's so ingrained in my heart that there was no way I could do it justice. So instead, let me share my favorite scene from the movie and explain why it means so much to me and then you can just watch the damn thing yourself.

As limo driver Tommy Pischedda (Bruno Kirby) drives Spinal Tap through New York City and all seems bright and the future wide open, he makes the faux pas of thinking that he can directly interact with rock gods. He looks in the back of his car and addresses one of their female admirers: ""Excuse me… are you reading ""Yes I Can""?""

Tommy may not understand this heavy metal, but he does know the Rat Pack. That's the kind of celebrity culture that he understands. People that deserve to be there. People that have given blood and sweat and sacrificed. But maybe, just maybe, these longhaired kids are trying.

""You know what the title of that book should be? ""Yes, I Can If Frank Sinatra Says It's OK,"""" shares Tommy. ""‘Cause Frank calls the shots for all of those guys. Did you get to the part yet where uh…Sammy is coming out of the Copa…it's about 3 o'clock in the morning and, uh, he sees Frank? Frank's walking down Broadway by himself…""

At this point, Nigel Tufnel, the guitarist of the band, rolls up the window that separates the celebrity from the hired help. It's a bracing and truth-packed moment, as the look on Tommy's face shows that he should have never opened himself to such scorn.

Rockumentarian and Tap fan Marti DiBergi tries to deal with the chill in the air, offering, ""Well, you know, they're not, uh, used to that world. You know, Frank Sinatra, it's a different world that they're in.""

The sheer exhaustion in Tommy's speech that follows, as well as his know-it-all feeling on the world of celebrity follows. ""You know, it's just that people like this…you know…they get all they want so they really don't understand, you know…about a life-like Frank's. I mean, when you've loved and lost the way Frank has, then you, uh, you know what life's about.""

But what sums it all up is when he says, ""F****' limeys.""

Look, Spinal Tap is the only movie that the IMDB allows you to rate an eleven. If I have to tell you anything else, you just won't understand either."

112,top_five,critics,fresh,p,"Rock and Dawson spark in long, uncut scenes of dialogue that echo Before Midnight. Flirting and sparring throughout the film, they are at the heart of the story but Rock has populated the movie with other interesting characters and cameos."
113,top_five,critics,rotten,n,"On one hand, it's an insightful examination of fame and artistic freedom. On the other, it's a sexual comedy of the most obscene nature."
114,top_five,critics,fresh,p,Top Five...finally gives Rock the filmic vehicle he has needed since he tried to transition to the screen.
115,top_five,critics,fresh,p,Big laughs and believable vulnerability. But it also has aged faster than Indiana Jones Nazis unable to spot the cup of a carpenter and relies on truly retrograde eye-rolling plot turns about reporters' motives.
116,top_five,critics,fresh,p,"Featuring the funniest sex scene since Team America, and a film-stealing cameo from an unexpected rapper, Top Five is such an enjoyable watch that it's easy to ignore how slick and clever it often is."
117,top_five,critics,fresh,p,"Rock's script isn't afraid to get raunchy, sometimes a little too much, but there is a bit of heart at the center. Dawson and Rock have the chemistry to make it work, even when it feels a little contrived."
118,top_five,critics,fresh,p,"Let's hope that this wasn't just a one-off for the comedian, but something tells me that he has much more to say."
119,top_five,critics,fresh,p,"Though Rock is funny throughout the film, the story would have collapsed in the absence of the cameos."
120,top_five,critics,rotten,n,A weirdly hollow story that is neither funny enough nor moving enough.
121,top_five,critics,fresh,p,"The film, like Rock, is impressive, gritty, real to the bone and sidesplittingly funny."
122,top_five,critics,fresh,p,This is not only the best movie thing accomplished stand-up comic Chris Rock will probably ever do. It is also one of the coolest and most endearing rom-coms of the past few years.
123,top_five,critics,fresh,p,"This movie attacks comedy in so many various ways: snark, sarcasm, quips, one-lines, everything on such an intellectual level, especially if you know the pop culture references being made via certain moments in hip-hop or mainstream media."
124,top_five,critics,fresh,p,"Chris Rock bleeds many elements of his stand-up comedy routine into a person that is simply sick and tired of being famous for lowbrow pandering slapstick comedy, possibly like himself"
125,top_five,critics,fresh,p,"I went into Chris Rock's Top Five with a checklist of expectations, and I am happy to say that my expectations were met, and even exceeded in places."
126,top_five,critics,fresh,p,"To watch this film is to see Chris [Rock]'s - and every comedian's - turbulent, messy, passionate, longstanding romance with his craft"
127,top_five,critics,fresh,p,Top Five does the trick.
128,top_five,critics,fresh,p,"Overall, I appreciate what this film does in showcasing a more serious Chris Rock. I think it's his best film to date."
129,top_five,critics,rotten,n,"The romance is contrived; the sexual jokes rarely land; and the cameos seem more for show than for storytelling. That's not to say that I didn't laugh, or enjoy it, but it's horribly predictable, and about as frequently tasteless as it is charming"
130,top_five,critics,fresh,p,Top Five gives us a glimpse of [Rock's] comic genius. Just a tad.
131,top_five,audience,3.5,p,"This was a funny movie, but hey, did he get married or stay with the reporter?  Lots of great comedians in the cast."
132,top_five,audience,4.0,p,"I saw TOP 5 the other day. Top 5 is a comedy starring Chris Rock as a comedian turned major celebrity and his attempts to reinvent himself and his career with a serious drama that he believes will help him prove to himself and the world that he's not just another funnyman. If you're sitting around thinking to yourself that this summary sounds strangely similar to the plot of Birdman, well you're right! This happens to be yet another example of Hollywood coming up with similar ideas for films at the same time and I know some of you are thinking, ""well if this movie is the same as Birdman and this one stars Chris Rock, who's track record in film is far below stellar, then I'll skip it."" Well I'll tell you this, you should definitely reconsider because against all odds, for the first time in many years, Chris Rock delivers!

From what I understand, Chris Rock took a different approach to making this movie and it really shows. His previous films showed a lot of signs of a movie made by committee with a lot of pulled punches and soft comedy that seemed much less caustic and biting than Rock's standup or anything seen in Rock's 90's sketch comedy in The Chris Rock Show. This movie however, was done with Rock squarely in the driver's seat acting as the writer, director and star and he does a good job in all respects creating a comedy showcase that had me laughing out loud in the theater and overall just out and out thrilled that old school Chris Rock was back and truly better than ever. Perhaps the best thing about the movie is that Rock is not alone in this film. Some pretty big names came out to help carry this movie including Gabrielle Union who plays Rock's fiancé, Rosario Dawson who plays an interviewer trying to get his life story and dozens and dozens of other comedians that drop in here and there to fill out the cast. The comedians really make this movie. Cedric the Entertainer, JB Smoove, Leslie Jones, Tracy Morgan and many other names great and small are here that I can't even begin to tell you about them all and they each do their part to contribute a verse to this kick-ass movie. Another good thing about this movie is the fact that it isn't afraid to tell edgy jokes or show nudity like so many great comedies in the 80s did. Nothing is off limits and nothing is too sacred or taboo to poke fun at. It's comedy with teeth and I loved it from start to finish. If I had to say anything bad about it I would have to say that it does have a bit of a time juggling all the balls it has in the air but by the end, all the loose ends are tied up in a pretty sweet package.

On the whole, I really enjoyed this movie and if you're a fan of comedy and stand-up comedians then you'll like this one too. Top Five gets a 4...out of 5."
133,top_five,audience,4.0,p,"This movie had surprising pathos and soul with some real laugh out loud humor.  The performances by Chris Rock, Rosario Dawson, and a host of well placed supporting comedians add dimension and heart to what would otherwise be a generally formulaic romcom.  On top of the fun, it's worth a watch just to get the real perspective of the cast as they count off their ""Top Five"""
134,top_five,audience,3.5,p,"Chris Rock tried playing an unfunny guy, but fails miserably"
135,top_five,audience,4.0,p,"In case you didn't already realize how incredibly talented, intelligent, and empathetic Chris Rock's work really is, there is no denying it after seeing him helm the director's chair for the first time. The film is as funny as you would expect, as sharply insightful as you would hope, and more romantic than you would guess. Raising issues of celebrity, dependency, artistry, race, class, the central question here is fidelity-not just to a partner, but to one's own desire and sense of imagined self. And on that front, Rock's late dive into the triple threat of writing/directing/starring feels less like a shift in his ambitions than it does the organic fruition of a brilliant career."
136,top_five,audience,1.5,n,This movie wasn’t actually all that funny. It had its moments but didn’t add up. Was dull and went nowhere other than it’s laughs.
137,top_five,audience,2.5,n,disappointing for such a big cast with little or no laughs
138,top_five,audience,0.5,n,Self involved and uninteresting.
139,top_five,audience,3.5,p,"I had a good time watching this movie; it was very predictable but I don't think it was meant to be a mysterious movie. It was fun, not that funny; like Chris Rock stand-up funny but it had some moments."
140,top_five,audience,5.0,p,"I loved this movie. I didn't know what to expect when I saw it and I had low expectations. But so glad I took the time to watch. Chris is hilarious, and the story was cute."
141,blues_brothers,critics,fresh,p,"No matter that the big screen story gets convoluted and improbable-the characters make it work. They sing classic rhythm and blues songs well enough, but better yet, perform with the greats."
142,blues_brothers,critics,rotten,n,"The Blues Brothers are a popular novelty, and have a definite tongue-in-cheek appeal. But this film does nothing with the characters, except to portray them as a couple of one-sided and unlikable hoods."
143,blues_brothers,critics,fresh,p,"The Blues Brothers is the year's best film to date; one of the, all-time great comedies; the best movie ever made in Chicago. All are true, and, boy, is that ever a surprise."
144,blues_brothers,critics,fresh,p,"The Blues Brothers is unlike anything you've ever seen before, at once touching and far-far out -- and most of all, best of all, it is hugely entertaining."
145,blues_brothers,critics,rotten,n,"Too many times, The Blues Brothers is static when it should be ecstatic. When it tries to hit the heights, it's not nearly dizzying enough And when it should soar, it simply hangs there."
146,blues_brothers,critics,rotten,n,"Despite the temporary lift that the old pros give the picture, it is difficult for the non-cultist to feel anything but dismay, again, that so much has been squandered to produce so little that is truly artful or genuinely entertaining."
147,blues_brothers,critics,fresh,p,"As spectacular as the chases are, Blues Brothers works because of Aykroyd and Belushi, who play off each other with nearly flawless timing and sustain it throughout the movie's two hours and 10 minutes."
148,blues_brothers,critics,rotten,n,"The film is a monument to car wreckage, with a tip of the hat to rhythm and blues. If you've seen the preview, you've seen the movie."
149,blues_brothers,critics,rotten,n,"Only the music, a collection of rock and blues hits, is palatable but not enough to pull this film out of the gutter."
150,blues_brothers,critics,fresh,p,With a simple narrative based around the- brothers trying to put together a band and raising money for the orphanage that moulded them with numerous complications along the way there are plenty of chances for viewers to be entertained.
151,blues_brothers,critics,rotten,n,"The film is a dreary waste of crude gags and misfiring stunts. But... small relief is afforded along the way by musical encounters (all too brief) with John Lee Hooker, Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles."
152,blues_brothers,critics,fresh,p,"But, for all those excesses. The Blues Brothers is jaunty enough often enough and joyous enough just enough to escape total disaster and to tantalize the determined."
153,blues_brothers,critics,fresh,p,"Landis' staging and camera blocking aren't always up to the task, but the performers are so electrifying, it doesn't much matter."
154,blues_brothers,critics,rotten,n,The Blues Brothers is a joke that went too far.
155,blues_brothers,critics,rotten,n,"The Blues Brothers really is the sort of enterprise that makes, you wonder what the world is coming to."
156,blues_brothers,critics,fresh,p,The Blues Brothers keeps our attention with its general good humor musical expertise and the myriad of comic details with which Landis fills every scene.
157,blues_brothers,critics,rotten,n,"Elsewhere flat characterisation and flimsy subplots -- who ever dreamed up those Nazis? -- numb the brain and add up to an expense of spirit in a waste of time, talent and money."
158,blues_brothers,critics,rotten,n,"Between [musical] numbers there are a number of good laughs, but most of the comedy falls flat through constant over-statement. The 20-car prang where two might do philosophy, spills through the whole film."
159,blues_brothers,critics,rotten,n,The plot here is merely an excuse to slam Big Names up on the Big Screen and enact enough big crashes to give some of us a big headache.
160,blues_brothers,critics,fresh,p,"A loving musical tribute, a raucous comedy and an amazing demolition derby -- The Blues brothers is all these and more. Filmed in and near Chicago, the home of electric blues, it is extravagant pandemonium -- continuous and delightful."
161,blues_brothers,audience,5.0,p,Pure musical madness.
162,blues_brothers,audience,5.0,p,"This movie is by far my favorite. With a church, Chicago, Fischer, and every law enforcement agency you can think of, this movie is a must see. Not to mention, the jailhouse rock at the end."
163,blues_brothers,audience,0.5,n,"Watched all of this highly rated classic hoping it would get better. It didn't. The film only has 2 things going for it: the car chase stunts, and the music. The acting is bad; if it ever was funny it sure isn't now; everything is OTT but in an unfunny way. My advice is to listen to the soundtrack but give the film a miss."
164,blues_brothers,audience,2.0,n,"This movie is a landmark-it was responsible for Chicago becoming the setting for a number of future movies. On its own, it is based on a Saturday Night Live sketch about two white characters with pretensions of being blues musicians. Add a number of major real-life blues musicians and an even larger number of car crashes, and that's the recipe for the movie.

The premise is about two brothers, one just out of Joliet prison, who try to raise money to save an orphanage from closing down, and to do so, bring together the members of their old band. Of course, their efforts to do so end up causing trouble with the law, as well as other people (such as a country and western-themed bar and the band that was supposed to play there). In the end, dozens of police cars chase after them, and even the National Guard, before they fulfill their quest. There are some genuinely funny parts, but overall the whole movie depends on exaggeration-twenty police cars crashing into twenty police cars, as critic Roger Ebert had put it."
165,blues_brothers,audience,5.0,p,"40 years in and this hilarious musical farce remains as fresh as the first time I saw it.  It has its ""haters"" I'm sure, but that's because its humour skewers the pretentious and the politically correct at every turn.  Set those affectations aside and there are multiple layers on which to enjoy this movie.  Who knew actors could sing?  Who knew blues musicians could act?  Who knew they could all dance so well?  Marvel at the comedic timing & instincts of John Belushi & Dan Ackroyd, at the absolute top of their game.  Glory in the great R&B numbers, delivered by the industry legends who made these hits.  Reflect on some of the subtle social commentary layered in beneath the farce.  Most of all, if you can't tap your toes to this one, you better check for a pulse!"
166,blues_brothers,audience,4.0,p,Who cannot love these two SNL actors that struck it big in this farcical movie!
167,blues_brothers,audience,5.0,p,Loved it! Great song playlist throughout the movie. Loved the characters and the chemistry they had. What a classic!!

183,pitch_perfect,critics,rotten,n,"The multitude of references to [""The Breakfast Club""] backfires in a major way, but it's a worthwhile lesson to burgeoning filmmakers - don't invoke John Hughes. Don't."

191,pitch_perfect,audience,5.0,p,"phenomenal, a literal pice of art"
192,pitch_perfect,audience,4.0,p,"Pitch Perfect is an excellent movie overall. It contains enjoyable acapella scenes (similar to choreographed musicals) and an easy-to-understand/logical plotline. However, the film is somewhat predictable, and the ending seemed rushed, thus detracting from its overall score."

199,pitch_perfect,audience,2.0,n,"Supposed to be comedy but I didnt laugh once. The corners of my mouth may have risen slightly in some parts. The characters and storyline are all so cliched and the singing so ""pitch perfect"" that this just comes over as one big cheese fest.

1,great_dictator,critics,fresh,p,Though The Great Dictator provides a good many laughs [it] merits serious consideration for the superior presentation of the message it is trying to put across to that part of the world where democracy is still a precious possession.
2,great_dictator,critics,fresh,p,"More than the expected assemblage of skits, the film attempts to tell a grander, straightforward story, but utilizes too many subplots in the process."
3,great_dictator,critics,fresh,p,"The Great Dictator (1940) is director/actor Charlie Chaplin's first full all-talking (""talkie"" with dialogue) picture (in a film similar to the Marx Brothers' anti-war comedy Duck Soup (1933)) in which he delivered spoken lines..."

5,great_dictator,critics,fresh,p,The Great Dictator may have been a bold piece of satirical storytelling at the time but the film has aged like fine wine.

8,great_dictator,critics,rotten,n,The only trouble is that such perfect scenes as this are followed by more conventional passages which would be funny enough in an average picture but let one down in a film that deals so ambitiously with so great a theme.
9,great_dictator,critics,fresh,p,"...a great movie because it works as a film, and because it is a document of courage and faith, the prime exhibit in Chaplin's humanist brief ... Dictator is a comedy, the work of a clown, but it is no joke. Chaplin had lethal intent."

Artistry in a time of crisis
The Great Dictator

I would rate this movie a 4.5, it is a true form of artistry expressed in a comical triumph. Chaplin's expression through the film carries a strong entertaining, ""unoffensive message"" through history. Chaplin's display of Hitler in regards to a tramp plays on his anti-Semitic policies as dictator, it was an informative piece because at the time crisis was unknown to many. This movie broke barrier in the film industry it was a gateway for filmmaker to express political and social statements, it was easy for Chaplin to do this because he had the financial capabilities and his own studio even though there was must resistance Chaplin remained fearless. It shows that artistry and film and movies will never remain timeless. A great movie and groundbreaking film marking history and theatrics."
21,great_dictator,audience,4.5,p,"The first talkie of Charlie Chaplin came to the big screen as an immense success in 1940 as a satire of fascist regimes focusing on the Germany of Hitler. With this film, Chaplin managed to impact with his humor while he was reporting a situation in which many people were living at that time. 

The movie's main characters are a Jewish barber from Tomania and the dictator Adenoid Hynkel, both interpreted by the director, writer, producer, and music composer Charles Chaplin. At the beginning of the film, the Jewish barber during the First World War saves the life of the official Schultz (Reginald Gardiner), but they suffer a plane accident, and the Jewish man starts to suffer amnesia in the hospital. After twenty years he escapes from the hospital, and he goes back to his ghetto without knowing that now a dictator that looks like him is ruling the country and they discriminate against Jewish and dark hair people. 

This movie was filmed in 1939, the year in which Second World War started when Germans invaded Poland, and released one year after in 1940. The movie was banned in several countries because of the topics treated, for example in Germany and territories invaded by them, but in the U.S was well received. 

Chaplin criticizes the abuse of power and the discrimination of other people; we can see that social issue in Napoleon Dynamite because ""superior"" students used to bully Napoleon because he was different from them. Also, both movies at the end transmit a feeling of hope, Napoleon by being recognized by their classmates when he dances, and with the last speech of Chaplin about equality, democracy, and freedom. 

Chaplin was one of the first directors that hazarded to use comedy to make a social and political critic. He uses a lot of slapstick in his movies proving that humor is not only based on used jokes, but comedy can also be silent and visual. However, between all those comedic moments, he managed to surprise us with his encouraging speech and the amazing final shots of Hanna (Paulette Goddard). It was also characteristic of Chaplin his ability to stare at the camera and support his acting with the feelings transmitted through his gaze. 

In conclusion, The Great Dictator is one of the best films by Charlie Chaplin, the message behind the whole movie, the hilarious humor, and the great characterization makes the movie worth it, I would recommend it without a doubt."
22,great_dictator,audience,5.0,p,"The Great Dictator is a film that was directed and written by Charlie Chaplin, who stars in the film as both Adenoid Hynkel and as a Jewish barber. The film also stars Paulette Goddard as Hannah and Jack Oakie as Napaloni and was produced by Charlie Chaplin and Carter DeHaven. The movie is a political satire that provides commentary about world affairs at the beginning of World War II. 
The film was released in 1940 and follows the stories of Adenoid Hynkel, the dictator of Tomania who clearly represents Hitler, and a Jewish barber, both played by Chaplin. The film highlights Hynkel's absurdity and deep insecurities, while showing the terrifying scope of his public influence. The film concludes with a case of mistaken identity as the Barber and Hynkel are mistaken for one another, and the Barber delivers a controversial speech that remains chillingly relevant today. 
Production highlights include Meredith Wilson's musical score and Chaplin's masterful acting as he jumps back and forth between the roles of Hynkel and the Barber. Chaplin collaborated immensely with Wilson to create a beautiful classical score where the music matches the on-screen movement perfectly, especially during scenes of silent physical comedy, and the film was nominated for the Best Original Score Academy Award in 1941. Chaplin is committed and convincing in each of his dual roles and the viewer is easily able to differentiate between the two characters, even when other characters in the story begin to mix them up. Chaplin's ability to jump back and forth between such two such opposite characters and inhabit both so completely is evidence of his artistic brilliance.   
It was risky for Chaplin to make The Great Dictator because of its divisive political content, but Chaplin did not shy away from the opportunity to use his platform to enact social change. When Chaplin began writing the script in 1938, he did not know if the US or Britain would even allow his movie to play in theaters due to the film industry's hesitation to get involved politically, but he persevered because he understood the potential impact of his message. In the final scene of the film, Chaplin seems to break character and gives a heartfelt call to action speech, directed not only at the fictional audience in front of him but at the viewer. In 1940, when the film was released, the United States had not yet become involved in World War II. Chaplin urges the US to abandon its isolationist stance in his concluding speech, calling for unity to create a free and democratic future. Chaplin's words were relevant in their original temporal context and remain so to this day. 
The Great Dictator was Charlie Chaplin's first movie with sound and is different from a typical commercial movie because of its combination of the slapstick physical comedy of the silent film era with the realism found in films of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Much of the film's exaggerated physical comedy occurs in silence with nondiegetic classical music, such as a scene where Hynkel and Napaloni, the Bacterian dictator, compete to see who can elevate their barber stools the highest. Hyperbolic actions such as Hynkel climbing halfway up the curtains of his office remind the viewer of the movie's fictional nature and act as a buffer to the horrors of the fascist regime. 

I highly recommend The Great Dictator because of the way it reflects the historical climate of the time and for its uncanny ability to sense the future. The film foreshadows World War II without yet understanding the full scale of events to come and, although moderately uncomfortable to watch in hindsight, The Great Dictator is a must-see. Like the 2004 comedy Napoleon Dynamite, Chaplin uses comedy as a means of delivering serious social commentary, masterfully masking a serious political film beneath a comedic veil to examine the highly controversial political climate of the late 1930s and early 1940s. Chaplin implores audience members to follow his lead and take action, sending a timeless message of universal unity that, while it was too late to stop the horrors of World War II, may help us avoid similar global calamities in the future."
23,great_dictator,audience,5.0,p,"The Great Dictator Review
The film The Great Dictator, directed by and starring Charlie Chaplin tells the story of a Jewish Barber living under the role of a fascist dictator. The story is clearly meant to address what was happening in Nazi Germany as it was released in 1940. The film is a great example of how comedy can highlight social issues and address how terrible they are while also working to brighten a person's day. The film addresses the disgusting action of Hitter while expressing them in a palatable fashion. This film shows the power of comedy as it shared the atrocities of Nazi Germany in a way where people could watch and understand it. Often with a story as sad as what happened in Germany in the World War 2 it is hard for people to watch as it is so putting it in a satirical context allows for people to comprehend how terrible what was going on while still paying attention. Often, when faced with hard issues people are quick to avoid the subject by infusing these hard issues with comic relief just as Charlie Chaplin did. The fact that Chaplin played both the dictator as well as the Jewish man he is suppressing serves as a great cinematic device to show how the two men against each other are the same. It subtly expresses that although the dictator thinks he is above others just as Hitler did, he is not. The same concept is expressed in Do the Right Thing where the director Spike Lee where it is highlighted that people constantly think they are above others and where the uniqueness of everyone should be celebrated it instead divides the characters. These films show how comedy can be used to address pressing issues. The fact that this film was shot in 1940 and still expressed how terrible the Nazi's where helping inform people in the US what was going on in Europe. The film is an amazing example of how comedy can be used for more than just making a person laugh. The film The Great Dictator is an amazing film that touches on complex issues while still being easy to watch I would absolutely recommend watching it."

25,great_dictator,audience,4.0,p,"The movie is a good comedy, with a deep story related to its time.
Basically, the script and enjoyable performances make ""The Great Dictator"" an important (and really good) film."
26,great_dictator,audience,3.5,p,"One of Chaplin's best. Moved to the speakies effortlessly. Half serious half comedy, well executed. Historically fascinating as it was a film from 1940 that clearly showed that the world knew the plight of the Jews but the US in particular were happy to turn a blind eye to it and feign surprise when the horrors of the Holocaust were shown on film post War. It's a telling film for that alone."

28,great_dictator,audience,5.0,p,This film is a good critique of racism and reminds us that all human beings are equal in rights.
29,great_dictator,audience,4.5,p,"Parts of The Great Dictator come off as a tad naïve in an era where the horrors of the Holocaust are general knowledge, but the Charlie Chaplin comedy still manages to bring forth laughter while remaining sensitive to the atrocities committed by the Nazis. Indeed, it is the very precariousness of this balancing act which makes the film memorable, a high-wire stunt Chaplin pulls it off with the skill of a trained acrobat."

This isn't a parody/comedy that will appeal to all, as it is often dreadful to watch at times. That doesn't eliminate some of its good, laughable moments though. A few chuckles were let out from me, but other than that, this isn't a film I'd watch again. Nonetheless, it can be rather enjoyable or completely lackluster depending on the scene. Not all humor lands. -Fennett"

However, I am someone who has seen almost none of the movies that it parodies and I still had such a fun time watching this. I guess it is just my style of humor, because I was laughing at most of the jokes and gags, and each character has at least one funny and memorable scene/line. It's just the dumb high school guy that still lives in me that loves this humor, but anytime I watch this with a friend or group of friends we all walk away with a smile on our faces. This movie is far better than many of the other spoofs out there, and I give it a 4/5 because it never fails to make me laugh"

There is a lot of inappropriate language and references to drugs. There is a part where an eating disorder is discussed and laughed about as though it is a good thing.

83,zoolander,audience,4.0,p,"Ignore the critics, this film is a total hoot!"
84,zoolander,audience,3.5,p,"It's that rarest of beasts, another selection being screened on Comedy Central. But also, arguably the best collaboration between Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson bar Starsky & Hutch (2004). Zoolander is a sharp satire on the fashion industry, with the usual nonsense you might expect from such a cast list. But it's genuinely funny, hilariously conceived, and, just like Starksy & Hutch, has an excellent performance from Will Ferrell. I haven't yet seen the sequel, but I've been told to avoid it. If you've got an opinion on it, let me know!"
85,zoolander,audience,3.5,p,"When the leader of Malaysia bans the exploitation of children in the workforce, in order to save the fashion industry from an exorbitant increase in production costs, fashion mogul Mugatu (Will Ferrell) is forced to program obtuse Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) to kill the Malaysian when he visits New York.  Written, directed and produced (and probably catered) by Stiller, there are plenty of laughs generated from the outlandish characters and the equally absurd plot.  Granted, Derek Zoolander's stupidity can only be milked for so much humor and it might get a bit tiresome for some, but the energy is consistent throughout.  As an added bonus, the number of guest cameos is staggering and will at least give those who don't appreciate the humor the opportunity to do some star gazing."

134,clerks,critics,fresh,p,...the film's inherent deficiencies are generally overshadowed by the distinctly earnest vibe.
135,clerks,critics,fresh,p,
136,clerks,critics,fresh,p,"Smith dogpiles absurdity and obscenity on top of each other. The dullness of the dead-end jobs is brightened by bizarre bits--a fat guy asking for softer toilet paper, drops dead on the toilet."

138,clerks,critics,fresh,p,Kevin Smith actually pulled it off.
139,clerks,critics,fresh,p,"Hilariously funny and very, very rude."
140,clerks,audience,1.0,n,Massively overrated. There must have been a lot of bad movies this year.
141,clerks,audience,4.5,p,A true reflection of the ennui at a dead-end job.
142,clerks,audience,0.5,n,"Recently watched it again. Hated it then, and it's even worse now. How all the careers that came from this pile of shit happened in an fucking mindfuck in itself. If the kid wasn't a kid when he made it, nothing would have ever come of this garbage."
143,clerks,audience,4.5,p,"I love the way it jumps around from the guy trying to get people to stop smoking cigarettes to Jay & Bob outside smoking lol. This is really clever writing. And fucking hilarious. Some of the acting and delivery of lines is kind of lackluster at times. But I get it. It's an indie film made on a shoestring budget with some of Smith's friends so it gets a pass. I'm ok with it. Although sometimes it feels like the actors aren't really having a conversation that feels genuine, it seems like it's two actors who have memorized lines and are trying to quickly read out the lines. 

It is genuinely funny. The actors actually have great comedy chops. Filled with a cheeky and randomly funny style of humor. And delivered in a quick sharp and witty manner. I love how the cat takes a shit on the counter in the litter box right in front of the customer and the guys just baffled that he just witnessed a cat taking a shit in front of him in a convenience store. Lmao! 

It surprised me at how well it works as a really good case on human character study and society. I love it when a movie surprises me with how good and filled with depth it is. It definitely grew on me. It brought me many joy and laughs and also served as an interesting outlook on life. I think what Kevin Smith and his friends were able to accomplish with this movie is something very special and admirable and something they should definitely be proud of. It's not perfect by any means but it sure is a damn good funny movie. I'd totally watch it again."

145,clerks,audience,3.0,p,"Perhaps a little outdated, Clerks is still fun nonetheless."
146,clerks,audience,3.5,p,"Clerks is hugely crude, lewd, and may not be to everyones taste, but it is fantastically well written, and, imperatively, funny. Kevin Smith's cheap-as-hell debut feature will strike a note with anyone who has worked in retail, and proves a surprisingly nostalgic viewing experience with many scenes set in an old video rental store. These days it's a cult classic, but back in '94 it was raw, and seemed to set up a career of excellence for Smith, promise which he sadly hasn't really built on. Clerks is still his best, and it's very good."
147,clerks,audience,3.5,p,Can't believe it took me so long to watch this movie.

151,tootsie,critics,fresh,p,"[Hoffman gives] a remarkable dual performance, as profound as it is funny."
152,tootsie,critics,fresh,p,"Tootsie (1982) is an engaging, original, hilarious gender-comedy story of an unemployed actor Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) whose disguises as a feminist named ""Dorothy"" fooled his/her co-actors and helped him get a job and become a female star"
153,tootsie,critics,fresh,p,Tootsie is a brilliant and intelligent movie that can interest the public because of its originality. [Full Review in Spanish]
154,tootsie,critics,fresh,p,"Both [Garr and Lange] are excellent, and Miss Lange continues her promise to become a superstar of the 1980s."
155,tootsie,critics,fresh,p,"Shadow-boxing his way downtown, Dorsey suddenly yells, ""I'm a great character actor; I can play anybody!"" In Tootsie, Hoffman proves that he just about can."
156,tootsie,critics,fresh,p,It's a movie with a lot on its mind - while never toppling over under the weight of its good intentions.
157,tootsie,critics,fresh,p,"Tootsie's finely balanced writing is one of the film's greatest strengths, being consistently funny without ever turning the central premise into a gag."
158,tootsie,critics,fresh,p,"What makes Tootsie a smart, enduring comedy instead of a silly, momentary one is its real sympathy for women."
159,tootsie,critics,fresh,p,"a wonderful movie, full of warmth and good humor balanced with both farcical silliness and level-headed recognition of certain social truths about the sexes we often want to ignore"
160,tootsie,critics,fresh,p,A comedy of surprisingly refined class for 1982...
161,tootsie,critics,fresh,p,Touching romantic comedy with a twist.
162,tootsie,critics,fresh,p,"Hoffman is magnificent in his dual role, though it's Bill Murray who stealthily steals scenes."
163,tootsie,critics,fresh,p,
164,tootsie,critics,fresh,p,It is not just the best comedy of the year; it is popular art on the way to becoming cultural artifact.
165,tootsie,critics,rotten,n,I found this polished sitcom comedy to be a drag.
166,tootsie,critics,fresh,p,A sparkling turn by Hoffman and an absolutely fabulous cast make this a risk -- and a risque -- success.
167,tootsie,critics,fresh,p,"Pollack's easy-going, gender-bending comedy seems to have grown in stature and reputation with age, and it is not difficult to see why."
168,tootsie,critics,fresh,p,"The film is mostly remembered for Dustin Hoffman's outstanding portrayal of Dorothy, the bespectacled, conservative woman who stands for neither discrimination nor nonsense"
169,tootsie,critics,fresh,p,...an amiable and frequently hilarious comedy that boasts one of the most effective performances of Hoffman's career.
170,tootsie,audience,3.5,p,"The writing is sharp, the performances are ridiculously good, most of the jokes hit and under it all is a message about gender roles, and why they are dumb. The way the movie goes about its message is slightly outdated, and not all the jokes hit, but overall, this is an enduring classic. 7/10"
171,tootsie,audience,3.5,p,I love all three top women in the Movie and that includes Dustin Hoffman.
172,tootsie,audience,5.0,p,"Dustin Hoffman is the greatest actor of all-time! The Graduate, Midnight Cowboy, Kramer vs. Kramer, Tootsie and Rain Man prove the above statement."
173,tootsie,audience,5.0,p,"I loved this film as a kid. Adored it. Now I see it for how absolutely problematic it is, and I still love it. The idea that Hoffman could pass and shock everyone when he rips off his wig is hilarious! As a child I was like ""Totally legit. This happens ALL the time."" 

Just the idea: A PG comedy about a man who can't get work as a man, so he dresses up like a woman to teach women how to be strong women, is so 80s male empowerment!"
174,tootsie,audience,5.0,p,This made Dustin Hoffman my favorite movie star.
175,tootsie,audience,4.0,p,"I don't know if the great Billy Wilder had the chance to watch this, but in case he didn't, he would've been proud. There's so much of his comedic style and feel-goodness all over.

Superb acting, such a funny and good script, Dustin Hoffman killing it, Bill Murray being Bill Murray, Jessica Lange being sexy and cool (although I don't get her winning the Oscar for her supporting role). Had a great time. 

Fun fact: When I was a kid I remember walking through the Blockbuster isles and seeing this VHS on the shelves. Although the cover always got my attention, I never rented the movie because I thought it was a boring political biopic, but hell, I wasn't even close."

177,tootsie,audience,4.5,p,An absloute blast with great performances from Dustin Hoffman and Jessica Lange. a very touching and awkward at times (in a funny way) movie.
178,tootsie,audience,1.0,n,Terrible boring movie starring Dustin Hoffman.
179,tootsie,audience,3.5,p,The big reveal had me in stitches. Managed to eventually overcome the obvious jokes to be quite a funny film. The problem was the ridiculously unrealistic ending. That aside the film works as a gentle candy floss piece of silly cinema.
180,borat,critics,rotten,n,"In the tactics of Cohen, Charles and their collaborators ... there is a level of social insularity, sneering and intellectual sadism that is positively disturbing."
181,borat,critics,fresh,p,"Borat is funny, spleen-bursting funny, although you may catch yourself wondering if these are the kind of jokes you should be laughing at."
182,borat,critics,fresh,p,"It wallows gleefully in its very un-PC humor, but that is part of what makes it work so well. Cohen and director Larry Charles make the unthinkable funny -- and in the process might just get you to think about racism, bigotry and sexism."
183,borat,critics,fresh,p,"A gut-busting, uncompromising, totally outrageous film that takes the comedy of embarrassment to new, unprecedented levels."
184,borat,critics,fresh,p,"Offensive? Yes, but I haven't laughed this hard since the Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy."
185,borat,critics,fresh,p,"For better or for worse, Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is unique, an important movie, a multiplex comedy that doubles as a conceptual art epic."
186,borat,critics,fresh,p,"Borat... is a not only a very good comedy but is also an interesting sociological experiment as to how numerous individuals in the USA would respond to a man such as Borat, and often the reactions are interesting and vastly entertaining."
187,borat,critics,fresh,p,"Frequently uproarious and occasionally side-splitting -- but it's very hit-or-miss, prone to stretches of unnecessary crudeness and flat one-liners."
188,borat,critics,fresh,p,Often functions hilariously as an exposé of squirming American tolerance shading into condescension toward the rest of the world
189,borat,critics,fresh,p,Borat is the rare comedy that operates without a safety net. Cohen and director Larry Charles' film provides constant laughter and surprises while daring the viewer to be rightfully offended.
190,borat,critics,fresh,p,"Although I knew it was dishonest, cynical, and the ultimate in cheap-shot humor, I laughed more at Borat than at any other film this year. So I guess the joke is on me."
191,borat,critics,fresh,p,"Borat's cultural learning is revealing, even if it doesn't adequately convey how it benefits glorious nation of Kazakhstan."
192,borat,critics,fresh,p,Borat is the funniest film imaginable right now.
193,borat,critics,fresh,p,"The most impressive ingredient is Cohen, whose inflection and timing are dead-on as he negotiates a vague accent, a native language composed of gibberish and a sprinkling of Polish, and a way of making tired American jokes funny again."
194,borat,critics,fresh,p,"America, you got punk'd and the result is horrifying. Borat paints a picture of the American landscape that would induce nightmares were you not laughing so hard."
195,borat,critics,fresh,p,The backlash just proves how deep a nerve the faux Kazakh journalist has hit.
196,borat,critics,fresh,p,"A rude punk-rock snapshot of an America that quails at two men kissing but cheers the notion of George W. Bush drinking the blood of 'every man, woman and child in Iraq.'"
197,borat,critics,fresh,p,"By the end, you're eager to wrap things up. Along the way, though, Borat is a helluva ride."
198,borat,critics,fresh,p,"Like great theatre, Borat holds up a mirror to its obliviously intolerant audience ... that serves as a shocking, but entertaining wake-up call."

201,borat,audience,4.5,p,"Crude, rude, and absolutely hilarious. I actually had to pause the DVD several times because I was laughing too hard. Watch this if you want to be both offended and entertained."
202,borat,audience,2.5,n,"There are better ways to spend an hour and 20 minutes.  It was very funny for about 30 or 40 of those 80 minutes, but the rest of the time it was a slog to get through.  Just because a movie's culturally important or relevant doesn't mean it has to be good, per se, and Borat demonstrates that."
203,borat,audience,4.0,p,Fucking hilarious and genuinely one of the best comedies I've seen.
204,borat,audience,3.0,p,"""Borat"" is over the laughs, it's an invention between funniest jokes and disgusting humor made by Sacha Baron Cohen. 6/10"

206,borat,audience,3.5,p,"some pretty funny moments, but when watched it I didn't pick up all the humor"
207,borat,audience,3.5,p,"Decent comedy, has some hit or miss jokes."
208,borat,audience,5.0,p,This Movie is the best thing to ever happen to cinema
209,borat,audience,4.5,p,"This has to be one of the most outrageous films ever made, and honestly, it's pretty great. For all its silliness it's actually pretty clever really. It mightn't hold up on repeat viewings as much as I would hope, but a solid politically incorrect comedy nonetheless with a fantastic performance by Sacha Baron Cohen."

1,annie_hall,critics,rotten,n,I know that it is an exaggerated character for comedic effect in the movie but I really have lost all my patience for it.
2,annie_hall,critics,fresh,p,"Simple in story, complex in construction, and unquestionably innovative in style."
3,annie_hall,critics,fresh,p,"[Woody Allen's] most recognizable film, the one that he is most associated with."
4,annie_hall,critics,fresh,p,"""Annie Hall"" isn't a conventional rom-com but a very accurate and bittersweet depiction of the dynamics of relationships, tinged with Allen's melancholic personality, and made to go down easier than it normally would, due to his world-class humor."
5,annie_hall,critics,fresh,p,"...a style that was at once realistic, deeply personal, and still full of energy and humor."
6,annie_hall,critics,fresh,p,[Woody Allen] has miraculously made his most personal film his funniest.
7,annie_hall,critics,fresh,p,"Keaton's own mannerisms-like her congenital inability to utter a complete sentence-can be irritating, she is able to provide a character of full dimensions, with a base of feeling and need that allows Annie Hall to be as moving as it is merry."
8,annie_hall,critics,fresh,p,Annie Hall is as good as it is because its comedy is always on the brink of the minor tragedies of real life and love.
9,annie_hall,critics,fresh,p,The best film Woody Allen has ever made.
10,annie_hall,critics,fresh,p,"Romantic, honest, and touching - all the kinds of things one wants from a smart rom-com that refuses to be guided by the genre's tropes."
11,annie_hall,critics,fresh,p,"Woody Allen has outdone himself. If Annie Hall is any indication, he has grown as a filmmaker; his latest movie displays far greater discipline and completeness than any past work."
12,annie_hall,critics,fresh,p,"Clearly a deeply personal work for Allen, almost autobiographical in its evocation of his worldview."
13,annie_hall,critics,fresh,p,"Annie Hall may be 40 years old this year, but it still holds up as a great romantic comedy, that is simultaneously hilarious, sweet, and at times unexpectedly sad."
14,annie_hall,critics,fresh,p,Annie Hall is a great step forward in the already brilliant career of Woody Allen. [Full Review in Spanish]
15,annie_hall,critics,rotten,n,"A soft, fuzzy, mildly diverting letdown."
16,annie_hall,critics,fresh,p,"Woody Allen fans will buy it 100%. Never before has the diminutive comedian been so urbane, so open - so funny. And with lovely Diane Keaton as consort, it becomes well-nigh irresistible (especially if you find Keaton as well-nigh irresistible as I do)."
17,annie_hall,critics,fresh,p,"Allen tosses out the usual romantic comedy conventions for his own brand of humor, but under the gags and self-effacing jokes is the portrait of two people who fall in love and then... fall out of love."
18,annie_hall,critics,fresh,p,"Allen's imaginative, often avant-garde approach to the material goes a long way towards compensating for a decidedly uneven atmosphere..."
19,annie_hall,critics,fresh,p,"I think It's his best picture so far, and I hope that audiences will enjoy his drily aggressive, despairingly narcissistic humour as much as I did."
20,annie_hall,audience,5.0,p,"The only thing that is necessary to say here, is that it is absurd this film doesn't boast a 100% Fresh grading. Not that Rotten Tomatoes means jack shit to an artist, or anyone. However, in this sad, internet, disconnected world of false reality, lack of creativity, and an overall malaise, it is easy to understand how some morons might come to this page in modern times, and give it anything less than what it deserves. Which is 100%. This is a groundbreaking film that changed the way interpersonal stories were told in America, giving birth to a whole new genre and style. Woody Allen is the greatest American writer/director, and his films are the most re-watchable films ever made."
21,annie_hall,audience,3.0,p,"This Woody Allen film sees him playing a comedian as we go through the span of his relationship with Annie Hall, played by Diane Keaton.  Typical Allen flick with a lot of pontificating and trying to figure out why his relationships ultimately end abruptly. 
Always witty, though slightly dated, it's always a joy to put on a Woody Allen film and just get lost in his problems."
22,annie_hall,audience,5.0,p,"Annie Hall has an essential impact on cinema of all time. Woody Allen's masterpiece is as innovative as it is funny, and has one of the best screenplays of all time. Allen's innovation goes beyond the cinema of humor, and sets standards in the filmic structure of many subsequent films, a benchmark in the romantic comedy genre that can only be compared to the effect of Citizen Kane and Vertigo on the structure of cinema of all time. The comedy uses language tools such as breaking the fourth wall, a non-linear narrative, and satirizes the exaggerations of urban life and relationships in general. A masterpiece of cinema and my favorite film of all time!"
23,annie_hall,audience,1.5,n,It's not that great movie.....what it had achieved....in this movie...Woody Allen... talking like a robot....lots of dialogue...in a romantic movie... that's unfair...there was no art in cinematography....the strength of this movie is screenplay...not more than that...no director's art stamp in this movie...after all it didn't deserve Oscar...but back then...there were lots of dark comedies in Academy... it's not 100% pure..back then....
24,annie_hall,audience,5.0,p,This is a fantastic work of art. I absolutely loved it and it is a 100% must see for film buffs.
25,annie_hall,audience,4.0,p,Extremely witty and relatable social commentary on relationships. Made in the 70s but still applicable to contemporary relationships.
26,annie_hall,audience,4.0,p,"Of the handful of Woody's movies that I've seen this is certainly the funniest, with some of the best one-liner jokes I've heard in a movie -- my wife in particular got a belly laugh from the joke about bad vibes. This was very well-rounded in that it had a great cast, screenplay, characters and cinematography but some of the parts seen as all-time great like Keaton's performance and the level of comedy have been eclipsed by later movies that most certainly did it better, similar to how 2000's X-Men was a great superhero movie that's been improved upon as the genre grew. Surely this movie was the inspiration for later greatness like When Harry Met Sally, where Sally is a far more interesting & quirky lady than Annie is in this movie. While this is the best of Woody's movies that I've seen I still prefer his later work where they're plot-driven instead of character-focused as the ones where he plays the romantic lead come off as narcissistic sometimes, and he provides himself better opportunities for jokes when there's a fresh & intricate plot to draw from. I can only hope that one of his plot-driven movies is as good in that category as this one is for rom-coms. Anyway, a great-but-not-excellent viewing experience!"
27,annie_hall,audience,1.0,n,This movie sucked. Movie is only rated high because Woody Allen made it.  Not a very memorable movie.
28,annie_hall,audience,5.0,p,A hilarious script uplifted by Woody Allen's signature direction and a charming performance from Diane Keaton made Annie Hall a classic.
29,annie_hall,audience,4.5,p,"Commedia tra le migliori del regista; che con la sua solita autoironia e la sua musa Diane Keaton, sfodera un gioiello per la piacevolezza e la leggerezza con cui si guarda il tutto.
Il tratto distintivo rispetto a tante altre commedie di Woody Allen, è che oltre all'ironia, viene rappresentata una storia vera, credibile ed in cui tante persone si possono rivedere; un tratto che troppo poco, negli anni successivi, è stato esplorato dal regista."
30,caddyshack,critics,fresh,p,Still demonstrates an eye for superb comedic timing.
31,caddyshack,critics,fresh,p,"""Caddyshack"" is an above average example of the over-inflated B-movie gag film genre because of its expert performances."
32,caddyshack,critics,rotten,n,Should have put the gopher to work on the script.
33,caddyshack,critics,fresh,p,"The humor in this film is very high-yield. I laughed and laughed, even when I probably shouldn't have."
34,caddyshack,critics,rotten,n,"Brian Doyle-Murray (Bill's brother) teamed with Harold Ramls and Douglas Kenney as the authors, and Ramis directed. By now, all certainly should have outgrown their sophomoric tendencies but viewing the film makes one wonder."
35,caddyshack,critics,fresh,p,"I love the madness in this film. It celebrates the triumph of the underdogs, the eccentrics and even the downright dangerous."
36,caddyshack,critics,fresh,p,Harold Ramis' directorial debut may be messy at times but Caddyshack's zany moments are enough to overcome the faults.
37,caddyshack,critics,rotten,n,Caddyshack represents everything that is wrong with contemporary film comedy.
38,caddyshack,critics,fresh,p,Caddyshack has a low-budget look that warmly welcomes the all-important teenage audience.
39,caddyshack,critics,rotten,n,To attempt a critical evaluation of Orion's new Caddyshack is a little like describing the esthetic qualities of an outhouse.
40,caddyshack,critics,fresh,p,"Essentially Animal House on the links, it's neither as raucous nor as outrageous as that definitive college comedy but it has the same rebellious spirit and a great cast of comedy legends showing the young co-stars how it's done."
41,caddyshack,critics,fresh,p,"There is a plot to this enjoyably erratic comedy... But basically it's a framework on which the writers, two of whom (Harold Ramis and Douglas Kenney) are Animal House alumni, can hang vulgar, obvious, yet often amusing gags."
42,caddyshack,critics,rotten,n,"Caddyshack, a derelict farce that lurches about in search of hilarious possibilities among the members and employes of a country club, is the latest misbegotten spawn of National Lampoon's Animal House."
43,caddyshack,critics,fresh,p,"There's still a lot of fun in this movie, and most of that comes from the heartfelt performances from the cast."
44,caddyshack,critics,fresh,p,"A funny slapstick comedy, starring Billy Murray in top form"
45,caddyshack,critics,fresh,p,Classic '80s comedy; not for kids.
46,caddyshack,critics,fresh,p,"Never mind the fact that the plot regularly goes off track and into the rough, Caddyshack offers laughs a plenty."
47,caddyshack,critics,rotten,n,dependant almost entirely--when it's not being angry and cynical--on arrogance and smugness.
48,caddyshack,critics,fresh,p,"Given the short shelf life of many rude 'n' crude Hollywood comedies, it's amazing how well Caddyshack stands up after all these years."
49,caddyshack,critics,fresh,p,"Despite being ungainly, Caddyshack is the kind of comedy you can pan for gold in... [Blu-ray]"
50,caddyshack,audience,4.0,p,"At the time of release, no film had ever pushed the envelope of crude humor like this one.  Having emerged from SNL with success, Bill Murray and Chevy Chase were in their prime.  Their ability to riff one liners and develop side splitting characters made Caddyshack one of the most quotable films of all time."
51,caddyshack,audience,5.0,p,A sports film classic. Unforgettable performances by an all star cast. Check it out even if you don't care about golf.
52,caddyshack,audience,5.0,p,Another 80s classic. Just as hilarious as Ferris Buller. 5/5
53,caddyshack,audience,3.0,p,The best thing about this movie is the ground squirrel or gopher if you prefer!!!
54,caddyshack,audience,4.0,p,"There are certain movies that are considered classics and Caddyshack is up there in the comedy genre of the 80's.  Directed by Harold Ramis, this film about a misfit bunch of caddies and members at the prestigious Bushwood country club boasts an eclectic cast with SNL alumni, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray along with Ted Knight, Rodney Dangerfield and Michael O'Keefe.  No matter how many times I see this it still makes me laugh and is always a fantastic revisit."
55,caddyshack,audience,2.0,n,"Another hugely overrated 80's comedy that feels more like one of those ""I guess you had to be there"" jokes, since this movie must have been much funnier when it was put out. Can someone please explain to me who the protagonist is, or is this just a world where everyone is varying degrees of asshole? That's not how good storytelling works. I guess people in the 80's weren't too worried about someone's redeeming qualities."
56,caddyshack,audience,5.0,p,A certified comedy classic.
57,caddyshack,audience,4.5,p,"All time classic. If you weren't born yet when this movie came out, you gotta watch Bill Murray at his best."
58,caddyshack,audience,4.5,p,Harold Ramis directing Bill Murray & Rodney Dangerfield = guaranteed consistent laughs and great story. I'd like to know how much that genius even had to direct those giants. Yeah Chevy's great too.
59,caddyshack,audience,5.0,p,A classic where some of the very best comedic actors around all bring out their A-game for one of the funniest movies ever.

67,idiocracy,critics,fresh,p,"The whole film has a drab, somnambulant rhythm. Intentional or not, this is part of its genius."

80,idiocracy,audience,2.5,n,"One of my late father's favorite stories was C. M. Kornbluth's 1951 novella ""The Marching Morons"", about a man who is accidentally put into suspended animation and is brought out 500 years later, to find a messy Earth heavily overrun by moronic humans while a comparatively small group of human geniuses is busy trying to hold society together. The reason things got that way because the dumber people were having most of the babies while the smart ones were having fewer.

The same idea is brought up here, with an Army private and a prostitute being used for an experiment where they are purposely put into suspended animation. But in this case, the experiment goes awry and they end up waking 500 years into the future, being accidentally revived by a garbage tsunami. The world is futuristic but decaying and full of huge amounts of garbage, and there are no human geniuses, only highly advanced technology and computer programs that the humans are barely able to use. Corporations are now very powerful-but it matters little because the whole world is so messy anyway, with humans unable to grow their own food.

The future humans are vacuous and naive and speak very slowly, and the sudden presence of the private and the prostitute knocks them for a loop-especially when they are smarter than everyone else in the world. There is mention of a ""time machine""...but how do they get back to it to return to their own time? And perhaps they might even be able to solve the mess humanity is currently in? The satire is too broad to have a real impact. The stupid people enjoy very lowbrow entertainment and consume unhealthy food, and assume plants need Gatorade and not water because water is used for toilets and plants need minerals-which is why the plants aren't growing.

Why didn't this film get promoted? Quite probably because of the movie's implication that people who enjoy lowbrow entertainment and aren't highly educated are inherently stupid. The truth of course is that some highly educated people really do like lowbrow entertainment, and even geniuses can be stupid and imperceptive. Just ask Robert MacNamara, the boy wonder...and inventor of the Ford Edsel, a high-tech car that proved to be an expensive design failure."

Es una obra que acumula adverbios adjetivales. Es la mayor película de Tati, la más compleja, la mejor lograda y, a la vez, es la más difícil de ver.

Rodada en 1967 este es el cuarto largometraje (quinto filme si se toma en cuenta su primer corto de 1947) de este gran artista que decidió filmarla en 70mm, un tamaño gigantesco de fotograma que podía apreciarse solamente en un puñado de salas que contaran con pantallas y proyectores acordes. Esta decisión estética (funesta desde el punto de vista financiero) buscaba resaltar hasta sus últimas consecuencias y hasta el más mínimo detalle las decenas de gags simultáneos que ocurren en una complejísima coreografía de protagonistas, extras, vehículos y gigantescos decorados construidos en acero y vidrio. Ningún ambiente utilizó locaciones exteriores, absolutamente todo se fabricó a escala en estudios. La multitud de vehículos —automóviles, autobuses, camiones, motocicletas, maquinaria vial— fueron movidos con una precisión milimétrica de relojero en ensayos que fueron tan extenuantes que resultó en la producción más cara en la historia del cine francés, y también en la ruina económica de su creador.

La capacidad inigualable de Tati para mover personajes y objetos en primeros, segundos, terceros y últimos planos en la misma toma hace que ""Playtime"" sea, además de una obra maestra, una película abrumadora e inabarcable para ver una sola vez.

Lo ideal sería saber francés para no perder atención en subtítulos, e igualmente la mayoría de las secuencias requieren rebobinar para ver una y otra vez la misma escena y así poder apreciar las sutilezas que se encadenan unas a otras en una sucesión interminable de causas y efectos. Sumándole el genial manejo del sonido con la amplificación de los ruidos ambientales, incluso de aquellos fuera de cuadro, debe reconocerse que hay momentos en que el espectador queda desconcertado y algo cansado.

Por todo lo que antecede yo creo que es conveniente ver esta película luego de haber visto ""Mon Oncle"" y ""Trafic"". Y armarse además de paciencia y saber que será un visionado que requiere descansos, rebobinados y algo de reflexión.

Lo moderno, la confusión y la ingenuidad. Eterno ""leitmotiv"" del señor Hulot la automatización de la vida moderna que le impide comprenderla, insertarse en ella e interactuar con el prójimo, aquí también se extiende al resto de los personajes. Todos ellos, desde los que esperan en el aeropuerto, los turistas que son acarreados para distintos hoteles o paseos de acuerdo a la letra de su apellido, hasta una increíble fauna de comensales y personal de servicio en la larguísima secuencia del restaurante de lujo que se inaugura sin haber terminado las obras de construcción del mismo, no encajan, no se acomodan, andan por el mundo como Monsieur Hulot —incluso hay tres o cuatro dobles de este personaje— tratando de encontrar su lugar en el mundo.

Los turistas que visitan Paris ven los íconos famosos de la ciudad luz solamente en los reflejos de las vidrieras (torre Eiffel, Arco de Triunfo). Además en su deambular por las calles y los comercios están rodeados de afiches turísticos que promocionan otros lugares (Grecia, Italia, España) pero todos ellos tienen la misma fotografía: un edificio todo metal y cristales que, a su vez, está presente una y otra vez en frente mismo a ellos.

Van todos como las ovejas en el rebaño y, por ejemplo, en una pista de baile con dimensiones para 6 o 7 parejas se ponen a bailar más de cincuenta personas. Una orquesta en vivo de jazz, interpretando un tema de ritmo africano, hace que el desenfreno de la danza de esa multitud debe verse repetidas veces no solo para volver a disfrutarla, sino también para descubrir infinidad de gags que son imperceptibles porque ocurren simultáneamente. Es prácticamente imposible imaginar cómo habrán sido los ensayos para mover a esa cantidad de extras con tanta precisión, con tanto garbo y con la desopilante consecuencia de esa enorme humorada.

De entre muchas, se destaca una escena en la que un anciano portero debe lidiar con un gigantesco panel electrónico para anunciar a una oficina la llegada de un cliente. Que las instrucciones estén escritas en un idioma desconocido para este pobre hombre es un detalle final que hace que la secuencia se antológica.

La secuencia final en un enorme carrusel (tiovivo) conformado por decenas de vehículos que dan vueltas alrededor de una especie de obelisco muestra algo así como una alegoría de que no todo está perdido: aparecen por primera vez los niños arrojando globos que dan un colorido final a una estupenda fotografía previa de tonos apagados, ocres y nocturnos.

Capitalismo, burgueses y trabajadores. El tono general es una sutil pero, a la vez, feroz crítica al progreso y al ""stablishment"". Por un lado la descripción de productos de consumo masivo ridículos e inútiles. Sillas y sillones que vuelven a su estado original cuando uno se pone de pie, escobas con faroles que permiten iluminar debajo de una mesa cuando se está barriendo, puertas insonoras diseñadas para dar portazos silenciosos, etcétera.

Los dueños de empresas, arquitectos, usuarios de gran poder económico que se visten todos iguales de punta en blanco para la ocasión, en la inauguración de un restaurante 5 tenedores que aún no terminó sus obras. Son quienes miran con desprecio al resto de los mortales, a los turistas de viajes económicos, a los borrachos callejeros y que tratan a sus empleados como perros.

Pero, como siempre, son los laburantes quienes tienen el peso de hacer funcionar las cosas. Son los meseros quienes sirven y sientan a los comensales en sus mesas, los cocineros y barmans quienes proveen las comidas y las bebidas, e incluso los porteros que abren y cierran puertas de vidrio que ya no existen porque fueron destruidas por Hulot. Estos trabajadores no van a restaurantes de lujo, van a pequeños lugares de comida rápida y prefieren los sándwiches de pan francés, vino suelto y alguna cerveza en lata.

En la debacle de la inauguración del restaurante queda bien claro que los grupos de turistas de paquetes económicos tienen horas distintas al resto para usar sus instalaciones, generalmente o muy temprano o tan tarde que ya uno no tiene ganas de comer. Cualquiera de nosotros que haya viajado en excursión sabe de todo esto.

La arquitectura y la geometría. Sobre este tema hay profuso material escrito en Internet. En varias facultades de arquitectura (Brasil, Francia, Bélgica) se estudian los decorados y las construcciones de Play Time. En la producción de esta película hubo una estrecha colaboración de arquitectos con Tati para la construcción del set.

Las líneas de fuga en los edificios, el diseño en un enorme complejo de oficinas dispuestas en cabinas que, aún cuando están contiguas, se comunican por teléfono para pasarse información que está archivada en la propia cabina desde la cual se piden los datos.

Pisos relucientes (y muy ruidosos al transitarlos), enormes ventanales que permiten el uso de luz natural pero que a la vez carecen de intimidad porque desde las veredas puede verse todo lo que ocurre puertas adentro. No sólo en los edificios comerciales, también en los rascacielos que alojan los apartamentos donde vive la gente y cuya vida interior transcurre como detrás de grandes vidrieras.

En fin, una joyita del séptimo arte sobre la cual se ha escrito mucho. Tal vez demasiado, incluyendo estas pobres líneas mías que bien podrían ser eliminadas.

Se trata de un filme que merece la pena hacer el esfuerzo intelectual y de atención para disfrutarla. Estoy tentado de decir para espectadores inteligentes pero no lo hago porque eso sería menospreciar al prójimo...

Cosa que nunca hizo Jacques Tati"
111,playtime,audience,5.0,p,"Thoroughly enjoyed it for an hour, adored it by the time the restaurant scene really got underway. Great satire, some amusing gags but above all utterly brilliant visuals. Definitely won't be everybody's cup of tea but this is a masterpiece for me, a true one of a kind and the level of effort that went into it must have been obscene."
112,playtime,audience,3.5,p,"In Jacques Tati's Playtime, Monsieur Hulot (Tati) wanders his way through an urban landscape bereft of vibrancy, color and personality, periodically crossing paths with an American tourist (Barbara Dennek) who seems intent on keeping distance between herself and her tour group.  There's not much plot and not much in the way of character development, but the visuals and the sound in Playtime, especially in the first half, are absolutely remarkable.  Every shot is perfectly framed and every scene is immaculately blocked.  The viewer, never sure where to look or what to focus on, almost becomes an active participant as characters appear and disappear out of frame.  Not all of the subtle comedy works and the restaurant scenes runs on for far too long but, despite this, there is only one Playtime and it is worth watching."
113,playtime,audience,3.5,p,so much detail in the preparation; the carousel scene is sublime
114,playtime,audience,2.5,n,"Oh Jacques Tati no plot has he, but he did have an enormous budget to construct a ginormous set. Tati does nothing for me. The films I've seen so far seem rather silly (Traffic very much so), arbitrary as hell as to meaning, and monotonous. Just because a lot is happening, and a great deal certainly does, it doesn't mean such action is particularly entertaining. To me, this is a great example of how you can look at any movie, esp. a foreign film as outre as this one, with an elaborate scale and so much detail, and make wild proclamations/assertions about its brilliance. Why is it seemingly every European film from this time was full of negative criticism of the 'modern world', the 'sterility of industrial times', and always harping on the bourgeoisie. Ohhh that darn bourgeoisie. Meh, too French, too Tati, too nebulous, and not too funny. 2.5 stars"
115,playtime,audience,5.0,p,"At the first time that I watched ""Playtime"" without knowing much about it but pretty familiar with his main star screenwriter and director Jacques Tati my only definition in order to try to explain my feelings and perceptions about this film that come to my mind then and now is… what wonderful kaleidoscope of gags visual scenes and funny sounds that will require multiple views to be fully appreciated.
Even knowing that Tati made previous Monsieur Hulot's movies in the past this movie also is a first in many ways for Hulot and his creator. Tati first color film also first time we do not necessarily see the old Paris that we expect to see but instead we have a more modern city leaning for the future and first time for Monsieur Hulot to come to at the big city with all the insanity that will come with it to that and finally is the first time that Hulot is not necessarily the main character but all citizens and the city itself as a whole.
If Modern Times by Chaplin critics to the industry and mechanization of human beings in order to get more comfortable life in the 30s Tati's movie really aims to modernity and technologies that may or may not will lead us to alienation late 60s and beyond. Is funny to look at Hulot trying to cope on how people are trying hard to understand new gadgets that supposed to make life easier. In one of the many memorable scenes and right after Monsieur Hulot first appearance on the movie a doorman has to announce his arrival by using a kind of modern call box that looks infinitely complex and gets funnier as the doorman start using it as Hulot just watch the poor man trying to make sure he touches the right keys.
For this masterpiece that would cost Tati not only his full force talent but also it would take 9 years to be made together with title of being France's the most expensive film ever made by 1967 and perhaps to this day still would be one of them and culminating with Jacques Tati's financial bankruptcy. It is hard to even imagine how Tati was able to finish such multilayered film like this where is so many things going on that if we blink our eyes we miss a small detail or another joke.
The magnificent director not only uses of visual content to make or create a joke he also uses revolutionary sound effects to do just the something similar or sometimes even more effective.
From the manager's very long walk on a hall that looks close but with the sound of his shoes approaching takes long time to reach the front lobby where Hulot waits to be interviewed or the sound from a small label tag in a briefcase on one of the important passenger that arrives on the airport scenes.
Everything is precisely timed and even the geometrical lines of the new landscape that confronts modern vs old architecture just showing reflexes of 2 main Paris attractions the Eiffel tower and the Basilica of Sacre-Couer by a small reflex and glimpse telling us that the old architecture no longer belong on a near future.
At end besides all the amazing intelligent humor after all it's one of the greatest classic French comedies with one main difference from their American counterparts that usually we watched with Coca-Cola and lots of popcorn. Tati's movie requires more views to be fully appreciated and for that we should watch eating caviar with a nice glass of wine… the finest French wine most likely. After all obstacles and difficulties and for our lucky Thank God he was able to finish the movie... and what a movie!"
116,playtime,audience,3.5,p,"""Playtime"" is a mid-20th century director's commentary on modern life.  The exploration opens to the austerity and conformity of the commercial world, and then leaves that all behind to focus on the chaotic opening of an up-scale restaurant - the passive main male character weaves throughout. The visuals are an amazing time capsule, and there is a lot to unpack in the director's choices, but this may be better appreciated by students of cinema rather than the top-box-office viewer..."
117,playtime,audience,3.0,p,"Playtime does have some strengths, but fails to live up to the hype.
I don't mind a plotless movie once in a while, but other aspects have to be exceptional to compensate. Which they are clearly not. 
What's most frustrating is that the movie keeps wearing down instead of building up. The slapstick which feels fresh and original in the beginning, feels trivial and trite by the end. 
In the second half the movie mostly deteriorates into a sequence of senseless, overcrowded, chaotic shots in a restaurant, which is hardly alleviated by the few memorable slapstick moments in-between.
Much of the humor is simply too naive. Some scenes - like the German guy grotesquely shouting and gesticulating for no apparent reason - almost made me cringe. Some of the better ones were extremely overused. When you see the logo of the restaurant imprinted on unsuspecting visitors' backs for the twentieth time, it feels silly instead of fun.
Coming back to the strengths - the use of the exaggerated sounds is unique in a good way and cinematography is quite strong and original. But that's about it."
118,playtime,audience,5.0,p,"There is so much at play here - commentaries on identity, consumerism, isolation, distortion, but above all, confusion in an increasingly complicated world. Whaty makes it so unique is the masterful composition, balancing all these elements without feeling bloated and preserving a universality that could almost preserve the film's impact without subtitles. Putting it all together with a slick collection of visuals including some discreet sight gags (love the melting airplane) in the way that only a former mime could, Tati's prowess is on full display. (5/5)"
119,playtime,audience,4.5,p,"This movie is intense! Only someone with an immaculate imagination and an unrelenting work-ethic could have made this movie. This is one of the most unique movies ever made, however, it doesn't make it easy to watch. I suggest watching it in multiple sittings because it just requires too much attention to watch it in a single sitting. Incredibly clever!"
120,1193743-step_brothers,critics,fresh,p,"One of those films that is impossible to rate highly, but impossible to not recommend."
121,1193743-step_brothers,critics,fresh,p,"Step Brothers obviously isn't the most complex screenplay ever written, but Ferrell, McKay and Reilly (who all co-wrote the film) manage to milk plenty of comedy out of essentially a one-joke movie."

123,1193743-step_brothers,critics,fresh,p,"The film doesn't aspire to much. It's happy to milk laughs from creative swearing, goofy, childish behavior, and a hilarious digression that explains exactly why you should never wake a sleepwalker. It does all of this well."
124,1193743-step_brothers,critics,fresh,p,It isn't even the funniest movie I've seen this year. But it sure made me laugh.

126,1193743-step_brothers,critics,rotten,n,"That ranks as a major disappointment, considering the two goofballs portraying the title Step Brothers -- Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly -- are usually good for at least a few laughs."

129,1193743-step_brothers,critics,fresh,p,"With their curly perms, slogan T-shirts (Life's a Beach, Spring Break '84 etc), nudie mags and Chewbacca masks, the stepbrothers make a nice comic pairing."
130,1193743-step_brothers,critics,fresh,p,"[The script] feels more like a series of dares than the blueprint for a movie. But damn if it doesn't work from beginning to end, thanks to the stars' near-psychotic commitment to their characters"
131,1193743-step_brothers,critics,fresh,p,The potentially gooey conclusion is leavened with cynical irreverence.
132,1193743-step_brothers,critics,fresh,p,"Though not as cleverly conceived or fully formed as Talladega Nights or Anchorman, this movie works because Ferrell and Reilly are completely believable as 13-year-olds stuck in 40-year-old bodies."

138,1193743-step_brothers,critics,fresh,p,"Step Brothers is unashamedly dumb, unoriginal and downright offensively childish. But aren't these the very same reasons why people like these movies?"
139,1193743-step_brothers,critics,fresh,p,The shouty variety of manchild comedy that Ferrell has cribbed from Jerry Lewis divides movie fans intensely. Here's the one we should put in the time capsule.
140,1193743-step_brothers,audience,0.5,n,"This movie made me realize for the first time, that none of these actors are funny."
141,1193743-step_brothers,audience,3.5,p,"Typical Ferrell, with some really great lines peppered throughout the standard script and alright movie. Funny enough. Better with beer and mates"
142,1193743-step_brothers,audience,0.5,n,"Instead of being assets to the film, Ferrel and Reilly make fools of themselves and add nothing to the experience. The constant bickering, whining and child play will quickly turn off even the most hardheaded and juvenile moviegoer."
143,1193743-step_brothers,audience,3.0,p,I know that some people absolutely love this one. I'm also not sure if I have ever actually seen this in its entirety before. It's pretty good but I'm not sure of it as a comedy classic in my view.
144,1193743-step_brothers,audience,3.5,p,"Far from perfect - plot gets messy... but it's still a hilarious movie that deserves a lot of credit. The chemistry between the characters is great, and it will leave you laughing. But it falls short being a truly special piece of cinema."

The line and scene writing in this movie is something I cannot explain. I'm not sure if any of the lines were improvised but they seemed too realistic. The poolside scene with Jim Stewart and Katherine Hepburn is probably my favorite movie scene of all time. The way they rabble on drunk and questioning whether they love or hate each other is so real that it can not go unseen. The supporting actors also deserve credit for creating a realistic upscale mansion dwelling crowd."

Although the film was great in a general sense and actors were spectacular, I believe that the resolution might have been reached in a better way.

Brilliant script (Oscar for David Ogden Stewart [no relation]), spotless direction by Oscar nominee George Cukor, and luminous acting from the stars: Oscar nominee Katharine Hepburn, Oscar winner Jimmy Stewart, Oscar nominee Ruth Hussey, and inexplicably un-nominated Cary Grant.

Kate said that the character of Tracy Samantha Lord was the closest to her in real-life of all the characters she ever played. Cary Grant appeared at her explicit demand (MGM was not Grant's studio).

Grace Kelly was better than Hepburn and that is the more important role in the movie. Jimmy Stewart was the best in this movie and I felt like Cary Grant didn't even want to make this movie.

A three-fer of classic Hollywood's grandest acting talents, the film stars Katharine Hepburn, ever the sparking freight train.

Monty Python and The Holy Grail was a blast to watch in all its low-budget absurd hilarity and I was in the mood for something similar so I decided to give their subsequent outing a shot and it turned out to be another hysterical watch of Biblical proportions. 
-
Monty Python's Life of Brian is about, well, the life of Brian. A fella born around the same night as Jesus where The Three Wise Men mistakenly enter his abode and thus start a whole series of events that will eventually make Brian the Messiah, much to his dismay. 
-
Set in Jerusalem under Roman rule, the movie pokes fun at whatever it can find in that setting in the usual Monty Python fashion and Religion is at the centre of it. Whether it's religious fanatics, mob mentality, self-proclaimed prophets, living under foreign rule, rebellious groups, politics, etc it's all thrown into a pot with a layer of cleverness, a dab of absurdness, and a thick dose of exaggerated comedic chops, resulting in a non-stop hilarious romp that will have you in stitches. 
-
One of my favourite scenes was the entire Biggus Dickus bit. You just turn into one of the soldiers who just can't hold it in. And of course, the wonderful closing of the film via the song ""Always look on the bright side of life"" being sung by the Crucifixion party... how can one not love it. Wonderful performances by the entire cast. 
-
If you can have an open mind and are not someone who gets easily offended, especially if you're the religious type, and have not watched this movie yet, I'd highly recommend it. It will certainly lighten up your day/night and your life a tad bit henceforth. Hard for me to say whether I enjoy this one more or The Holy Grail without having rewatched either of them so for now, they are equal in my eyes. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a solid 8/10."
201,monty_pythons_life_of_brian,audience,5.0,p,"Just as uproariously funny as Holy Grail, if not funnier, Life of Brian offers an equal helping of memorable skits, immensely quotable dialogue, great comedic timing from everybody involved and even a catchy little ending musical number, helping to further cement Monty Python as bringing out the best, when it comes to British humour. Yes indeed, this religious comedy is very much NOT overrated. REJOICE!"

204,monty_pythons_life_of_brian,audience,3.0,p,"Monty Python's Life of Brian is irreverently funny. This film dances awfully close to the border of blasphemy, yet it never quite crosses that line. Some of the jokes go on a little too long, and some of the humor is in bad taste, but I laughed more than I thought I would. Even though Monty Python and the Holy Grail is still my favorite, I was pleasantly surprised by Life of Brian."
205,monty_pythons_life_of_brian,audience,1.5,n,"Except for the funny stoning scene toward the beginning, and the song at the end, everything else in the movie misfires. Yes, the idea is that another man (Brian) is mistaken for the Messiah-but the story's big flaw is that the real Messiah is already present, briefly shown giving a sermon to a crowd. On top of that, there is nothing about Brian that would convince anyone he was the Messiah; he doesn't even pretend to be one. This gives the whole movie a contrived atmosphere.

The other scenes are hardly funny either. The Jews who plot against the Romans ask what the Roman occupiers have done for them, and as the scene goes on, the speaker amasses a list of benefits brought by the Romans. In a way, this glorifies colonialism and fails to explain why natives invariably come to despise their occupiers. There were plenty of reasons for the Jews to hate the Romans, but that is hardly brought up. Also, other jokes such as ""Biggus Dickus"" and Pontius Pilate not being able to say the letter ""R"" are juvenile without being funny.

""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" was much better because it was clever; this movie perhaps tried to be meaningful and simply blew it."
206,monty_pythons_life_of_brian,audience,1.5,n,"A huge disappointment. The concept seemed ripe for irreverent and witty commentary on religion, but instead we get tired jokes about speech impediments."
207,monty_pythons_life_of_brian,audience,5.0,p,"I'd always get irritated watching Python with Dad growing up because there are a lot of Biblical references I didn't get because he gave up on being a Christian when they found the drunk priest dead in the snow at his Catholic College. He went from Spiritual major to Physics, which is great, but it doesn't train your daughter to get religious jokes, nor do well in her lit classes, because every other stoner around her is like (points at book) ""This is SOOOO Jesus..."" and she only know what some clowns did to Jesus, so it doesn't click with her like that.

This one is important because you can contextualize it now in a time where John Cleese has been on social media and is practicing both getting pummeled by stones and throwing them while being in a glass house. In the scene ""Stoned to Death"" where an old man is held for saying Jehovah, it might as well be Cleese on social media speaking to the old man of himself in time, berating the hostage, berating the audience, and eventually taking a good beating himself. It's a great Meme for everyone to frolic in, as it holds up as not only an accurate metaphor of these spiritual times, but of the actor who played in their creation.

As with any Monty Python, I'm sure we have some brownface in this one, so if you are opposed to all that, don't watch. To bring in other spiritual myths to this Messianic comedy, there is a story about Krishna (the black God) complaining his consort Radha* is too light skinned, so he playfully paints her skin black. There are lots of bad spiritual myths we can give weight to in any literary form, but, I feel like that's a pretty great story to keep the play of theatre alive without celebrating racist constructs. Hindu myths are wonderful for freeing many restrictive notions, and if you ever want an excuse for your behavior, there's a million myths breaking that psychology down for you with avatars of deity.

20,city_lights,audience,5.0,p,"For adults who want to show children a purer form of comedy, City Lights is your movie.  This sweet but comic slapstick classic shows Chaplin deceiving a blind flower girl to gain her love.  It is a fun movie and a valuable one.  If you've never seen a silent film, this is the one to see.  It teaches the lessons that appearances can be deceptive and a man with nothing to his name can be as honorable as any millionaire.

As an actor, Chaplin is a marvel, conveying astonishing emotional depth through the silent antics of his little tramp.  As a director, he demonstrates an impeccable sense of timing with difficult, gracefully choreographed stunts.  The entire family may bust a collective gut watching him skitter across a slippery dance floor, or outmaneuver an imposing boxing opponent, but then be rendered speechless by the poignant ending.  To blink while watching is to miss something.  Like Modern Times, another masterpiece, this film touches on some sensitive issues but doesn't become weighed down by them.  A morose drunk man makes repeated suicide attempts, although the audience never feels the danger.  

This was a thumb in the eye to talkies by Chaplin and is perhaps his best film ever."

22,city_lights,audience,3.5,p,"The importance of Charlie Chaplin films cannot be overstated, and City Lights always pops up whenever you discuss his best. A classic blend of slapstick and pathos, the kind that The Tramp character was always associated with, I did laugh a number of times, but I also spent significant periods waiting for something significant to happen. It's obvious how talented Chaplin was, and he dedicated himself fully to his craft, and while the material he comes up with is usually amusing, he seems to have trouble filling out an entire film. Some scenes, including the prelude to the boxing match, and the match itself, go on for much longer than they should, and just start repeating the same jokes to diminishing effect. It's a fun story, and The Tramp's hapless antics are always bolstered by the fact that he is, in essence, always trying to do good, never hurts anyone out of malice, and ultimately is just trying to get by in a difficult world. Maybe Chaplin's style of comedy isn't to my taste, but I certainly appreciate how much he did for the world of Cinema at large, and there's certainly a lot of elements to recommend. Not to everyone's taste, but it's still a landmark film that any movie buff should see at least once."

26,city_lights,audience,5.0,p,"A deliriously fun slapstick from the silent film era!

Charlie Chaplin's romantic comedy-drama City Lights (1931) has a lot of heart for such an early picture. Chaplin's direction is relentlessly fast paced with constant jokes and visual gags flying at you. Even in black and white, without any voices, you can still laugh along with this delightful comedy classic. City Lights will surely entertain anyone of any age as great slapstick can get laughter out of any viewer. Seeing Charlie Chaplin don his Tramp outfit and character is such a blast. You like this silly man and root for his romantic quest to end up nicely. Virginia Cherrill is enchanting as A Blind Girl with her forlorn looks and eyes displaying longing for someone who loves her. She's natural and moving in an iconic role.

Chaplin has interesting ideas as he simultaneously critiques the ultra rich with their selfish ways, empathizes with the poor Tramp on the street, as well as sympathizing with A Blind Girl's struggle to pay the rent by selling a few flowers. Charlie Chaplin, Harry Crocker, and Harry Clive's writing beautifully blends effortless slapstick comedy, biting satire against the wealthy, and sweet romance with two out of luck people.

Charlie Chaplin and Willard Nico's editing is super quickly cut, with sharp edits for instant jokes from all the nonsense herein. City Lights is a brisk 87 minutes, especially with Chaplin and Nico's sped up footage. Gordon Pollock and Roland Totheroh's cinematography is very playful with perspectives and wide shots that let you think it's all real. They hide most of the wires and setups in the room for all the slapstick gags with Chaplin running around everywhere. Charles D. Hall's set decoration is realistic and also helps hide visual gags before they happen. 

Charlie Chaplin and Arthur Johnston's score is lovely. They compose music that suits the ridiculous slapstick as well as the heavy romance drama scenes with the girl. Your heart swells with the Tramp due to their rising melodies and thunderous compositions. City Lights' score sounds as modern and dreamy as any refined movie music.

In all, City Lights is still worth seeking out. I highly recommend The Criterion Collection's restoration on blu-ray as it has never looked better."
27,city_lights,audience,4.0,p,"I preferred the Gold Rush, but particularly the latter half of this film (from about the boxing scene on) hits that magic point of comedy and pathos that Chaplin did so well."

Kid viewers can relate to his immaturity, toys, and wistful need to make everyone laugh.  

Arthur is one of the. most enabled alcoholics ever, booze seems to be his fuel.  He has an entourage of attractive non gold digging females vying to pamper him.

52,1001240-arthur,audience,0.5,n,"I missed the beginning of the movie, but what I saw of it was quite enough. The supporting cast, especially Shakespearean actor John Gielgud as Arthur's sarcastic butler, did a good job, but the main characters unfortunately brought the movie down.

Arthur, the star, is a rich happy drunk with no ambition, and his family arranges him to marry a rich woman whom he does not love, but he must go through with it or lose his chance of inheriting the family fortune. Along the way he meets a waitress/struggling actress whom he does fall in love with. What to do? The movie's major problem is that we're supposed to find a man with a drinking problem humorous. Trouble is, drunkards are not happy people-see ""Leaving Las Vegas"" to show how having a drinking problem is really like. Not fun at all. Arthur's butler shows real concern for him, and Arthur redeems himself by his showing concern for him as he dies-but the redemption is temporary. In the end he shows up drunk at his wedding and publicly humiliates his bride. Ha, ha. Of course he will get his fortune anyway in the end.

The other problem is Liza Minelli as the girlfriend. Her career only existed because her father, director Vincent Minelli, pushed her into her acting career, as she looks ugly and is a weak actress. Seeing her is as appealing as eating an average worm sandwich. (Though admittedly the movie would have been a turkey no matter who played the girlfriend.)"

54,1001240-arthur,audience,4.5,p,"Arthur is probably one of the finest romantic comedies I have seen in a very long time, an especially charming one whose cast and crew really make it different than any other of its kind and elevate its cliched plot. Arthur Bach (a spectacular Dudley Moore) is constantly drunk millionaire playboy who ""races cars, plays tennis, fondles women, takes the weekends off and is his own boss"". He leads an affluent life with his sharp witted and sarcastic friend, father figure and butler Hobson (John Gielgud, in his very best role, worthy of the Oscar he received, he stole the show). He is to marry the snub, mundane daughter of a businessman, and if he doesn't, he'll lose an inheritance of over half a billion dollars. It is when he meets a poor, aspiring actress from Queens (Liza Minnelli, truly wonderful and explosive) that he realizes that true love is priceless and that he must grow up to face the consequences of his dreams and hopes. The only film by Steve Gordon, the film boasts a top tier cast, including the hilarious supporting roles, one of the finest soundtracks I have heard in a movie (by veteran Burt Bacharach, who shared an Oscar for Best Song with three other people, that song is still stuck in my head) and incredible scenery and art direction (the wonderful, charming New York and the Bach Mansion...). The make up and costumes are wonderful as well. The true star of the movie is the carefully written screenplay and direction. Gordon has the ability to balance intelligent humor, some serious themes, fascinating dialogue that keeps you interested and beautiful shots in a hilarious movie about growing up, the power of love and money, loss and death and the simple things in life, tied together with the signature Arthur's laugh and jokes. I love this movie just for the dialogue, the jokes (much like Being There, the film is not so much of a comedy, though the humor is present and smart) and the aesthetic that elevate the usually boring premise into somehing truly unique. My only problems are the fact that the ""drunk"" joke is taken just a tad too far, and the fact that the cinematography and editing make the film feel like a made for television film or a theatrical play for the screen, consequently feeling that some scened drag a litle bit. Overall, I can't recommend this movie enough for essentially everything. ""Maybe I should come in and wash your d*ck for you, you little sh*t."""
55,1001240-arthur,audience,3.0,p,"Supposedly about how an irresponsible yet uber-rich man-boy (Dudley Moore) finds real love, this is really about said multimillionaire's father-son relationship with his caring manservant (John Gielgud, who steals the film effortlessly). Oh, there is a love story supplied, but there is little to it, chemistry-wise or story-wise. Our hero is barely-able-to-walk drunk when he decides to ""grow up"" and run off with the miscast Liza Minnelli, and one feels as if he will run off yet again once he returns to his senses, away from her. This was a popular film in it's time, but since then has lost its appeal, propped up by the singular gag of a stream of Borscht Belt style patter incongruously delivered by a short English drunk."

58,1001240-arthur,audience,3.5,p,"The first and only film to be both written and directed by Steve Gordon, who tragically passed away at the age of 44 a year after the release of this movie, ""Arthur"" is one of the very few comedies I've seen that I can say I thoroughly enjoyed, yet sparsely laughed during. Granted, I did smile or at least make a mental note of when I thought the movie was being relatively clever in its comedic stylings. Still, though, I'm shocked at how hand-in-hand the comedy remains with the other elements of the movie, namely the character work and overall spirit of the film. The relationship between Dudley Moore's titular protagonist and Sir John Gielgud's Academy Award winning turn as the wise-cracking butler, ""Hobson,"" was more than just hilarious. You get honest-to-God emotion from the more serious aspects of their bond. And, I have to say, for being a comedy of the more romantic persuasion, it's been a minute since I've seen one where I honestly enjoyed seeing the two leads perform together in the same scene. Sweet and impressive."
59,1001240-arthur,audience,3.0,p,"The film dangerously teeters into trifle territory with an obsession of booze humour, a mentality of money is everything, and a predictable odd meets reasonable love story coupled with a disappointing Liza Minelli performance. 
Thankfully, ""Arthur"" manages to reach safe ground by its end as it recognizes the dark side of rich class, shows empathy for its titular character (a difficult performance to make likeable by Dudley Moore), and has touches of wit to string along with (the best lines are delivered by John Gielgud). 
These qualities are only enough to provide an average film though."

The contract scene and, what I will call, the clown car as the cabin scene were likely what will be most memorable for me.

87,1015002-night_at_the_opera,audience,3.0,p,"When A Night at the Opera is funny, it's pretty funny. The problem is that there are extended musical interludes that—while showcasing the talent of the actors—bring the movie to a complete halt. The Marx Brothers' style of comedy may not resonate as much with modern audiences, but if you're a fan of vaudevillian performances and slapstick comedy, I think you'll enjoy A Night at the Opera."
88,1015002-night_at_the_opera,audience,4.0,p,"As time goes on, I'm more and more convinced that physical comedy ages much better than dialogue-based humor; the universal nature of the jokes, their simplicity, and lack of a need of context makes them more of a long-term favorite. As a result, Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, and Sellers will probably enjoy greater lasting international popularity and acclaim than the two Marx brothers not named Harpo. Groucho Marx has a very distinct brand of comedy that you either like or you don't - fast-talking and oftentimes a bit sloppy on delivery, hoping that quantity will carry the day (and it often does), while Chico is really just the less-endearing counterpart for his brother to play off of. Harpo is consistently solid, offerring a more buffoonish counterpart to his verbose brothers, but he's not a strong comparison to the great solo physical comedians that made a name for themselves in the the decades prior to the rise of the Marx trio. Still, there is something about the dedication to increasingly exasperating, long-running scenes that makes the fraternal act distinctive and endearing, and one of the best representatives of their style is the climactic chaos of A Night at the Opera, in which the three engage in silliness and smooth-talking until an appropriately upbeat conclusion is reached. The actual romantic plot that in theory drives the film is so secondary and tacked on, when it reemerges after long breaks you may often find yourself struggling to remember that it was ever there in the first place. Alongside Duck Soup, probably the longest-lived and most critically acclaimed Marx Brothers film. (4/5)"

110,lady_eve,audience,4.0,p,"God how disgusting that must feel that everyone on the cruise ship is interested in you because of your wealth. Damn Stanwyck's so playful and flirty, I love it. She has this air of confidence and charm about her that I find very attractive. The type of woman that can take care of herself. Fonda plays the modest and somewhat shy and clumsy naive rich man which suits him perfectly. The chemistry between the two is attractive to watch. This movie feels kinda cozy. It taking place on a ship and all. The dialogue is very witty, it's quick and sharp. 

I get the whole charm and humor to this movie but unfortunately I can't relate to it at all. This was made during a different time when things were spoiled and Hollywood was all about glamour. I'm not rich, I do not care about high class society (unless it's being parodied), and I can't relate to con artists. That's the problem with me and a lot of these movies from the 40's and 50's - they're kind of cheesy and lame, especially with some of the sayings that were used back then. I didn't really like the way the characters developed. There's not really any sense to it. Like I don't understand how Charles didn't realize that Jean was cosplaying as Lady Eve. To the point where he falls in love and marries her. It makes him look really dumb and naive. And Jean's ways are really crooked and petty. Like the way she gets revenge by tricking Charles into thinking she's another woman and actually gets him to marry her. This movie really made men look like Neanderthal dumbasses and women as the one's who can get away with anything without any serious repercussions. Can you blame the guy for being pissed off when he finds out that Jean is a con artist and then decides to forget about her? 

Like the whole premise of the movie is pretty weird and twisted! They're basically glamorizing petty behavior and for women to go out and be charming little gold digging con artists. I liked the actors and the acting, but the themes and morals left a bad taste in my mouth. It just left me kind of confused as to what I just saw."
111,lady_eve,audience,5.0,p,"Smart wit with a romantic romp.

Preston Sturges' romantic comedy The Lady Eve (1941) appears at first to be a classy crime thriller movie, then devolves into a study of what people want in their ideal spouse. Sturges' writing is so clever with intellight and snappy dialogue. Every line can mean more than one thing as one card shark lady wants to manipulate a millionaire into marrying her. Sturges' direction is fun and light-hearted, so you never feel bad if someone gets ripped off. The Lady Eve is about the lack of morality involved in manipulative crimes as well as the ethics of rich people able to blow money over a card game. It's fast and funny with a sweetly silly romance narrative on top.

Barbara Stanwyck steals every second of The Lady Eve as master seductress Jean Harrington. She's effortless whether flirting or fleecing Henry Fonda. Fonda is funny as the dumbest man who ever lived named Charles Pike. His clueless act is a real treat as he's so gullible and easy for Stanwyck to manipulate. Stanwyck is so hilarious and looks divine. Her easy charm and stunning charisma make The Lady Eve a genuine delight to watch. I loved Preston Sturges' Sullivan's Travels because of Veronica Lake and I adored The Lady Eve because of Barbara Stanwyck.

Charles Coburn is very sly and funny as Colonel Harrington. His sleight of hand card tricks are really cool to watch. Eugene Pallette is a riot with his deep booming voice and annoyance at Fonda's antics. William Demarest is great as Muggsy with his endless suspicions of Stanwyck.

The Lady Eve progresses naturally and quickly with Stuart Gilmore's editing cutting quickly from encounter to encounter to 97 minutes. Victor Milner's cinematography lets you see all the cards on the table with mostly wide shots and playful framing during the medium shots with Eve leaning into the man for affection. Edith Head's costumes are to die for as she crafts a dozen gorgeous gowns for Barbara Stanwyck that look timeless. There's a lot of style and fashion here. Wally Westmore and Bill Nye's make-up makes Stanwyck look dreamy in every scene.

In short, I laughed the entire way through The Lady Eve. It has really held up thanks to Barbara Stanwyck's delirious devious performance."
112,lady_eve,audience,3.5,p,"A slightly nonsensical screwball comedy where Barbara Stranwyck absolutely steals the show. She's very sassy and vivacious in her role(s) with the rest of the cast kind of limply hanging off her. Some rubbish slapstick and some soppy romance aside, the daft plot still just about works."
113,lady_eve,audience,4.0,p,"Good in a weird and distinctive way, if a bit aggravating at times. The relationship between Stanwyck's Jean and Fonda's Charles is bizarre. He's a naive and often oblivious timid aristocrat and she's a clever con artist; he falls for her experienced seduction and she for his simple charm. It initially makes the film seem off-balance given how in-control Jean is, though in time it's treated as a deliberate satire of the traditional power dynamic in rom-coms of the period, often featuring dominant men and unsure women. Overtly, it's a humorous depiction of the Biblical Eve narrative, where Stanwyck's fling with the pure Fonda results in his obtaining of ""forbidden knowledge"" and subsequent fall from grace as he literally stumbles through the rest of the film. Jean's initial greed mellows into affection, then vengeful distaste at being rebuffed, and ultimately into affection once more, but Stanwyck handles this conflicted-yet-intelligent antihero character perfectly. Sturges, in his dual role as writer-director, left room for some real comedy in the film as well, balancing between physical humor and gems like Charles' refusal to recognize Jean because the resemblance was TOO obvious (she would have changed something, right). There was clearly a ton of thought that went into the design of this film, and while I can't say that it's an unparalleled success at face value (often feeling frustrating, even if that was Sturges' intention; treating Fonda as a fool in his inability to recognize the ""same dame"" in the final minutes almost makes their relationship seem uncomfortably predatory), The Lady Eve remains an icon of the genre. (4/5)"
114,lady_eve,audience,5.0,p,"Understandably a critics favourite, a comedy worth it's while, avoids stereotypes and humanises the 'femme fatale figure' as more than, well, a con artist and seducer of man. Despite many audience reviews, Jean is visibly upset, heartbroken, yet mans demise is in his hypocrisy, Henry Fonda's character of 'Charles' claims to be a forgiving man after the marriage to Eve but this is only said when his previous image of her is still majorly intact, very much reminiscent of the ending to Henrik Ibsen's play 'A Dolls House' - however this is a students perspective, there's no need to debate too long the morality of these characters due to it's genre. As a slapstick comedy it not only delivers in physical comedy but the literate within speech. Worth the watch, fun and easily digestible whilst maintaining certain mystery."

117,lady_eve,audience,0.5,n,"This movie was low key terrible. The first half wasn't that bad, actually pretty entertaining, but then the plot went ridiculous. After Fonda's character finds out the girl was initially manipulating him, he rationally leaves her, himself broken hearted. Then Stanwyck's character proceeds to seek revenge on him, as if he was in the wrong, and continues to lie and manipulate him again, just to humiliate him even more. Which is the very thing that made him leave her in the first place. Then the movie proceeds to make Fonda's character unrealistically gullible, not even able to recognize her, as she continues to embarrass him. You can't help but just feel horribly sorry for the man, based on how really innocent and good of a man he is in the movie. Yet the girl never learns anything. And to top it off the ending makes him go straight back to her. The woman who broke his heart. When the movie ends you only feel sorry for the man, and wonder why he doesn't leave her broken hearted once more when he finds out how she had manipulated him once again. And yet the girl never learns anything but gets what she wants from her lies and manipulation and by playing with a man's heart. Terrible. Too bad, since it started out so well too."

Barbara Stanwyck has never been better.  She commands all her scenes and makes the audience fall in love with her, just like her tricked beau.  Fonda is also at his best.

His idea to run the citizens out is to hire a new sheriff, who happens to be black.  Some truly funny moments in this flick, but some of the jokes (on racism and homosexuality) would never play today.  The ending breaks the fourth wall.  Good cast for the most part, including Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, and Harvey Korman.

175,league_of_their_own,audience,4.0,p,"This was another film in my kids' pandemic Film Appreciation Course and they gave this one a thumbs up. You all know the story, loosely based on real female athletes who formed a women's baseball league after the majors shut down at the outset of World War II. The film tackles sexism, corporate greed, and also an appreciation for America's pastime, baseball. It does all this in a rather maudlin and at times corny fashion, but it's a pretty irresistible story and with a pretty stellar cast, which includes Geena Davis, Lori Petty, Madonna, Rosie O'Donnell, Anne Ramsay, Janet Jones, Téa Leoni, Harry Shearer, David Strathairn, Garry Marshall, Jon Lovitz, Bill Pullman, Eddie Jone, Don S. Davis, Del Close, and Tom Hanks, who steals the show as the team manager, a washed up ball player who's simply paid to wave to the crowd at the start of each game. With that cast and being directed by Penny Marshall (""Big"" ""Awakenings"") and written by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (""City Slickers"" ""Splash"" ""Parenthood""), it's hard to see how this film wouldn't work. Although cloying at times, ""A League of Their Own"" is a must see comedy/drama."

201,barbershop,audience,1.0,n,"It was so well-acclaimed by critics, and it was supposed to be an accurate description of black culture and how life was like in an inner-city barbershop, and I was excited to finally find it and see it.

Basically, the whole thing was confusing and chaotic. We see two burglars smash into a store and pull out its safe with a truck, then somebody trying to make a hit record to get rich after other such schemes had failed (shades of The Honeymooners), the barbershop opening, a man cheating on his girl, all in rapid-fire succession so that we have trouble figuring out who is who and what exactly is going on. After 20 minutes, my mother and I bailed; the whole thing was so slapdash and confusing we gave up trying to follow it.

It could have been a contender, but it was so rushed and clumsy it turned out to be a complete misfire."

Before one watches Barbershop, one will already be familiar with the plot. There's a Barbershop owner who finds himself in a dilemma and eventually has to do what he can to save the day.

The film, like the Barbershop itself, is a comfortable place to hang out to kill some time. Something that the whole family can enjoy. Comedy in Barbershop has aged somewhat well.

The mood can be a bit all over the place as it moves from quick burns of each character to the slapstick comedy that Anthony Anderson delivers. Yet, Tim Story is able to combine each element of the story in an enjoyable bundle.

3/5. Light, refreshing watch for those looking to kill some time."

Yes, the movie is old, silly escapist entertainment for a worried wartime audience, but still works today thanks to broad if crazy humor and great performances by the leads, who also take jibes at their employers and government censors without overdoing it. Classic songs also make the experience enjoyable."

15,road_to_morocco,audience,2.0,n,Road to Morocco (1942) Staring Bing Crosby & Bob Hope The strangest part was the camels with the animated talking bottom lips and animated eyes towards the end of this film. I personally did not find this film funny at all. The comedy was slap stick like and it did not make me laugh. What got me was how much of this film looked like it was either blue screen or there was a projected background for scenes rather than use a real environment that looked more like the desert or a location. I thought it was dumb that each time they got ship wrecked it was for smoking in a powder room. It was like come on. After they got Shipwrecked for smoking onboard a ship.
16,road_to_morocco,audience,3.0,p,"Reading the 2nd volume of the bio of Bing Crosby, I realized I have never watched a ""Road"" movie with Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour. The movie is topical (1942!) and just plain silly fun"

Racist, sexist, homophobic, and so on-of course, the movie reflects its time in those ways, but that doesn't make it entertaining to watch Hope do a poor mockery of a mentally challenged person. While we should have the capacity to historicize without judgment, that doesn't mean the viewer should have to excuse without reflection, and simply put, that stuff today lands with a foul thud."
19,road_to_morocco,audience,4.5,p,"It's unfortunate that many people who might be familiar with this film only know it through the homage done on Family Guy. The unfortunate part of this is that most wouldn't recognize the origin of the bit and go watch the reference material, which is much funnier than Family Guy could make it. Buddy films have been around for a long time, so it's nice to see how one of the founding films of this comedy sub-genre succeeded at it.

The success of a Buddy film comes from the talent of its two main characters. In this case, Orville ""Turkey"" Jackson (Bob Hope) is the lovably dim partner to Jeff Peters (Bing Crosby), the snarky singer and brains of the operation. Those who might be looking for a pure slapstick comedy are bound to be slightly disappointed, because the gold of this film is in its repartee. Verbal jabs, wordplay, and double entendre abound in this film, but pay attention because they come fast and frequent. For its time, it was also quite raunchy, albeit not nearly as much as some of the ""gross-out"" comedies of today are. In fact, its special effects were quite ahead of its time as well (some of them quite fun to watch, especially the ""voice swap"" version of Moonlight Becomes You).

Having already seen Bing Crosby in a number of great films, including Holiday Inn (1942) and Going My Way (1944), the latter of which won Best Picture and garnered Crosby a Best Actor Oscar, I already knew his propensity for great dramatic acting. In Road to Morocco, I was pleasantly surprised to see his comedy is on-point as well. Of course, that being said, the man in his comedy element was definitely Bob Hope. His facial expressions and reactions were fantastically hilarious and most scenes he appeared in were filled with him chewing the scenery. I may have to watch more of his films (including the others in the ""Road to . . ."" series), because this one was certainly great.

Occasionally ""self aware"", but filled with plenty of verbal and situational comedy, I give Road to Morocco 4.5 stars out of 5."

It seems unrealistic to think that Grant's affably clumsy genteel self would be so enamoured with her - and it's this relationship that permeates through the weddings and the funeral.

Hugh Grant is the best thing about 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', he gives an amusing performance. The plot is obvious and speaks for itself, it does lead to a few interesting shenanigans. Some of the dialogue is iffy, as is some of the editing though.

None of the cast behind Grant stood out to me, with the exception of Rowan Atkinson; but that's only down to how well known he is in general, as here he is underused. I found Andie MacDowell's performance very wooden. I appreciate them not going the obvious route with Kristin Scott Thomas' character, even if it makes her Fiona redundant throughout.

Just about serviceable, worth watching if only once."
50,four_weddings_and_a_funeral,audience,4.5,p,"There's a simple reason why Four Weddings remains a high-watermark in British film: every contributor is working at the top of their game. Hugh Grant - now recognised as the great actor he has always been - leads an ensemble of equally fine character actors, all of whom find nuance, pathos and comedy in the tiniest of roles. Richard Curtis' script is funny and sad and beautifully structured. But perhaps the hero is director Mike Newell, who brings it all together with great skill. A great comedy."

81,what_we_do_in_the_shadows,audience,5.0,p,"Absolutely hilarious vampire spoof from New Zealand's finest!

Writers and directors Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement's horror comedy mockumentary What We Do in the Shadows (2014) is a delightfully light hearted spoof of all things vampiric. They parody and play around with Bram Stoker's iconic monster the vampire from blood draining to not appearing in mirrors with charming New Zealand accents and dry humor. Waititi and Clement's writing feels refreshingly clever and silly, so What We Do in the Shadows always remains playfully lighthearted in spirit Waititi's Jojo Rabbit or Clement's Flight of the Conchords.

Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement's direction is simply magnificent to behold. What We Do in the Shadows is filmed like a documentary, but for making fun of these pretend subjects, much like Rob Reiner's influential mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap. Cinematographers Richard Bluck and DJ Stipsen's hand held camera work keeps the camera moving in wide angle shots like you're really there, while diverting to interview segments like a documentary. It really is like several interviews with various vampires for a black comedy laugh. The entire feel of the film is like going out for a lark with your friends like Shaun of the Dead or The World's End with a bit of edgier moments like Trainspotting.

It's super funny to see these archetypes of vampires get parodied like Max Schreck's creature like Nosferatu, Bela Lugosi's gentleman Dracula, Christopher Lee's bloodthirsty Horror of Dracula, Frank Langella's romantic Dracula, Klaus Kinski's Nosferatu the Vampyre, Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt's vampires from The Interview with the Vampire, Gary Oldman's monstrous Count Dracula and his romantic Dracula, Richard Roxburgh's rockstar Dracula, Robert Pattinson's Twilight vampire Edward, Alicia Silverstone and Krysten Ritter's Vamps, to Luke Evans' handsome sympathetic Dracula. I'm sure there are other vampires referenced too if you look hard enough. 

As a fan of vampire horror films and vampire lore, What We Do in the Shadows spoofs the classics, while adding a contemporary locale of charming Wellington, New Zealand in the backdrop. Ra Vincent's production design is fun for the modern flat in New Zealand reimagined as a group of vampire mates living together in bloody filth.

Taika Waititi's friendly vampire Viago is very cute and funny. He's like Frank Langella's romantic Dracula mixed with Bela Lugosi's charming gentleman Vampire, but with more frills. Waititi hilariously said that he based Viago off of his mother. Jemaine Clement's vampire Vladislav is cool as a Vlad the Impaler type, clearly making fun of and homaging Gary Oldman's Dracula. Jonny Brugh's try hard vampire Deacon is a blast with his psychic suggestion and bat transformations. Ben Fransham's vampire Petyr is an awesome parody of Max Schreck's Nosferatu and Klaus Kinski's Nosferatu the Vampyre. His hideous appearance, shadowy nature, creeping around, and vicious bloodlust are wonderful tributes to the first film incarnation of a vampire. I appreciate how closely they matched Max Schreck's make-up and costume from Nosferatu for Petyr.

Cori Gonzalez-Macuer's hipster vampire victim Nick is a funny parody of Twilight's modern vampires I'd say. Stuart Rutherford is fun as their IT pal Stu. Jackie van Beek is lovely and sympathetic as Deacon's human familiar Jackie. Her righteous indignation over not getting turned into a vampiress is a riot to watch. Elena Stejko is pretty and cool as vampiress Pauline The Beast. Rhys Darby's supporting role as the alpha male werewolf Anton is so funny. It's nice to see Jemaine Clement cast Darby as he was hilarious in Flight of the Conchords' show. Ian Harcourt's polite zombie is a quaint cameo during The Unholy Masquerade sequence. Lastly, Child actresses Morgana Hills and Morag Hills are seriously adorable as the young vampiresses seeking out pedophiles to kill and drain their blood around the Wellington area of New Zealand.

Furthermore, Plan 9's music is quite funny itself with plenty of old timey folk music stuffed in here for a chuckle. Editors Jonathan Woodford-Robinson, Yana Gorskaya, and Tom Eagles splice together historical footage and pictures with recreated scenes for a funny mockumentary feel. The joke pacing and conversations cut quickly to keep the laughs coming for a breezy 86 minutes of vampire frolicking and feasting.

In short, I simply adored What We Do in the Shadows. It's honestly up there with Taika Waititi's greatest films like Jojo Rabbit or Hunt for the Wilderpeople."
82,what_we_do_in_the_shadows,audience,4.0,p,Great addition to the mockumentary genre. Waititi and Clement make hilarity look effortless. I laughed out loud several times.

And even though the parodies are a little dated now, I still think the sketches are clever, the story is amusing, and the performances are a lot of fun to watch. It's quotable, it's enjoyable, and it makes me wish Spatula City was a real store."

105,uhf,audience,0.5,n,"I watched it once when I was younger and I remember I kinda liked it but remembered nothing specific about it, because it's pretty forgettable.

106,uhf,audience,3.0,p,"Weird Al Yankovic is George Newman, who routinely gets fired from every job he gets.

Anyways, I digress, great movie, seen it a million times, I can quote every line. It stars freaking WEIRD AL YANKOVICH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!!! So yeah, you should watch it."
111,uhf,audience,4.0,p,"So, this is a movie made by Weird Al, the king of parodies. And of course, that's what the movie is gonna have a TON of, it's full of funny parodies that could make a bad day have some light in it. It's a fun movie, it has a BUNCH of funny jokes, where some even get across today. I got into Weird Al about a year and a half ago, but I remember watching this as a kid. And now I can appreciate it a LOT more.
The characters and story are nothing to be AMAZED by, you have:
The overly evil villain(which is overly evil because that's what makes him fun), not a SCARY villain but a villain at that, when it seems like he's about to win you're routing for the good guys, when he falls it's satisfying, and hearing him yell at that guy so horribly, only to hear that he was yelling at his SON, was funny even today. The geeky hero which represents the little guy, who has it hard in life, but is a dreamer, and when he gets the chance to chase his dream it SURPRISINGLY goes well! He's a failure but never gives up, I can personally relate to that one XD
The best friend who tags along with the main character because he's his friend, but is upset by all his antics and gets in trouble WITH him making him angrier at him. In the end though they stay friends and they both obtain success.
The girlfriend, the uncle, and the aunt, I can't really say much about. Like I said, they're nothing new or ground breaking but they're not BAD characters, they work in their roles, they play their parts WELL! They have fun lines! And in the end that's what they're MADE for, this movie isn't to develop characters, it's not to give the villain a redemption or challenge your brain, it's for fun, for laughs, and it does it well.
The story as well, like I said with the hero, the geeky underdog, a dreamer who can't achieve his dreams and looks like he never will, gets a chance at life, and even though he's failed at almost everything in life, he actually does well here because his weirdness and craziness is what people WANT. He shares comedy across his station and brings it back to life from the tiny rerun only station that it started as.
Then the BIG TV station, with it's corrupt owner gets angry at it's success, as THEIR station is now losing as the small one is winning. And they seek to destroy it, almost doing so, before being defeated last minute.
The acting as well is fun, it's not the BEST acting, but I didn't come here looking for that, if you did then, why? I mean I get that people want the best but really this is a Weird Al movie made to make you laugh and just be there to make you smile, it's not meant to have quality like The Godfather, Back to the Future, Jaws, E.T, etc. And the characters that are sprinkled around, like the crazy martial arts instructor, the animal guy, the scientist, etc are all VERY fun, even if they don't get that much screen time their time feels special and that makes it even more fun to see them.
If you don't like this movie, don't like it, okay, you're entitled to your opinion, but the comedy in this is just plain fun, it makes me laugh! And it's got more parodies in it than anything else I've ever seen, so yeah, it's a good movie in my eyes, and I recommend it! (Even thought Disney's Muppets movie in 2011 totally ripped off the ending- (I still love the Muppets with my whole heart and soul though)"
112,uhf,audience,3.0,p,Ok but entertaining kids movie. For me it's not that entertaining. It's basically what weird al normally does but instead of music it's the movies. He does it in an entertaining way but it feels like a distraction to the actual movie and it's better than the actual movie. It's a movie I'll probably forget in a day or two.

137,the_naked_gun_from_the_files_of_police_squad,audience,4.0,p,"Ridiculous gags and nonstop jokes.

David Zucker's absurdist crime comedy The Naked Gun (1988) is very funny with outrageous gags and creative visual direction that keeps you on your toes. If you look away from the screen for even a moment, you'll miss like 3 different jokes going on in the background. It's not as hilarious as Airplane! or Top Secret!, but The Naked Gun is still a classic comedy with plenty of laughs.

Leslie Nielsen can deliver any goofy or joke line in a perfectly serious deadpan voice and it is funny every time. He's so calm given all the strange and hilarious situations that I'm always entertained by Nielsen's shenanigans. Priscilla Presley is surprisingly funny and keeps up with Nielsen's absurd energy. You never buy their romance or like the endless string of sex jokes there for a quick crude laugh, but their comedic chemistry is more important. The Naked Gun has it all, even Top Secret! superfan Weird Al Yankovic!

Ricardo Montalban is excellent as the villain. His casual manner tells you everything you need to know with a more nuanced performance than some of the more colorful characters in The Naked Gun. George Kennedy plays a gung ho cop who just allows Nielsen to do whatever he wants with reckless abandon and it's great. I love how The Naked Gun cast O.J. Simpson just to beat the hell out of him.

Writers Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, and Pat Proft make efficient use of their 86 minutes to tell a silly story with as much visual flair and comedic insanity imaginable. I will not spoil anything in The Naked Gun, so that all the jokes are fresh, but I will say that the breakin and baseball gags are glorious.

In short, The Naked Gun will always be a comedy worth revisiting for a series of rapid fire laughs."

I did like the actual premise and was happy to see a movie with a nearly all-black cast be given the budget and promotional push this one had, and the supporting cast all did an excellent job with what little screentime they were left with after Eddie took his share."

169,coming_to_america,audience,4.5,p,"A very funny,ballsy well written comedy. I love how everyone expects great things from the big apple and then reality hits them in the face."
170,coming_to_america,audience,4.0,p,So funny and so many boobs at the beginning. Peak Eddy Murphy!
171,coming_to_america,audience,4.0,p,"Poverty for a reason.  So this is about the fabulously wealthy prince of Zamunda (Eddie Murphy).  His marriage has been arranged for him, as is the tradition in his family, but he doesn't want someone to marry him for his status.  Instead, he makes plans to come to New York City under the guise of being impoverished to meet a woman who will love him for who he is and not what he is.  Now, 80's comedies have always been a bit of a blind spot for me, and Coming to America was no exception.  I've caught a few clips on Comedy Central way back when, but I've never sat down and watched it from start to finish.  With a new sequel released this year, I felt like I couldn't watch it without first giving its predecessor a viewing.  While I can't say that I am holding high hopes for the sequel, I will at least be happy that it was the spur that got me to watch a great comedy that I should have seen decades ago.  An important thing to consider about this is that this movie was made back when Eddie Murphy was unstoppable.  I still have some holes to fill in his filmography, but he is inarguably one of the most acclaimed comedic voices of the 1980s, and this movie makes me want to go and watch all of his early films.  Nowadays, you're lucky if you get a watchable movie from him, but that is neither here nor there.  Much of this film gets by on Eddie Murphy's natural charisma, which is one of the biggest selling points about this film.  The character of Akeem that he plays has such a positive outlook and sunny disposition, he ends up being infectious.  I also think that he pairs very well with Arsenio Hall backing him up, and I enjoyed the chemistry they share.  I think my favorite scenes in this would have to be in the barbershop.  The dialogue exchanges are just so over the top, and when you factor in that 50% of the characters are played by Eddie Murphy in heavy makeup, it only adds to the humor.  I would go so far as to call Coming to America is a vintage classic, although I will say that it's not perfect.  Some of the African stereotypes didn't exactly age well, and when you break it down to the base elements, it's just a story of a guy duping and gaslighting a woman in his pursuit, which isn't exactly healthy behavior.  However, the joy is in the journey, and I can't see anybody having a bad time with this film."
172,coming_to_america,audience,1.5,n,"It hasn't aged well. It's not very funny and the second half drags so bad, I didn't even care to watch the last 20 minutes."

This is a comedy classic with John Witherspoon stealing the show. John Witherspoon was also a great live performer if you were lucky enough to see him. I watched him work over a drunk livid crowd who had been waiting for hours for a headliner that wasn't him. He was sweet, smooth, gracious, kind, and very funny (unlike the headliner). You can watch this one for the pure enjoyment of his scenes playing Dad."
199,friday,audience,2.0,n,"It has aged. The dialog was direct from elementary school. Sexist and not funny. When I saw the movie when it came out I liked it, but I was 13 years old then."
200,friday,audience,4.0,p,"It doesn't have the best direction and it can be understandable if some find the movie boring at times because it takes place almost entirely on Ice Cube's front porch but I can see why people enjoy Friday. It's quotable, has well-executed comedic sequences, boasts Chris Tucker at his funniest, features a ton of memorable characters and, when it drops the stoner comedy act, the dramatic scenes are admittedly quite strong without feeling like they came from a different movie. Friday isn't the best '90s comedy I've seen but it is still a classic in its own right."
201,friday,audience,3.5,p,"Friday is a hilarious movie. It has Ice cube and Chris Tucker. Chris’s character, Smokey, is so funny that I loved every scene with it. Deebo was so funny too. Ice cube’s character was so good, that he acted like it wasn’t even a movie. However, there were some characters that I thought were annoying or not funny. I am going to give Friday a: B+"
202,friday,audience,5.0,p,"The theatrical cut is the only version I feel is something worth watching the Director's cut is a disappointment of content that was better left on the cutting room floor. With that being said this is a cult classic and a breakthrough for the African American community as it has been well received by all walks and races this is sure to make you laugh, scream and cheer as Ice Cube and Chris Tucker make this a fun and enjoyable film. Along with the rest of the cast keeping the energy alive and fun."

5,raising_arizona,critics,fresh,p,"In their first masterpiece, the Coens first delight with sheer kinetics, then dazzle with colorful colloquialisms & verbal voodoo, and eventually disarm you with the grace and guile through which they examine modern foibles, failures and forgiveness."

9,raising_arizona,critics,fresh,p,"To their old fascination with Sunbelt pathology, to their side-winding Steadicam and pristine command of screen space, the Coens have added a robust humor, a plot that keeps outwitting expectations and a...dollop of sympathy for their forlorn kidnapers."

11,raising_arizona,critics,fresh,p,"The cartoon vision of southwestern tackiness doesn't cut very deep, but the mise-en-scene is packed with clever clutter."

13,raising_arizona,critics,rotten,n,"While film is filled with many splendid touches and plenty of yocks, it often doesn't hold together as a coherent story."
14,raising_arizona,critics,fresh,p,
15,raising_arizona,critics,fresh,p,"In a shrewdly calculated move to show their versatility, the Coens made this madcap comedy right after Blood Simple. If their debut was slow and spare, this one has breathneck pacing and hopping banter by terrific Holly Hunter and Nicolas Cage."

An eminently quotable film, Raising Arizona ended up becoming one of the most enduringly popular independent projects of the '80s, establishing to Coens as more than just violent thriller filmmakers and inspiring generations of offbeat humor at the movies. Infusing a penchant for unanswered questions and deeper subtext that goes well beyond a few well-designed chase scenes and self-references, Raising Arizona is a rare combination of smart writing, creative cinematography, and in particular brilliant casting, with great performances from John Goodman (just finding his footing as a beloved character actor), a tantalizingly underused Frances McDormand, and even a surprisingly competent turn from boxer Tex Cobb; of course, the leads are magnetic, with Cage's manic energy used for good and Hunter serving as his emotional foil. Mile-a-minute laughs, great physical comedy, and an offbeat sense of humor, making eccentricities into cinematic bread-and-butter; it's easy to see why there was conflict between an independently-minded Cage and the Coens given how meticulously the film is structured. Hardly a line in this film is a throwaway, and pairing that level of attention to detail with goofy characters is a wonderfully entertaining combination.

I know this is relevant to nothing, but I think it's funny how the poster for this film uses a safety pin to replace an 'A' in reference to diaper changing, and then in the film they explicitly bring up that the diapers used don't need safety pins. (4/5)"
23,raising_arizona,audience,5.0,p,"A great movie for sure! Very entertaining with a wild story. I really enjoyed it, and would definitely recommend it to anyone."
24,raising_arizona,audience,4.5,p,Movie Rating:   9/10
25,raising_arizona,audience,5.0,p,"Insane laughter will come out of you while watching The Coen Bros. hysterical farce.

Joel Coen's crime comedy Raising Arizona (1987) is The Coen Brothers firing on all cylinders as it is easily their fastest paced film with a breakneck speed. From Barry Sonnenfeld's cinematography blasting the camera down the highway and through homes for the chases all in close-up shots for a frenetic style to editor Michael R. Miller's sharply timed, rapid fire cuts for 94 minutes. Raising Arizona holds no quarter. 

Joel Coen's direction shoves you right into the crime world of petty robberies and baby theft with reckless abandon. He punches you in the face with jokes and it's simply hilarious. Joel and Ethan Coen's writing finds sincerity in a young couple's love of parenting, even if it's not their child. I honestly think many gags like John Goodman screaming in the rain after breaking out of prison clearly influenced The Shawshank Redemption to the grenade pin explosive finale right out of Leon The Professional proves how influential and beloved The Coen Brothers are to high caliber filmmakers. Raising Arizona is a farce, but a carefully made one with impeccably consistent jokes.

Nicolas Cage is crazy as the sincerely idiotic convenience store robber who falls in love with a police officer played by Holly Hunter. Their mania for a child is infectious as you always feel like they could conceivably care about this kid, even though they're incompetent. Cage and Hunter go 1000% with these performances and I'm grateful they went all out. Raising Arizona is much funnier because they are wildly overacting. 

Trey Wilson's unpainted furniture salesman is funny, but also surprisingly sincere. There is an actually earnest heartwarming vibe to this weird road adventure. John Goodman and William Forsythe's Southern escaped convicts are just too hilarious. Frances McDormand and M. Emmet Walsh's cameos are great, but it's the gigantic Randall ‘Tex' Cobb's motorcycle riding bounty hunter that steals every scene he's in as Raising Arizona is a bunch of character actors giving it their all.

Jane Musky's production design is even funny with junky looking trailer parks and suburban homes, especially with Robert Kracik's set decoration is very quaint. You've got to hear Carter Burwell's banjo heavy score. It's all bluegrass and country with high energy and insane twists on old songs. Richard Hornung's costumes make everyone look outrageous. Katherine James' make-up is very fun too.

In all, Raising Arizona is one of The Coen Brothers' funniest pictures."
26,raising_arizona,audience,4.5,p,Raising Arizona is a screwball comedy with a laugh a minute. My favorite line involves UFOs and had me pausing it to finish laughing.
27,raising_arizona,audience,5.0,p,just watched this again after 10 years. I forgot how funny it was. The dialogue. The cast. Just pure Coen Brothers. I actually love the narration. Just stunning.
28,raising_arizona,audience,4.5,p,Very good and charming movie. Characters are really fleshed out an their motives really drive the story.
29,raising_arizona,audience,4.0,p,"With a breakneck pace, Looney Tunes-esque ridiculously-exaggerated sound effects, boisterously rambunctious style, vertiginous camerawork and hysterical editing, I guess calling this batshit crazy Coens' crime comedy film a live-action cartoon wouldn't be preposterous. It's wild and quirky, but it's also extremely smart and clever in every respect. Just like a cartoon, it finds humor in the most horrifying scenes by hyperbolizing the violence to the brink of absurdity. But there's also boasts of that signature Coen brothers' stone-faced, deadpan humour here. Uses of repetition and refrains permeate the movie to produce some chuckles, but some of them are inextricably linked to the theme itself, most notably H.I. McDunnough's frequent run-ins with the law. Raising Arizona is also playful and cheeky, and I believe that is where it gains its heart. At the surface, the moments of emotional inertia are played for comedic effect, but they actually make room for H.I. McDunnough to reconsider and reevaluate the whole situation he and his wife are in after kidnapping the baby and ruminates over the consequences he regretfully waits. Nicholas Cage shines in these moments as his face that shows how bested by unavoidable fears he is juxtaposes the rather eccentrically affable atmosphere that predominates the entire movie. Holly Hunter's Ed, though, is the one who retains the emotional core of the movie that's ultimately unveiled by the end to hammer home the sweet message of the story. Hunter is phenomenal, and it's not her fault that the lunatic absurdism overshadowed the story's emotional beats every so often, the thing that made the movie a bit crude. Nevertheless, Raising Arizona is a fantastically maniac non-stop chase movie that's extremely heartfelt and kind at its essence, much like Gale and Evelle."

Christopher Reid, Christopher Martin, Martin Lawrence, Tisha Campbell-Martin, Robin Harris, and the rest of the cast did a great job in this movie.

It's worth watching."
51,house_party,audience,3.0,p,The original and the best.  The Hudson Brothers look at teen angst through the lens of stars Kid N Play.   Centered around a high school house party and the infinite quest for female companionship this one is funny and endearing.   Released in 1990 it is all 80's from mullets to the parachute pants.  The late Robbin Harris is great as a single Dad trying to set his son on The right path.  Good music.  Great cast.  Martin Lawrence steals the show.  I love the way the movie addresses racism and issues with the police- the contrast between Robin Harris' approach and the younger generation is very telling in light of the police response.   Nothing is better than a movie that uses laughter to make you think about more serious issues.

81,clueless,audience,5.0,p,Iconic! It's a really fun and well done movie and really a time capsule of 1990s teen culture. Worth watching and a great at home dinner date/make out movie.
82,clueless,audience,4.5,p,"Well executed over the top humor about the upper class. Also it's quotable. ""As if!"" to that. Very likeable characters and also an astounding performance from Alicia Silverstone and Paul Rudd.  Romance isn't that important to the story especially the first half. It's more about the character Cher herself. When the romance starts to truly kick off it's well executed.  All in all a very wholesome lighthearted movie that made at least me laugh. 

Also I noticed a small goof. I will only say side mirror."
83,clueless,audience,4.5,p,"I would say this film defines the 1990s and is the best teen film of this era. Alicia Silverstone plays Cher Horowitz, a Beverly Hills teenager who is living her best life and trying to help others find theirs."
84,clueless,audience,5.0,p,Absolute classic and one of my favourites. Good vibes and positive feel good movie.
85,clueless,audience,4.5,p,"This movie had an infectious positive energy that's hard to forget even weeks after I watched it. Silverstone has an incredible screen presence and magnetism here that reminded me a lot of Witherspoon's role in Legally Blonde a few years later. I've rarely seen a more likable main character in a movie, especially one in a high school setting. The supporting cast does a good job (especially Murphy) of propping Alicia up and the plot is pleasingly complex, even though I didn't totally agree with her stealing her brother from her friend like that."

88,clueless,audience,4.0,p,"Clueless is way more extraordinary than it appears, and is very strong evidence that one should not judge a book by its cover. On the outside, it appears like a sappy 90s teen film that nobody over the age of 20 could possibly enjoy, but inside it holds a very smart adaptation of Emma used to satirise modern American culture, including itself. Heckerling should be praised for this landmark picture in the strongest terms."
89,clueless,audience,4.5,p,Clueless is an excellent movie!!!!

115,austin_powers_international_man_of_mystery,audience,3.5,p,"I wish I'd been old enough to watch Austin Powers on release. It hit cinemas in the same year as one of my favourite Bond films, Tomorrow Never Dies, and understandably had paying punters rolling in the isles. Mike Myers' finest creation to date (although there's certainly an argument for Wayne's World) was the ultimate parody of the 007 behemoth, riffing heavily on Bond's ridiculous success with various women, as well as the over the top world dominating villain, complete with henchmen and women. Colourful, ludicrous, and very funny (the penis enlarger prop remains a personal highlight) Austin Powers was amusing enough and loveable to spawn two sequels, no mean feat for a comedy series that began life simply as a Bond rip off. Many have tried with varying success to use the Austin Powers model for their own ventures, none of which match the superiority of Myers character. Austin Powers wasn't the first spy spoof (Leslie Neilson's Spy Hard hit theatres a year previously in fact) but it was the the most successful critically and commercially until then, and remains wonderfully funny in 2021."

118,austin_powers_international_man_of_mystery,audience,2.5,n,"I don't think it'd be very fair to make a review on 'Austin Powers' as a movie, as it doesn't have any deep, emotional meaning to it. Instead, i'm going to review the movie based on the comedy and characters. 
Nope, sorry, still not a great movie. Most of the jokes and humour either rely on an awkward moment with repetition involved, or are just, 'Haha, funny s*x joke.' An example of this would be at the start of the movie when Austin Powers gets out of his freezing cell and has to exert his body fluids. The joke is that it has Austin peeing for a long amount of time, and the people around him just have to awkwardly stand here. There are many examples of this sort of joke happening throughout the movie. They overstay their welcome and It just feels like time padding. The second type of jokes are the s*x jokes. Most of them are fine, some of them fall flat, and then you have a character that's just called Alotta Fagina. Don't even get me started on the scene where Austin is in the bathtub with you know who. Every time that scene happens, I just skip it altogether. 
As for the characters, they're all really charming, especially Austin and Dr. Evil (since they're played by the same guy). Same can be said for every other character, even Vaneca, who at first I thought would just be bland, but she ended up having tiny bit of character in her.
Overall, I didn't find 'Austin Powers' necessarily bad or anything, I just found it had a lot of factors going against it. Despite my complaints, i wouldn't mind watching it again, and I do still recommend it."
119,austin_powers_international_man_of_mystery,audience,4.0,p,Witty but with heart (unlike the sequels) and mines lots of humour from its fish-out-of-water setup.
120,first_wives_club,critics,rotten,n,...generally feels like it could (and should) be so much better...
121,first_wives_club,critics,fresh,p,First Wives Club is something Hollywood hasn't produced since 9 to 5 some 16 years ago: a film exhilaratingly woman-positive and funny.
122,first_wives_club,critics,fresh,p,"For better or worse - more better than worse, though -The First Wives Club is peak 1990s feminist cinema."
123,first_wives_club,critics,rotten,n,"In the end, ""The First Wives Club"" even betrays its own bylaws. Revenge is a dish not served. Did Thelma and Louise make their sacrifice for nothing?"
124,first_wives_club,critics,fresh,p,"Smart and sassy, ""The First Wives Club"" is funny enough to amuse even the second wives."
125,first_wives_club,critics,rotten,n,"Oh, the stories Hawn, Midler and Keaton could tell about men. But we never get to hear them in ""The First Wives Clubs."" Instead, it's high jinks as they plot revenge, get the money."
126,first_wives_club,critics,fresh,p,"The dialogue is often silly but Bette Midler, Diane Keaton, and Goldie Hawn deliver it with enough crackerjack energy to keep audiences laughing."
127,first_wives_club,critics,rotten,n,Ultimately First Wives Club fails as a piece of feminist film-making just as miserably as it does as Hollywood entertainment.
128,first_wives_club,critics,fresh,p,"Those in seach of a classic adult comedy -- a latter-day version of ""The Women"" -- are urged to join the ""Club."""
129,first_wives_club,critics,rotten,n,"It's not much more than a variation on Nine to Five, with the object of revenge switched from a single boss to multiple husbands."
130,first_wives_club,critics,rotten,n,"[I]f you're expecting any savour of fin de siecle feminism more bracing than that peddled in, say, Nine to Five (which has much the same fundamental revenge premise), you'd be better off perusing the writings of Gloria Steinem."
131,first_wives_club,critics,rotten,n,"Starting over the top and wildly working its way upwards, The First Wives' Club eschews subtlety at all costs and is dogged by a number of out of place syrupy songs on the soundtrack."
132,first_wives_club,critics,rotten,n,"But despite the clever jabs, and even with cameo support from Ivana Trump and Gloria Steinern, the film's three stars still seem trapped by Hollywood formula-choked by the heavy-handed direction of Hugh Wilson, and a smarmy script by Robert Harling,"
133,first_wives_club,critics,rotten,n,"Although the movie presents itself as a ''hear me roar'' feminist statement, its view of humanity - both male and female - is so sour and artificial that the women characters come off almost as badly as the men do."
134,first_wives_club,critics,rotten,n,"The awful thing about this movie is that its stars, three of the best comic actresses in Hollywood, are reduced to bimbos too."
135,first_wives_club,critics,fresh,p,Terrific stuff.
136,first_wives_club,critics,rotten,n,"While the movie frequently gets things right, the big intricate revenge set-up in the second half is mishandled and muddled."
137,first_wives_club,critics,rotten,n,"And as just this, a simple vehicle for feminist rage, ""The First Wives Club"" is effective. The trouble is that the opportunity was here to say so much more."
138,first_wives_club,critics,rotten,n,"It pretends to sympathize with dumped women and displaced homemakers everywhere, but given these gals' level of obvious affluence, membership in ``The First Wives Club'' is quite exclusive."
139,first_wives_club,critics,fresh,p,"Yet the real genius of this saga of sisterhood ascendant is its, um, marriage of revenge fantasy and exuberant spirit."
140,first_wives_club,audience,3.5,p,"A pretty good a little silly rom-com comedy that's all right with me, it was fun to see the wives taking care of their cheating husbands."

This is a funny film showing off just how powerful women can be and turning something tragic into something wonderful.  Hawn, Midler and Keaton work well together whilst everyone else almost pales into the background.  Lovely story with a lovely ending - and off course, Bette's beautiful voice!"

152,thin_man,critics,fresh,p,This film has the unusual merit of combining exciting adventure and genuine comedy. The two are so cleverly managed that the one never gets in the way of the other.
153,thin_man,critics,fresh,p,[An] exceptionally good movie...
154,thin_man,critics,fresh,p,"Powell and Loy were one of the greatest screen couples, their cinematic compatibility epitomized here with this second collaboration."
155,thin_man,critics,fresh,p,This classic clicks on all cylinders.
156,thin_man,critics,fresh,p,[Hammett's] book has been adapted to the screen with an intelligent respect for the original spirit and tempo. The dialogue is bright and sophisticated; and Miss Loy and William Powell carry the thing off with a light touch and a great deal of gaiety.
157,thin_man,critics,fresh,p,"The Thin Man is just about as good a mystery story as anyone could ask for. That is to say, it keeps you happily amused all the time it is keeping you anxiously waiting."
158,thin_man,critics,fresh,p,"Don't spare the enthusiasm on this one because if the book had thousands of readers, this picture will have millions of customers - well satisfied and with that well-fed look."
159,thin_man,critics,fresh,p,One of the most popular comedies ever made.
160,thin_man,critics,fresh,p,"Tense and slick, this early thriller remains a true masterpiece."
161,thin_man,critics,fresh,p,"Truly, a film in which there is never a dull moment."
162,thin_man,critics,fresh,p,"There's wonderful chemistry between William Powell and Myrna Loy, who make sleuthing, marriage and drinking cool and sexy"
163,thin_man,critics,fresh,p,"The Thin Man was an entertaining novel, and now it's an entertaining picture."
164,thin_man,critics,fresh,p,A style of pure ebullience
165,thin_man,critics,fresh,p,"As charming as its headliners are, The Thin Man is brought down to the merely solid level by its flimsy narrative."
166,thin_man,critics,fresh,p,One can't say enough good things about the playful interplay between Powell and Loy.
167,thin_man,critics,fresh,p,"What enchants, really, is the relationship between Nick and Nora as they live an eternal cocktail hour, bewailing hangovers that only another little drink will cure, in a marvellous blend of marital familiarity and constant courtship."

169,thin_man,critics,rotten,n,"The Thin Man, produced way back in 1934, just isn't that funny any more."
170,thin_man,audience,4.0,p,"""Waiter, will you serve the nuts. I mean will you serve the guests the nuts.""

I had realized this was a complete cultural blindspot for me recently during a Final Jeopardy clue with an answer of Asta, which still didn't ring the slightest bell of recognition when revealed. Although I have read some novels by Hammett in the past, I somehow totally missed this work, or even any reference to it in popular culture.

The dialogue and banter was exquisite, and nearly relegated the mystery to an afterthought. The back and forth between Powell and Loy continuously reminded me of Hepburn and Grant in Bringing Up Baby.

I also couldn't help making comparisons to the immense, and to me somewhat surprising, popularity of Knives Out a few years back and each provide evidence that there will probably always be a healthy appetite for the lighthearted whodunit.

While Powell and Loy carry the film it goes without saying that Asta takes the MVP. 7.5/10"
171,thin_man,audience,4.0,p,"WS Van Dyke's The The Man is a clever crime mystery wrapped in a light romantic comedy, so Dashiell Hammett's story and characters deserve at least as much credit as Van Dyke and the producer Stromberg.  It's got a pleasing cinematography that highlights the Art Deco sets with distance shots and the sharp dialogue with close-ups.  The famous William Powell - Myrna Loy relationship works, they are a great and convincing screen couple, and the film is better whenever Loy is on screen.  The constant boozing, used to create a certain effect, comes across as annoying and affected in our day."
172,thin_man,audience,4.0,p,"Sparklingly witty dialogue between the cocktail-slurping leads in a fun, lighthearted mystery."
173,thin_man,audience,4.0,p,"This murder mystery is fine, but what really impressed me about The Thin Man is the relationship between the characters of Nick & Nora. It's an absolute delight to watch William Powell and Myrna Loy play off of each other with witty banter and even simple facial expressions. I would have liked to see more of it, actually. Now I understand why this movie launched an entire film series."
174,thin_man,audience,4.0,p,"Based on the Dashiell Hammett novel, Nick Charles is a retired detective who is asked to investigate a case of a rich, eccentric inventor who failed to return from an announced trip. Living the high life thanks to his heiress wife Nora, Nick initially refuses, but he is slowly drawn in, thanks to the encouragement of his wife who wants to be a detective too, as well as an invasion of his apartment by a suspect, and pressures from both the police and the man's family.

The movie is played for laughs, which is good as banter between husband and wife, as well as the other characters, works well. Yet the movie has serious parts such as graphic killings, and the serious aspects of the movie are downplayed. The movie could have had both the comedy and the tension that would have come with a more serious treatment of the story."
175,thin_man,audience,5.0,p,A Masterpiece. 93 minutes on edge of seat for next turn of events. Comedy mixed with mystery progressing at fast pace is just mind blowing. Class apart & probably the best B&W film I have ever seen.
176,thin_man,audience,4.0,p,"A comedy-detective but far from buffoonish franchise that all but disappeared from the memory of popular culture, The Thin Man places far greater emphasis on the journey that it takes than its actual reveal. While the mystery itself isn't necessarily predictable, you aren't picking out clues from the actions of the film's diverse cast of characters as much as you are enjoying the banter and pure charm of Powell and Loy as Nick and Nora, a pair of silver-tongued investigators who play off each other epertly without being derogatory. The story is classic but somewhat shaky, focusing on the disappearance of a subject who you have little justification to care about and several potential suspects who are given only brief snippets of screentime just to provide potential directions for the inevitable finale to go in. But the two leads bring so much entertainment value to the film that you won't much care as to the narrative as long as it gives more opportunity for the pair to shoot balloons with air pistols while lounging in pajamas and tossing witticisms back and forth. (4/5)"
177,thin_man,audience,5.0,p,The first film of one of my favorite film series.
178,thin_man,audience,5.0,p,"Absolutely brilliant snappy dialog of a bygone era where everyone drank martinis and dressed like every day was an important occasion. The film is full of great quips:
Reporter: Nick, can you tell us anything about the case?
Nick: Yes it's putting me way behind in my drinking."
179,thin_man,audience,3.5,p,"Absolutely hilarious movie. I love the chemistry between Nick and Nora and their dog, Asta is adorable! A definite classic!"
180,abbott_and_costello,critics,fresh,p,"Were it not for the goofy leads, this could very well be yet another chapter in the series of classic monster mashups, which had fizzled out of theaters a few years prior."
181,abbott_and_costello,critics,fresh,p,"Even those of us who find Bud and Lou's antics more dated than those of, say, Laurel and Hardy or the Marx Brothers, can still enjoy this one, because the monsters are a hoot."
182,abbott_and_costello,critics,fresh,p,"It may prove a less satisfying offering than usual to devotees of the slim and stocky funsters. Abbott and Costello prevail, however, over the chilly doings of such competent scare artists as Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney."
183,abbott_and_costello,critics,rotten,n,The first of three films to pair the comedy team with Universal's monsters. Moderately amusing.
184,abbott_and_costello,critics,fresh,p,"A masterpiece filled with raucous laughs, great spooks, and a wicked final scene."
185,abbott_and_costello,critics,fresh,p,"This is the best of the boys' efforts, allowing them to go for the nyuks yet never diminishing the standing of the classic Universal Studios monsters that figure in its plot."
186,abbott_and_costello,critics,fresh,p,While the the film is representative of the absolute worst of Universal horror... it is one of the very best Abbott and Costello vehicles.
187,abbott_and_costello,critics,fresh,p,Well-constructed and satisfyingly low
188,abbott_and_costello,critics,fresh,p,
189,abbott_and_costello,critics,fresh,p,"It's ridiculous, of course, but the combination of classic monsters, dizzy sets and some of Bud and Lou's funniest bits make it a keeper."
190,abbott_and_costello,critics,fresh,p,The comedy duo's finest onscreen hour comes in the shape of this wonderful horror spoof which also unites all of Universal's scariest horror heroes under the same cinematic roof.
191,abbott_and_costello,critics,fresh,p,A little bit of going through the motions with this horror spoof but fans will enjoy
192,abbott_and_costello,critics,fresh,p,"After this film's considerable success at the box office, Abbott and Costello made seven more pictures in which they 'met' Hollywood monsters, but none were as lively and entertaining as this one."
193,abbott_and_costello,critics,rotten,n,"This 1948 effort is probably the last of their watchable films, though it's a long way from their best."
194,abbott_and_costello,critics,rotten,n,"The notion of having these two clowns run afoul of the famous screen monster is a good laugh in itself. But take this gentle warning: get the most out of that one laugh while you can, because the picture, at Loew's Criterion, does not contain many more."
195,abbott_and_costello,critics,fresh,p,"THE best of Abbott and Costello's zany films, this time with Lugosi and Chaney playing their monsters seriously, which makes A&C's reactions hilarious."
196,abbott_and_costello,critics,fresh,p,Classic horror movie spoof.
197,abbott_and_costello,critics,fresh,p,The best of all the 35 Abbott and Costello movies made between 1940 and 1956.
198,abbott_and_costello,critics,fresh,p,One of the funniest comedies in the couple's long series of films that use Universal's classic horrors.

201,abbott_and_costello,audience,4.0,p,"Probably the best of the latter Universal films. In black and white the comedy was funnier, in black and white the horror was scarier. All involved are great. Always loved Lon Chany Jr. As the wolfman. He's fantastic. The horror is played straight. But the comedy is still funny. That's the way I like it."
202,abbott_and_costello,audience,5.0,p,"Classic monsters & classic comedy, in one movie? Yes!! And don't listen to any rubbish reviews that tell you the monsters have been reduced to buffoonery. Abbott & Costello are at their best, & so are the monsters! What more can one ask for!"

204,abbott_and_costello,audience,5.0,p,"It's a perfectly constructed horror-comedy movie...a combination of the Universal monsters world and the best comedy duo of the 40s and 50s.  Stay tuned to the very last scene to check the box of all monsters to appear in the movie.  And you have Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney Jr., and listen for a cameo of Vincent Price!"
205,abbott_and_costello,audience,4.0,p,My favorite of their films.
206,abbott_and_costello,audience,3.0,p,Classic Abbott and Costello. The second and final appearance of Lugosi as Dracula. Decent B-movie. Disregards where these characters are at the end of House of Dracula.
207,abbott_and_costello,audience,3.0,p,"Though a very funny film, it would be nice if Frankenstein was in it a bit more."
208,abbott_and_costello,audience,2.5,n,"Zany is a good word, but it's fun to see all the horror characters and famous actors in one ridiculous movie."
209,abbott_and_costello,audience,3.5,p,It's a fun monster mash and Abbott and Costello are great as always.

2,bridget_jones_diary,critics,rotten,n,"When rendered in visual terms, many of the most delicious qualities of Bridget Jones's Diary also become highly smelly, like a wedge of cheese that's overstayed its welcome."
3,bridget_jones_diary,critics,fresh,p,This is a picture that gets right down to the brass tacks of singleton urban living for women in their 30s.
4,bridget_jones_diary,critics,fresh,p,"It's fine, for an evening, if you just want to pack your troubles in an old kit bag."
5,bridget_jones_diary,critics,rotten,n,"The film is excessively, parochially British at its periphery, yet insufficiently so at its core."
6,bridget_jones_diary,critics,fresh,p,That Zellweger can make us believe in Bridget's heaving inner world is par for the course -- she's a supremely talented comic actress. That she was willing to risk her own status as sex symbol by looking like an everywoman is really impressive.
7,bridget_jones_diary,critics,fresh,p,
8,bridget_jones_diary,critics,fresh,p,A blessed reminder of just how good -- and how pointed -- British comedies can be.
9,bridget_jones_diary,critics,fresh,p,"Oh, such fun for older teens!"
10,bridget_jones_diary,critics,fresh,p,"Casting Renee Zellweger as this British icon drew plenty of flak. But she proved impossible to not root for while flashing a sweet smile, bunching her body up in a ""right-o, old chap"" shoulder shrug and waddle-walking in unflattering panties and girdles."
11,bridget_jones_diary,critics,fresh,p,"Just seconds into Sharon Maguire's adaptation of Helen Fielding's beloved novel, it's hard to imagine that there was such controversy surrounding the casting of Renee Zellweger."
12,bridget_jones_diary,critics,rotten,n,"Provides a few laughs but failed to make me care on which loves-me, loves-me-not petal this film ends."
13,bridget_jones_diary,critics,fresh,p,"A cheerfully frothy romantic comedy that benefits from sharp writing, lively performances and touching characterisation."
14,bridget_jones_diary,critics,rotten,n,"As a film, however, item misses its mark, failing to capitalize on the staccato rhythms and sardonic wit of Bridget's inner life."
15,bridget_jones_diary,critics,rotten,n,It's so aggressive you don't even have to like it; the movie likes itself well enough for the both of you.
16,bridget_jones_diary,critics,rotten,n,The filmmakers are uncritically in love with their heroine and her milieux and have romanticised them to an almost laughable degree.
17,bridget_jones_diary,critics,fresh,p,"Renee Zellweger, a born Texan, not only nails the most beloved woman of modern British fiction but embodies and owns her."
18,bridget_jones_diary,critics,fresh,p,"Ms. Zellweger makes the most of what she's given and manages to triumph time and again over her pratfalls and public rump displays. In a word, she's terrific."

20,bridget_jones_diary,audience,4.0,p,"Zellwegger does well as a sympathetic, funny character.  It is a sentimental and feel good movie.   There are some sly references to Pride and Prejudice.  When we see her singing along with the radio ""All By Myself"" we know she is destined to find someone who loves here.  Hugh Grant plays Daniel who is a disaster with a nice voice and a terrible character.  I enjoyed seeing Bridget fall for him as much as I enjoyed seeing her tell him off.  Darcy turns out to have more tenderness and humor."
21,bridget_jones_diary,audience,3.0,p,3.25. Compared to other British romantic comedies this one was good but not great. Also is it British grammar why it's Bridget Jones's v. Bridget Jones?
22,bridget_jones_diary,audience,3.5,p,"A million years late, I found Bridget's Diary pretty funny - like a modern Jane Austen moment. I can see why it was popular and I'll be interested to see if it warrants both sequels."
23,bridget_jones_diary,audience,3.5,p,"Loosely based on the old novel, this is the story about Bridget Jones, a thirtysomething British woman who is mateless and unhappy with her life, and keeps said diary to try to improve herself. The story begins when Bridget is invited to her parent's home on Christmas Day, and is introduced to a wealthy man named Mr. Darcy whom she dislikes. Later at her workplace at a publishing house, she describes the colleagues she also dislikes, and her boss has his eye upon her, and he seems charming. But she finds that he and the other man have a dispute between them, and her own boss perhaps is not the nice person he seems to be. Then Bridget's own mother has her own midlife crisis and is unhappy with her family...

An entertaining story, if a bit too full of bad language. There is sexuality, but the only very brief sex scene does provide the necessary shock value for the plot. Recommended, but for nobody younger than in their teens."
24,bridget_jones_diary,audience,4.5,p,Very funny and witty.
25,bridget_jones_diary,audience,0.5,n,"This movie is awful. Not only is it awful, it's downright insulting. The plot is insane and makes no sense from start to finish. The ending is not only stupid but actually sad - only it was supposed to be happy. To go into more detail, let's talk about the characters, since, to me at least, they are the main charm of rom-coms.
Bridget Jones is the most insufferable stereotype of a woman I have ever witnessed in media. She somehow manages to make the worst choices in every situation. Why go into television, and more specifically current news, if you're ALWAYS unaware of current affairs? Her character is honestly insulting to witness.
Mark Darcy may be good at his heart, but he is rude and I really do not understand why he's supposed to be a good pair with Bridget. This is why the ending was sad. She could've found literally ANY other man.
Daniel Cleaver... Well, he's supposed to be hateable, but he's so stereotyped and bland that I don't have much to say about him. I don't care about him. I ended up hating Mark more than him because Daniel is so... forgettable.
Bridget's father is alright, but the fact he got back with Bridget's mother after she literally left their house for the first man to notice her? And her asking HIM to make the effort after she literally cheated on him? No. That alone made me dislike them both.
There are only two good things I can say about this movie. It was funny as hell. When it wasn't too busy being nonsensical and insulting, it was very very funny. But that doesn't excuse the characters and shenanigans of the story itself. And the actors give great performances despite the poor character writing.

Tl;dr : This movie was very funny, but also stupid and insulting. ""Women are stupid and depend on men, and men are either bastards or pushovers"", says this movie."
26,bridget_jones_diary,audience,1.0,n,I went into this film with the recommendation that it was the best that Rom-Coms could offer. This was the most dissapointed ive been for a film in years. Nothing was redeemable.

59,national_lampoons_vacation,audience,4.5,p,"When this movie is good, it is so so very good. Unfortunately there's about 20% of the movie that's just not very good, but it's surrounded by enough laughs that it's still really enjoyable. Chevy Chase plays the perfectly optimistic dad, and the whole family is relatable enough that the humor can hit a few notes at once. It does get away from itself a bit at the end, but it's a comedy so you can't take it too seriously. Overall I loved all of the dry humor, and the ""wet"" (?) humor was fine but a little forced. I can see why this one is a classic though."

It's the 90s so one 40 year old guy is dating a 24 year old underwear model and some schlep ends up with the hot woman on the cattle drive. Ridiculous and  yeah film is ruined by that kind of nonsense."
81,city_slickers,audience,3.5,p,"Movie will be out of 62 points
This movie is good, but it definitely has a lot of slow parts in it. I wished the movie was a bit more exciting when the cast was in the West, as there was no energy for me even when the characters were there. I liked Billy Crystal in this film. He was really funny and the rest of the cast was good too. I thought Jack Palance as Curly was good. He did win an Oscar for this film, but I don't agree with his win. being that to me he did not have a moving experience, and he had very little screen time, for me to judge. The movie definitely has some silly parts, like when Billy Crystal helps give birth a cow. That part  made me laugh a lot! It was mostly very entertaining of a film, and I did like it! It was also very fast-paced despite with some slow moments!
Final grade: 45/62= 73% C-
It was very good, but definitely not my cup of tea. I did find Billy Crystal funny, and the other actors were good too. Is it a movie I'd recommend? Yes, if you like Westerns. However, for anyone else, people are just gonna find it really stupid."

83,city_slickers,audience,3.5,p,"It's a well-done 90s comedy. Strange to watch now after considering this ""grown up stuff"" when released and now relating to mid-life concerns of the trio"
84,city_slickers,audience,3.0,p,"Even city folk need a change of scenery and perspective 
Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern, Jack Palance, and Bruno Kirby
This comedy executive produced by Crystal focuses on three friends taking a vacation away from their wives
This year, henpecked Phil, newly married Ed, and Mitch whos 39 and feels like he's reached his peak-- terrified of his midlife crisis -- decide to reignite their masculinity by taking a supervised cattle drive across the Southwest
Under the supervision of gruff cowboy Curly all 3 of these men set out on a journey that turns unexpectedly dangerous
They bond along the way to conquering their fear of aging
Sometimes we need to find our smile, we need to jump off that bridge when we come to it, we have to get our feet wet so we can sit back in the saddle
There's not a whole lot of laughs in here but more drama 
It's a bumpy ride with a lot of shifts in tone and it's a bit lengthy 
All about these men coming to terms with their failures and having a complete do-over 
This cattle lifestyle might be the one thing for them to rise up and forget their troubles 
Crystal, Stern, and Kirby keep things running smooth with their believable friendship 
Not a great comedy by any means but harmless enough"

87,city_slickers,audience,2.0,n,"City Slickers is a classic fish out of water story with a big heart, though these fish spend some serious time in water at the end of the movie. It's a light, occasionally funny romp through cowboy country. The thing that impressed me most was the cattle scenes and the direction requires to put together those set pieces. Billy Crystal does his usual schtick, which is good up to a certain point."
88,city_slickers,audience,5.0,p,The funniest treasure-hunting comedy ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!
89,city_slickers,audience,3.0,p,"It’s kind of weird returning to City Slickers now that I’m actually older than the characters in the film. I can appreciate some of the stress that comes with getting older, and I guess I understand the desire to seek out adventure before it’s too late in life. It does seem like the message of this movie is fairly vague, bordering on being a complete cop-out that dodges any true moral, and therefore it lacks some of the emotional punch I was expecting. I enjoy all the camaraderie between the main characters, and seeing how they grow closer through this adventure. I’m not sure I fully believe that they could become as good at herding cattle as they seem to get in a matter of days in this film, but it certainly gives a triumphant tone to the end of the story. Unfortunately, that tone lasts less time than I expected, and never feels fully satisfying. There’s no doubt that City Slickers is an entertaining movie, and it works because the 3 best friends all have charm and good chemistry with one another. I like the diverse characters we see from Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern, and Bruno Kirby. I’m not sure all the humor in the film works, though. There are several moments where I chuckled, but it fell short of laugh-out-loud funny. Of course, I have seen the film before and knew most of the jokes were coming, so perhaps the humor just lacks the kind of punch needed for repeated laughs. The strangest attempt at humor is just Billy Crystal’s repeated nasal “Hello.” I’m not even sure why that’s supposed to be funny, but he goes there again and again. On the whole, City Slickers is still a decent comedy-adventure film that explores the causes and effects of a man’s mid-life crisis. It’s not an all-time classic, but certainly worth watching."

The actual story is very familiar and doesn't offer much new in terms of jokes, reusing from many other comedies at the time, just slightly changing them. However, despite it's glaring flaws, ""Tommy Boy"" was just a fun film to turn your brain off to and watch just for fun, not to mention how great the cast plays their over-the-top characters.

142,1015380-odd_couple,audience,3.5,p,"""YOU ASKED FOR IT. YOU'RE A WONDERFUL GUY, OSCAR.""

One of the most well-known and successful comedies of the partnership between Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, The Odd Couple isn't as fast-paced as modern examples of the genre tend to be (and slower than the screwballs that preceded it) and requires a bit of adjusting as a result, but is suprisingly wholesome and entertaining for a buddy film that uses a collapsing marriage and a suicide attempt as its starting bell. The balance between Lemmon's jittery high-strung energy and Matthau's heavily accented sluggishness is still a winner, pairing well with their husband/wife roleplaying that you can manage would have been more endearing as a comedy of manners in the conservative '60s. The ending is pretty anticlimactic all things considered, but this is still a solid film despite showing some of its age. And at $1.50/hour, Lemmon's deep-cleaning services are a bargain. 

As a side note, this might be the earliest film I can recall with an end-credits gag, intentionally mixing up and 'correcting' the actresses of the identical twin sisters that take in Felix in his hour of need. (3.5/5)"
143,1015380-odd_couple,audience,4.0,p,its a good one for me
144,1015380-odd_couple,audience,3.0,p,"Based on Neil Simon's 1965 play of the same name, Gene Saks's adaptation of ""The Odd Couple"" features a characteristically amusing pair of performances in the form of Jack Lemmon as Felix Ungar and Walter Matthau as Oscar Madison. However, beyond a few smile-inducing exchanges and a couple of clever sight gags, I just simply didn't find this to be all that funny. This isn't to say that the material at hand is chock-full of swings and misses or offensive subject matter or anything. I guess what I'm saying is, no one told me that this was more of a dramedy than a straight-up, straight-laced comedy. Indeed, Lemmon and Matthau are fun to watch together, with their onscreen chemistry comprising the key factor of enjoyment for me. There's just not really that much else here for my comedic tastes. Killer theme song, though."

156,burn_after_reading,critics,fresh,p,"Burn After Reading is a sort of anti-All the President's Men, a Washington movie whose unstated premise is that we should never attribute to malice that which can be explained by stupidity."
157,burn_after_reading,critics,rotten,n,"Intended as a pastiche of those grim Washington paranoia movies, it's almost as if that strived-for drabness drains the film of any real intent. It's patently unfunny too."
158,burn_after_reading,critics,rotten,n,"What Burn After Reading offers is hollow, not especially insightful comedy about self-involved people whose ugly ambitions intersect and then end in brain-splattering mayhem."
159,burn_after_reading,critics,fresh,p,"This is rather trivial territory for the Coens and the cast, but everyone involved is clearly having a good time."
160,burn_after_reading,critics,fresh,p,Take a crazy pill or two and let Burn After Reading entertain for a few hours...
161,burn_after_reading,critics,fresh,p,A hilarious and intelligent comedy and a worthy new member of the Coens' tradition of excellence.
162,burn_after_reading,critics,fresh,p,"Burn After Reading is a comedy that makes fun of almost everything, reminding you that almost none of it is laughing matter."
163,burn_after_reading,critics,fresh,p,"The Coens are having none of it. The dopes we encounter every day are the real dopes, the creeps are the real creeps, the people in and around power who seem so stupid and venal really are stupid and venal..."
164,burn_after_reading,critics,rotten,n,"A statement on imperial power and its sledgehammer approach to human life? Sure, why not. By the end, audiences will be as indifferent as the filmmakers."
165,burn_after_reading,critics,rotten,n,"Quite a downer concept for a comedy, however black. Which is probably why it isn't very funny."
166,burn_after_reading,critics,rotten,n,"Although there are a couple of vaguely amusing moments, it fails as a comedy because it just isn't funny, and it fails as a thriller because it just isn't suspenseful and it fails as entertainment of any kind because it is all so ludicrously improbable."
167,burn_after_reading,critics,fresh,p,"It's not for everyone, or funny all the time, but it's worth it for the performances, the cast, the cinematography and of course the complicated and even absurd plot. [Full review in Spanish]"
168,burn_after_reading,critics,fresh,p,"Snark maybe is as snark does, but aren't there cases where snark is justified?"
169,burn_after_reading,critics,rotten,n,"Yet again the Coens parade a carnival of stupidity before us, another cavalcade of caricatured schmucks, imbeciles and idiots."
170,burn_after_reading,audience,2.5,n,"5.7/10 — ""Mediocre""/""Passable"""
171,burn_after_reading,audience,3.5,p,"Sure, the plot of Burn After Reading is ludicrous, filled with absurd coincidences and highly improbable scenarios, but rarely has something so ludicrous been so entertaining.  Centering around a former CIA agent's lost computer disc containing a portion of his memoir, this Coen brothers' offering features an all-star cast, including Frances McDormand, Brad Pitt, George Clooney, John Malkovich, Tilda Swinton and J.K. Simmons, among others.  It's a classic Coen brothers ‘fish out of water/in over your head' story, like Fargo or No Country for Old Men, with characters pinballing their way through impossible situations, not fully understanding the impact of their actions on others.  The acting is uniformly great and the dialogue is fantastic as the Coens prove once again that even an average film by the brothers is better than most other movies by a significant margin."
172,burn_after_reading,audience,3.5,p,"It's basically a good screwball comedy, with occasional moments of a spy thriller and a recurring thread of poignant humanity as the deeply wounded and colorful characters reveal their weaknesses and struggles.  It is animated by clever plot twists but is worth watching mostly for the outstanding acting.  McDormand, Malkovich, Clooney, Pitt and Swinton are great."
173,burn_after_reading,audience,4.0,p,"This movie was an absolute hoot. I haven't laughed that hard in a movie in a long time and that's a good thing because other than laughs this movie doesn't offer much but I guess that's because it's entire offering is laughs. All that to say this movie was hilarious, shocking and absolutely bonkers and I loved it. I can really get behind a movie that sets up an elaborate house of cards just to send it crashing down in the most fun way possible even if that's all it does. The art of being genuinely smart and actually funny is an enviable and applaudable thing and I can't help but give the Coen brothers all the credit for one of the greatest houses of cards I have ever had the distinct pleasure of watching. The movie just gets faster and faster and more and more ridiculous and then it all finally goes up in the best way. But it wasn't just the plot and dialogue, the actors add a special spice of their own. They are obviously having a ton of fun with this movie and the ridiculousness of the characters makes for some of the hammiest and silliest performances I've seen. Brad Pitt was my personal favorite, this guy is unbelievable. Every action, word and glance from Pitt was spot on and hilarious and he definitely had my favorite line in a movie that is really quotable (Osbourne Cox? I thought you might be worried… about the security… of your S***). Next is George Clooney who spirals with such over the top gusto that it's a wonder to behold. Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, Tilda Swinton, all so excellent and the icing on the cake: a drole helping of J.K Simmons. The one criticism that I would have for this movie, and with ""house of cards"" movies in general is that by design, the audience is left with nothing at all substantive to walk out with except a vague feeling of emptiness (this criticism can be leveled at a lot of the Coen's work too). What makes this worse is that this movie ends with a particularly nasty murder with a hatchet, which is certainly a grim send off and the worst shock in a movie peppered with them. I guess that's not even true about the ending. The scene is actually pretty funny (they say Tarantino is the master of funny violence but the Coens could give him a run for his money) and it's not the last scene of the movie. In the actual last scene, J.K. Simmons gives a perfect summation of how to walk away from this movie: 
""What did we learn palmer?
I don't know, sir.
I don't f*****' know either. I guess we learned not to do it again. 
Yes, sir.
I'm f***** if I know what we did.
Yes, sir, it's, uh, hard to say.""
And there you go. You win again Coen brothers. How do you guys do it?"
174,burn_after_reading,audience,2.5,n,"This is a disappointing Coen Brothers film. Somehow the plot called for more seriously played characters as Malkovich did in playing the fired CIA analyst which makes his character, Osbourne Cox, not only darkly comedic but also relatable. I just couldn't quite connect with the other characters."
175,burn_after_reading,audience,3.5,p,"good beginning, good middle, good end, good acting, good movie. if all online streaming/services were to end today, this is one i would buy a hard copy of for my new collection."
176,burn_after_reading,audience,4.0,p,JK Simmons makes this movie worth watching 😄
177,burn_after_reading,audience,4.0,p,"Splendid performances uplift a sharp spy spoof!

Joel and Ethan Coen's espionage comedy Burn After Reading (2008) is a blast as The Coen Brothers send up the entire spy genre. Joel and Ethan Coen's writing is quite striking as they find ways to connect seemingly unrelated people all in the same conspiracy of confidential information. Burn After Reading's narrative starts out simple enough, then devolves into controlled chaos as these significant figures all cross paths in one delightful espionage farce. The Coen Brothers direct Burn After Reading by divining glee from the misery of each of these ridiculously over the top characters, while establishing the growing sense of paranoia like any great paranoia thriller of old with spies, information, and government hush ups. While not the funniest Coen Bros. picture, it's one of their silliest and easily enjoyable.

Brad Pitt steals the show as this jerkoff fitness instructor, who mostly just exercises himself rather than help anyone else. Pitt's Chad Feldheimer character is completely selfish, idiotic, and an opportunist. I want more comedy roles from the great dramatic actor Brad Pitt as it's hysterical watching Pitt's stupid dance, outrageous workouts, and goofy physical comedy moments. John Malkovich is so great as the easily furious, alcoholic government agent Osborne Cox. His depression after getting demoted and quitting is hilarious. Malkovich's sudden rage is sublimely entertaining, especially during Burn After Reading's shocking finale.

George Clooney is excellent as the womanizing piece of trash cheater Harry Pfarrer. His charismatic flirting is funny, but it's Clooney's blowhard attitude that is so fun about his character. His suave delivery and perfect comedy timing is always a pleasure to watch. Frances McDormand is really fun as fitness instructor Linda Litzke, who desperately wants plastic surgery even at the cost of blackmail. Her nervous and precise faces let you know exactly how frustrated, scared, or hopeful she is at all times. 

Tilda Swinton is fantastic as the commanding lady Katie Cox, who gleefully deplores John Malkovich's Osborne, while fawning over the scumbag George Clooney's Harry. Richard Jenkins' pathetically in love Ted is excellent as he can never say how he feels. Elizabeth Marvel is wonderful as the bored with her marriage children's author Sandy Pfarrer. J.K. Simmons is just amazing as the nonchalant government official.

Joel and Ethan Coen's editing is super fastly cut, giving Burn After Reading an ultra fast pace, which is unique for a Coen Brothers film. It hardly feels its brief 96 runtime. Emmanuel Lubezki's stunning cinematography plays around with close-ups capturing feet stepping or eyes peering from behind a closet door to a wide shot of an axe crushing a man's skull. All the humor from The Coen Brothers' smart script gets laughs out of these goofy to hilarious shots. Jess Gonchor's production design gives Washington D.C. a sterile look, all clean and tidy. Nancy Haigh's set decoration creates fancy home furnishings to dismal average house looks. Randall Balsmeyer and Adrienne Winterhalter's visual effects for the crucial gunshot is explosive with a gritty realism to the axe stabs into the head.

Carter Burwell's score is playful and exciting that keeps pace with Burn After Reading's insane story satirizing government clean ups and how easily information can spread. Mary Zophres' costumes are so seriously outlandish for Brad Pitt's fitness trainer to Tilda Swinton's dressy suits, you'll love them!

In short, Burn After Reading aged well from a decently funny comedy to a brilliantly executed spoof of espionage films."
178,burn_after_reading,audience,3.5,p,offbeat fun. liked it a lot. story is spotty at times.
179,burn_after_reading,audience,3.5,p,Total sleeper! I was pleasantly surprised at this movie. Definitely a funny movie!
180,his_girl_friday,critics,fresh,p,Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant are perfectly paired. Their comedy performances set a new speed record on the screen.
181,his_girl_friday,critics,fresh,p,"There are few breathing spells in His Girl Friday. The film starts out at a breakneck speed, and continues it all the way through."
182,his_girl_friday,critics,fresh,p,"It is with a great deal of envy that this real Girl Friday reports on the reel Girl Friday who cavorts on the [screen in] His Girl Friday. We can only say: It must have been wonderful to work in the ""dark ages"" of newspapering."
183,his_girl_friday,critics,fresh,p,Miss Russell's lively interpretation is good and the repartee between her and Cary Grant fun.
184,his_girl_friday,critics,fresh,p,"This farcical film is smartly acted, dialoged, and directed. It has nary a ""Go"" light for boredom."
185,his_girl_friday,critics,fresh,p,"The picture is a blessed relief from most of the solemn and oppressively sad stories that have been occupying New York screens since before the holidays, and it moves Rosalind Russell to the very top of the roster of Hollywood's cleverest comediennes."
186,his_girl_friday,critics,fresh,p,"It's Rosalind Russell's picture, of that there can be no doubt. She's In practically every scene and keeps the excitement moving like a house afire."
187,his_girl_friday,critics,fresh,p,"Fast, funny and vastly entertaining, His Girl Friday is, if anything, brighter and breezier than The Front Page of which it is a brilliant remake."
188,his_girl_friday,critics,fresh,p,"[Russell] plays it with a fine comedienne's consummate touch, turning on the steam when the heat is on and sparking the mounting crescendo of excitement with a performance that stays at the boiling point every inch of the way."
189,his_girl_friday,critics,fresh,p,"His Girl Friday owes most of its appeal to the snappy performances of Cary Grant as the brassy, unscrupulous managing editor and Miss Russell as the girl reporter."
190,his_girl_friday,critics,fresh,p,Wisecracks and jibes march across the screen in double time in the film His Girl Friday as a woman reporter and an editor engage in a sort of romantic blitzkreig.
191,his_girl_friday,critics,fresh,p,"Boisterous entertainment, ably handled by the principals who are backed up by Ralph Bellamy, Gene Lockhart, John Qualen, Helen Mack, and others."
192,his_girl_friday,critics,fresh,p,Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant rush through the picture in the highest spirits and from appearance the entire cast must have had a gay time on the set.
193,his_girl_friday,critics,fresh,p,"The sparkle comes from the fast dialog, the pace and excitement and the constant trickery in all quarters."
194,his_girl_friday,critics,fresh,p,"Grant's role as the slick, conniving managing editor is ideal for him."
195,his_girl_friday,critics,fresh,p,The smartest and most sophisticated piece of entertainment in a week that is notable for its high entertainment average.
196,his_girl_friday,critics,fresh,p,"It is no fare for the sentimentalist, romance seeker or sober problem play fan, but for those who want fast, hilarious and brittle farce it is tops."
197,his_girl_friday,critics,fresh,p,Miss Russell gives a top-notch portrayal as Hildy. She has the natural enthusiasm and spirit for the job and undoubtedly will score hits with audiences.
198,his_girl_friday,critics,fresh,p,The picture is really a howl and should find favor with every member of the family.
199,his_girl_friday,critics,fresh,p,"[His Girl Friday] is one of the raciest, slickest comedies in months. It gets away to a flying start and gains rather than loses momentum as it speeds to Its climax."
200,his_girl_friday,audience,5.0,p,Amazing dialogue. Witty.  Phenomenal cast. Outstanding performances.  Original and fun ever time you watch it.  A top 5 of all time. ❤️❤️❤️
201,his_girl_friday,audience,5.0,p,classic by every measure! one of the all time enjoyable films
202,his_girl_friday,audience,4.0,p,"A classic ‘screwball' comedy, or in simpler terms, a quirky comedy. Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell both bring their A game here with brilliant chemistry throughout.

The comedic elements come from a pretty good script from Charles Lederer but it's the performances from both leads that ignite the film. 

The narrative shifts back and forward and the tone is interesting as the film progresses. It's a good film at a satisfactory length too. 

One of Grants best. Definitely recommend."
203,his_girl_friday,audience,3.0,p,"Grant and Russell invest in their roles and provide a few brilliant moments, but this romantic comedy coasts on charms and fast dialogue to cover up the uninteresting conflict not pertaining to the main character's relationships. It seems that the filmmakers and actors sought to show off more than anything else in order to deliver speed rather than thoughtfulness. Grant's character is a charming scumbag and much of the film seems antiquated and aged rather than timeless. The screenplay weakens in the second half as it focuses on tying up the plot rather than offering the amusing quips in high volume earlier on. His Girl Friday is a decent time-killer, but not one that modern audiences are particularly missing out on."
204,his_girl_friday,audience,4.0,p,"Packed full of incredibly fast-paced dialogue, characters constantly speaking over one another, and an incredibly charming performance from Grant, His Girl Friday is probably one of the greatest romantic comedy classics that isn't really part of pop culture mainstream these days. There is always something happening, though Hawks dedicates a surprising amount of time towards darker moments that haven't seeped into the film's reputation - criticisms of the police and judicial systems, and particularly the press and yellow journalism (a woman literally attempts suicide due to the mischaracterizations of a group of backroom wordsmiths, and it stops the film dead with sobriety for a moment). The plot is convoluted, but that's part of the point - that Grant's Walter would go to such bizarre lengths to create the opportunity to preserve his relationship with Hildy (Russell), as faking phone calls gradually escalates to harboring a convicted killer. The fast-paced dialogue and consistent one-liners and brisk jokes often make this film seem like a slightly more fleshed out, romantic version of a Marx Brothers film, though championed by a magnetic performance from a single actor rather than a trio. Funny, short, and distinctive, His Girl Friday is still an absolute must see for both fans of classic film and those just looking for some entertainment value. (4/5)"
205,his_girl_friday,audience,3.0,p,The cycle of abuse in black and white still hold up today. This movie does a great job painting manipulation as romantic. The news paper guy moves about in an amusing manor tho so that was a laugh. Good dialogue. Very Gilmore girls.
206,his_girl_friday,audience,3.5,p,"i'll say it, rosalind russell is a dime & cary grant does his best to keep up in this fast-talking adventure"
207,his_girl_friday,audience,5.0,p,One of the finest works of Cary Grant and Rosalind Russel.
208,his_girl_friday,audience,5.0,p,Dialogue is just insane.  They deliver so much information in such a short time and you don't even realize they are doing it.  Movies just moved faster back then and it shows here.
209,his_girl_friday,audience,3.5,p,"Watched once and found movie to be both very enjoyable and easy watching. Grant and Russel play high-anxiety ridden/believable news reporters. The dialogue speed is fast, but easy to follow as it is suspenseful. Scenery is mostly office, after hours card playing,
And several outside night scenes.
Suspenseful, comedy, and dramatic at times. Must watch"
0,sister_act,critics,fresh,p,"Whoopi is aware of the goofy premise, refusing to take her situation with any seriousness, even though the rest of the cast attempts a level of sincerity."
1,sister_act,critics,fresh,p,"Sister Act is outrageous fun and delicious deviltry. The laughs keep coming but, best of all, there's much humanity at work. It's a movie that just, pardon me, makes you feel darn good."
2,sister_act,critics,fresh,p,"It's all pretty predictable, and if there was time you might get pissed off at the ridiculousness of it all. But things move at such a quickened pace, and the comedic timing of all involved is impressive enough to override the structural flaws."
3,sister_act,critics,rotten,n,"The film trundles along, full of holy-poky, mayhem and one-liners."
4,sister_act,critics,fresh,p,The musical numbers really make Sister Act.
5,sister_act,critics,fresh,p,"Light and fluffy as it is, ""Sister Act"" still has plenty of laugh-out-loud moments and some warm fuzzies as well as some believable action, and that makes it a 7 out of 10 in my book. But the sequel? It's more like a 5."
6,sister_act,critics,rotten,n,Nothing like a heartwarming Disney comedy with a body count to raise spirits.
7,sister_act,critics,fresh,p,
8,sister_act,critics,fresh,p,"A silly, harmless star vehicle for Whoopi Goldberg--sort of nuns on the run."

20,sister_act,audience,4.0,p,"In this Touchstone release, Whoopi Goldberg stars as a Reno lounge singer that witnesses a murder and is put into protective custody inside a San Fransisco convent.  Whoopi kills it as ""Sister Mary Clarence'' and really brands this movie with her style of comedy. The movie does start a bit slow, but picks up once Mary Clarence joins the choir. This is one of the first soundtracks I bought after this movie came out and I feel that the music is the biggest highlight of the film. I love Sister Mary Patrick, played by Kathy Najimy, and I had a huge crush on Sister Mary Robert played by Wendy Makkena. Then I found out her singing voice wasn't her but Andrea Robinson and my crush was crushed. Her voice still gives me chills during the movie though! One of my favorites, highly recommended!"
21,sister_act,audience,5.0,p,"One of the feel-good, nostalgic movies from my younger days that made its way into my heart forever. The entire cast is perfect. Whoopi Goldberg makes the her character Deloris believable and you can't help but root for her. She's truly hilarious and unique. Maggie Smith is marvelous as the Mother Superior and the other supporting players (that include Kathy Najimy & Mary Wickes) are a treat. The script is hilarious and keeps things interesting even when it occasionally slides into somewhat familiar territory. The musical numbers are phenomenal, ranging from adorable to immensely touching before the movie ends. Sister Act will always remain as one of my favorites...movies really don't get much better than this when it comes to the more lighthearted ones."
22,sister_act,audience,4.5,p,Only Whoopi Goldberg could pull off this scam!!!!
23,sister_act,audience,3.5,p,Having fun & enjoy with family is the best description for the act.
24,sister_act,audience,4.0,p,A Classic. I liked it.
25,sister_act,audience,3.5,p,"The premise is silly and the dialogue predictable--Whoopi remarking the habit makes her look like a penguin.  Really? The tough neighborhood kids are suddenly  back in church thanks to reworking a couple of traditional hymns into 60s style girl group music. If only we'd known we could've saved millions on social programs.  But forgive it these sins because they provide the framework for some fun and some truly thrilling musical numbers that will make you wish you were back in 6th grade choir so you could convince the choir mistress to let you go with that rocking version of ""Hail, Holy Queen.""  Whoopi and Dame Maggie Smith bring their usual magic to the screen. Combined with the music and some great one liners, it's a movie you'll watch many times."
26,sister_act,audience,5.0,p,"One of my favorite feel good movies. Amazing music, funny lines, classic 90's style."
27,sister_act,audience,5.0,p,The best movie with Whoopi Goldberg & Maggie Smith!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
28,sister_act,audience,4.0,p,An irresistible farce of habit.

30,good_morning_vietnam,critics,fresh,p,"Robin Williams has a role practically tailor made for his irreverent, yet uniquely sensitive personality."
31,good_morning_vietnam,critics,fresh,p,"Robin Williams was finally given a showcase for his extraordinary improvisational skills in this, the first comedy set in Vietnam."
32,good_morning_vietnam,critics,fresh,p,The film is distinctive for being Hollywood's first Vietnam comedy and among the first movies to treat the Vietnamese themselves as real people.
33,good_morning_vietnam,critics,fresh,p,Tailor-made for Williams' manic improvisational mugging qualities.
34,good_morning_vietnam,critics,fresh,p,"The film is all Williams; he has a field day with this character and this country and this period in history, with all its horror -- and comedy."
35,good_morning_vietnam,critics,fresh,p,"Good Morning, Vietnam proved that Robin Williams could act and be hilariously funny in the same film."
36,good_morning_vietnam,critics,fresh,p,Robin Williams at his scatalogical finest.
37,good_morning_vietnam,critics,fresh,p,"From the start, the film bowls you over with excitement and for those who can latch on, it's a nonstop ride."
38,good_morning_vietnam,critics,fresh,p,"Levinson serio-comedy about Vietnam is first and foremost a star vehicle for comedian Robin Williams, who gives a manic, highly-charged performance as the real-life dj Adrian Cronauer in the early years of the War."
39,good_morning_vietnam,critics,fresh,p,
40,good_morning_vietnam,critics,fresh,p,A perfect showcase for Robin Williams.

49,good_morning_vietnam,critics,fresh,p,
50,good_morning_vietnam,audience,4.5,p,"Arguably the best performance from Robin Williams, ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" serves as an over-the-top maniac comedy that has a surprisingly moving story. The present action is usually more shocking and unexpected when compared to other war movies, though it is done very well. The comedy is top-notch and is sure to get quite a few laughs thanks to the stellar performance of its star Robin Williams."
51,good_morning_vietnam,audience,1.0,n,"This movie is based on the true story of an US Air Force man transferred from Crete to Vietnam in 1965 to be the new DJ of the US Army radio station, and when he goes on the air for the first time, he refuses to follow the dull format of the previous DJ or play the dull music that had been played. In the movie, the new DJ is in fact encouraged by his fellow enlisted soldiers to play contemporary pop music from Motown and The Beach Boys and engage in rapid-fire comedy patter. Various military people all laugh at the new DJ's verbal antics, but as might be expected, the military higher-ups are not pleased with the new DJ's irreverent program.

A good potential idea, but poorly utilized. Robin Williams' routine was reportedly ad-libbed, but his comedy routine failed to be funny. The soldiers are all shown laughing, but one gets the idea that they do so because that is what they were hired to do. Rapid-fire comedy and silly verbal antics can be hilarious, but Williams was simply dull and boring, as if he wasn't sure exactly what he was supposed to do. I didn't bother to finish the film; what I saw of it shouted that it was going to be standard and clichéd, and what good is it to watch a comedian who is not funny?

I wonder what the real-life DJ was like. He certainly must have been funnier."
52,good_morning_vietnam,audience,3.0,p,"A mediocre movie by the late Robin Williams, okay for its worth!"
53,good_morning_vietnam,audience,3.0,p,"Williams' radio host bits are a bit much and make it feel like about 30 mins of the movie is one of his stand up sets. Starting to see him broaden his range, though, which will portend some great stuff to come."
54,good_morning_vietnam,audience,2.5,n,"Much of the humor in this film hasn't aged very well (a lot of it is referential, and the 'style' of humor didn't really connect with me), but it's still worth watching for being one of the only Vietnam war movies that doesn't just give a token shot at humanizing the Vietnamese but actually spends some time on it. That, and of course the amazing performance by Robin Williams."
55,good_morning_vietnam,audience,2.0,n,"gosh; i love Robin Williams, i really do, but this movie was chaotic. why does this have such good reviews & why the hell is it 2 hours long?! i'll be honest, it took me 2 days to get to the 45 min mark which is when i had to just turn it off. i couldn't take it. he was spitting jokes one after the other; rapid fire -- it was like he was always short of breath or couldn't breathe at all. was not a pleasant watch for me."
56,good_morning_vietnam,audience,3.0,p,"Good, if a little underwhelming.

Robin Williams (Adrian) is in strong form, while it's amusing to see a less experienced Forest Whitaker (Edward) in a rather dorky role. 'Good Morning, Vietnam' all makes for satisfactory viewing thanks to Mr. Williams' humour, even if I didn't have a great deal of interest in the plot et al."
57,good_morning_vietnam,audience,3.5,p,"Propelled by Robin Williams' fantastic performance, this comedy which takes place during the Vietnam war is great entertainment."
58,good_morning_vietnam,audience,3.5,p,"Not bad, a decent watch if you have a few hours to kill."
59,good_morning_vietnam,audience,4.0,p,"Don't get me wrong. I like ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" and I will always like Robin Williams. But this isn't his best movie. It's Williams doing his thing. It's stream-of-consciousness comedy with a dark backdrop of the Vietnam Conflict.
It's not always hilarious -- as Robert Wuhl's character would repeatedly suggest -- but it is vintage Robin Williams. And because of that, it is good."
60,pride_2014,critics,fresh,p,"Uproariously funny, with the ensemble bouncing off each other like an all-Welsh ping-pong match. But for every moment of humour there is a moment of poignancy, depicting two contrasting communities who are both desperate for help and support."
61,pride_2014,critics,fresh,p,Pride is as heart-warming as it is a rousing call for radical resistance and solidarity between oppressed groups.

84,pride_2014,audience,5.0,p,"This is a fantastic film and a true story too. A very inspirational tale that happened in 1984 when a group of gay campaigners decided to fight for the miners. The films shows how the group was faced with prejudice but as time went on things began to change . The final scene is tearjerking as the miners turn up for pride, There are some gaffs in the film such as PVC Doors and windows that were not around in 1984 in the welsh valleys neither were black weely bins! But a wonderful story, sad that Mark Ashton died in 1987, but what an inspirational young man."

110,heathers,audience,5.0,p,"I liked Heathers because its dark humor made it a bit easier to be aware of what issues people face because of stereotypes put on them by society. Some stereotypes were falsely placed on some characters and the movie would play on this by showing how society treats them. The circumstances placed on the characters were completely different to what they were going through. Then once those characters were gone society would change their thoughts on the characters which highlights society's hypocrisy. Each death could be triggering for people today, however I think people my age could watch to reflect on how others are pushed to certain situations."
111,heathers,audience,5.0,p,My god Heathers is absolutely a brilliant smart teen dark comedy film with really great cast and brilliant writing and great director/filmmaking of the 80's era.
112,heathers,audience,4.0,p,"The 1988 film, Heathers directed by Micheal Lehmann is a horror-comedy that follows the intense lives and ""friendships"" of the top four most popular high school girls. When the new ""bad-boy"" student, JD arrives at Westerburg High things quickly become grim and murderous. With Winona Ryder starring as Veronica and Christian Slader as JD, they cause chaos and reek havoc onto their fellow student body. As people begin to drop like files, Veronica is forced to take her own stance aganist the treacherous JD. 

While there were so many things out of the ordinary with the Heather trio, one thing audiences will notice is the prominence of the color red. In this film, the vibrant red was a symbol of power. The first Heather, Heather Chandler played by Kim Walker is seen strictly in red for her on-screen time. Once she is eliminated by Veronica and JD the powerful red shifts to the once green Heather, Heather Duke. Duke's rise to power starts off slowly as she begins to use Chandler's old red scrunchi. Once Duke wears the scrunchi, Veronica knows that the power will continue to grow. As a result, Duke's entire wardrobe begins to consume the color red. 

Lehmann's Heathers is not for the weak minds or stomachs. While I have enjoyed this film for many years and consider it a favorite of mine I cannot say that an unsuspecting audience would agree. Its dark and cynical humor is simply not for everyone. I think that if you discover this film on your own time you would most likely enjoy it. I would not recommend this for a younger audience; The film's mockery of suicide attempts and raunchy humor is not fitting for the young viewers and could get lost in translation. If that is not the demographic watching Heathers is a great film for more mature audiences."
113,heathers,audience,3.5,p,The plot has it's holes but the movie on itself delivers solid comedy and social commentary.
114,heathers,audience,5.0,p,"Heathers is a gripping piece of work that manages to be funny and shocking while also being thematically poignant. It certainly isn't for everyone, as it's brutal violence is certain to turn some people off, but I absolutely get why this is considered a definitive cult classic."
115,heathers,audience,4.0,p,"Veronica (Winona Ryder) belongs to a small clique of spoiled, narcissistic high school girls.  When she falls for J.D. (Christian Slater), the rebellious new boy in town, he tells her what she has long suspected – her life would be better without her friends and the jocks who worship them.  Heathers is a pitch-black comedy about murder disguised as suicide, a corrosively funny examination of the destruction of student hierarchy.  Other than an ending that comes across as excessive, it's a film that will have you cheering for all of the wrong reasons.  Slater and Ryder are great in the leading roles, the dialogue is fantastic (""I do not patronize bunny rabbits!!""), and the whole thing has an appropriately ethereal and dream-like quality."
116,heathers,audience,5.0,p,"An iconic subversion on the John Hughes films of the era, the film is consistently funny, hilariously well written, and filled with sharp performances while managing to feel simultaneously timeless and retro."
117,heathers,audience,4.0,p,"This is among the most memorable teen movies I've ever seen, that's for sure. I wasn't a big fan of the ending, but the entire leadup to it was excellent and had some of the best dialogue I've heard in a movie with a high school setting. The odd prescience, the quality of the acting and the film score were all surprising and effective. I would've happily watched a lengthier version or a sequel!"
118,heathers,audience,3.0,p,I know it is a cult movie but it isn't what it is made out to be.  It is watchable but not great.
119,heathers,audience,3.0,p,"It was a pretty good movie up until the end. Maybe I just don't understand Veronica's emotional attachment to JD, but I would have shot him dead right when I saw him after hearing his plan, not wasted time asking him to put the bomb down or put his hands on his head. Use the full magazine for good measure."

140,1000253-adams_rib,audience,3.5,p,"""First of all, I should like to say at the outset that I think that the arguments advanced by the consel for the defense were sound. Mere sound.""

Any film that bases itself on gender roles is going to age a bit with time, as the social politics will naturally evolve to the point where the dynamics aren't exactly up to date; when you're going through jury selection and potential jurors unironically and confidently express that they are against equalt treatment of the sexes, it gives the viewers a bit of a pause as to just how much different the world of George Cukor is from that of today. What themes today seem obvious were likely considered preachy, overzealous, and an attack on American values by many audience members in 1949 (and if they weren't outraged by Katherine Hepburn extolling the need for gender equality, the presence of a black man on the jury probably sent them over the edge). Despite Cukor's esteem there is a noticeable bit of irregularity in the directing, with a small handful of the longer, dialogue-heavy scenes allowing a couple of flubs in line delivery. While you could nitpick parts of gender role treatment of the film until the cows come home, it's easier to appreciate a solid romcom with good chemistry between its leads and a well-constructed sense of comedy and social progressivism. 

Where do you even find a licorice gun? (3.5/5)"
141,1000253-adams_rib,audience,3.5,p,Classic comedy with great acting and directing
142,1000253-adams_rib,audience,3.5,p,"George Cukor's Adam's Rib is a lighthearted, sophisticated comedy with a serious underlying theme.  The famous chemistry between Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn fills up the screen, and the supporting cast members are wonderful, colorful and very effective."
143,1000253-adams_rib,audience,3.5,p,"A light hearted and entertaining romp between two married lawyers. Again Katharine Hepburn is at her consistent best. Katharine Hepburn is beautiful, intelligent and the classiest actress ever!"

145,1000253-adams_rib,audience,3.5,p,"*only viewed once*

Rom-com involving two lawyers that are assigned to the same case; prosecuting and criminal defense.

Writing, directing, editing are all well done. Easy to watch and much comedic moments; I'd guess 10-20 good laughs. Length of movie is perfect. Katharine plays a semi-strong, witty feminist, while Spencer plays the angry sexist. There is no violence between the couple, which I can appreciate. 

Scenery was quite engaging between lawyer offices, accounting office, apartments, fancy dinner party, court rooms, and a countryside home.

Hepburn describes this double standard well in court, with its clear relevance to society in general.  This kind of tom-foolery would never be allowed in a real courtroom, but the movie gets kudos for its message.  It is one of the first ""message"" movies that try to move civilization forward.

The highlight is obviously the opening scene with the stoners, arguably one of the greatest cold-opening/mood-setting scenes in the history of cinema, but the later scenes are also very funny and are only a slight step down from the intro. They do give Farva's jokes a little too much of the running time when the intent is to draw a laugh for how unfunny he is  and some of the scenes are a lot better than others, causing a slightly uneven overall experience, but the best part to me is how natural the scenes seem to flow - I never felt like they had included a scene to fit in a joke they'd thought of and rather felt like they'd written the screenplay out and then inserted the jokes organically afterwards. There are other comedies from 2001 that are very slightly superior, but this is still a classic and endlessly rewatchable."

204,office_space,audience,4.5,p,"On the surface, Office Space appears to be a crude movie about how much work sucks, like a Studio Movie equivalent to Clerks, just in a Corporate setting rather than a store.  However, when looked at more deeply, this is almost a Call-To-Arms for the often neglected or poorly-treated workers, making this one of the two most subversively politically powerful films of the 90's (the other, in my opinion, being the South Park movie, which was literally an open declaration of war against bad parenting).  Now, many who watch this movie think that it's just a light-hearted affair, and if we're being honest, that's because the movie's overwhelmingly light-hearted tone does make it such a breezy film-viewing experience that most would not even notice.  But there is a message and it's one that is inherently a powerful one, and in many ways, this breezy tone fused with some crude verbal (always verbal) jokes, actually helps to keep one entertained more than riled up.  There's none of the ultra-lowbrow humor like farts or what not, and the characters are each written differently, and written well (as well as acted well).  The story has more than enough to keep it moving but luckily keeps things rather straightforward and easy to follow, and actually manages to keep a consistent comedic tone without getting bogged down during the dramatic moments, or ever trying to amp things up too far.  Oh, and it's infinitely quotable.  If there's any shortcoming, it's that it's not really a laugh-at-the-time movie - I recall watching it with my family in 1999 and us only laughing here and there, but during our conversation later, realizing how good the movie was; similarly, in 2001 my college suite-mates got together and watched it, and nobody laughed a single time, but when the movie ended, they all looked at each other, smiling, nodding in approval, saying things like: ""..Awesome movie!""  In a sense, it's almost like a Slow-Burn movie, just in a Comedy sense, rather than a Horror, and the fact that it has a surprisingly potent undercurrent of messaging just makes it all the more wonderful."
205,office_space,audience,4.0,p,"Summary: Peter's desk job sucks the life out of him M-F (and even on Saturdays when his god-awful manager expects him to pull overtime). After therapy brings a grand realization that work stress doesn't really matter, Peter stops giving a crap. When the company downsizes, him and his colleagues plot their revenge.

Takeaways: Quotable dry humor and hilariously quirky characters make this movie timeless. Worth a watch (or rewatch!)."

207,office_space,audience,5.0,p,"Classic film. I relate to the main character. But, I also had a manager who was dying of cancer and still came into our office job because she loved to work so much. I can't relate to that mentality, but, these people do exist.

I met an open mic comic who had a bit about how he sold all his dreams, and I thought it was great, but everyone around me was TERRIBLE! The MC, though I'd never head him groan about any of the other mental cases rambling on about boxed cake mixes and needing bathroom sex RIGHT NOW, this MC seemed particularly unhappy with ""I sold my dreams"" Tiny Nerd Tim--who, none of us could ever remember his name, so we'd just call him Tim, and he'd ""That's not my name"" and you'd ""Tim old pal old friend!"".

No one liked Tim, get it? So terrible he wasn't even mildly entertaining terrible to watch. But, I really thought Tim was funny. I was incredulous no one liked him. I made sure to intimidate Tim and get in his face about it, ""Tim, that was so sad and wonderful and I loved it even though everyone hated it"" and he'd ""That's not my name"" and I'd ""You wanna play my show, Tim?"".

Tim-Not-His-Name played my show and I even introduced him with the wrong name. Tim got up there, reintroduced himself, and everyone thought he was the funniest. My friend who'd seen Terrible Tim was shocked, ""Tim...is funny?"". 

Tim-Not-His-Name had a critique for me after I did my bit which was, ""I like my office job, even though you consider it hell on earth"" which is why Tim is now getting the last laugh in his seven-figure-per-year salary-tech-gig, and me who can't remember his real name? Not so much."

20,mash,audience,1.0,n,"Cruder, more meanspirited, and much more misogynistic than the far superior T.V. show it inspired, the M*A*S*H movie seems like it wants to justify its dark, often cruel humor by framing it as the reaction of men to the incredible violence and suffering that they are exposed to on a daily basis, but the equation of depiction between cruel experience and cruel reaction is heavily weighted in favor of the reaction, making the film feel more nihilistic than cynical, more misanthropic than righteously angry. The genius of the show was its balanced juxtaposition between gore-splattered surgery and what life might be like for a civilian ripped from their home and thrust into the brutal, convoluted, often infuriatingly incompetent world of the army. In the film, we spend all of ten minutes in the operating room where the emotional trauma of war, like the blood of their patients, rolls right off the doctors and nurses with little fanfare, reaction, or even direct addressment, thus sacrificing the potentially complicating context of the setting so more room could be made for juvenile pranks and vicious sexism."
21,mash,audience,4.0,p,an unrelenting stream of chaos that never fails to entertain.
22,mash,audience,4.5,p,Director Altman near him peak. Blobbo saw in show when came out.  Much enjoy.  But was young. Maybe dated now.  (Was 50 years ago.) When see again will reevaluate.
23,mash,audience,4.0,p,"The 1970s are considered Hollywood's golden age. Martin Scorsese's incomparable career really took off with Taxi Driver, the most popular films of all time entered our lives with the first  two parts of The Godfather and the Rocky franchise entered the boxing ring for the first time. But the first great classic of this decade was Robert Altman's M*A*S*H. A mix of comedy and war film, in which surgeons try to bridge the harsh reality of the Korean War with a lot of humour and political incorrectness.

In wars, it is important to show solidarity. That is why this is not a film with a definitive protagonist or antagonist. The entire cast rounds out an outstanding ensemble performance. The closest to a leading role is Donald Sutherland as Hawkeye Pierce. Several plot lines lead through him, such as the numerous pranks that the surgeons within the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (hence M*A*S*H) play on each other. It is his ideas that often lead to disputes in the camp and he is not too shy for a quip, even if they are exclusively below the belt. Hawkeye stands symbolically for a surgeon who has already seen too much and therefore can no longer muster up any compassion or the like. Especially towards his colleagues. Unless they are on a similar track to him, such as Elliot Gould's character Captain John Francis Xavier McIntyre. He and Sutherland have a chemistry that makes for a laugh out loud in pretty much every scene. At least with their male colleagues, because their statements and jokes are mostly directed at Major Margaret Houlihan, also known as ""Hot Lips"". She is embodied by Sally Kellerman and this in an extremely eccentric way. One can completely understand the suffering of her character, for what is more difficult than asserting oneself in a war zone full of sexist men. She gets her nickname after an incident with Robert Duvall's character Major Frank Burns. He is only seen briefly, but he certainly has a lot of impact on the plot of the film.

It is no coincidence that M*A*S*H became a popular comedy series a few years later. Altman has managed to turn a film with the serious subject of war into a pure laugh-fest. Every scene is filled with self-deprecating, politically incorrect or simply tasteless jokes. From today's perspective, it is impossible to imagine a film like this would still work. Gender roles are clearly distributed and many sayings that would be unacceptable today are expressed in M*A*S*H without any hesitation. You can like that or not, but ultimately you have to try to put yourself back in the time. Measured against this, the film is unique, especially in terms of its screenplay. The common thread of gallows humour runs through consistently and almost no attention is paid to how the war situation might emotionally burden the soldiers. All this is overshadowed by the constant schmaltz, which is even present during the camp callers sketchy announcements. M*A*S*H is a true feel-good adventure with a revolutionary dark comedy aspect."

26,mash,audience,4.0,p,"All of Robert Altman's auteur directorial stylings are to be found in MASH, an early offering from the master.  Donald Sutherland, Elliott Gould, and Tom Skerritt play medical doctors at a mobile army hospital in South Korea, where the horrors of the work are offset by chasing nurses, drinking martinis, and partaking in hijinks.  Mixed with the blood and sinew and death, there is plenty of dark humor and some great performances from Altman's ensemble cast.  Despite the fact that the football game at the end, despite being wildly entertaining, feels out place, the film is a brilliant snapshot of how one uses humor to deal with the unrelenting horrors of war."

Hot Fuzz (2007) initially starts off as an entertaining comedy from Edgar Wright, but once it gets into the flow of things it is a fantastic watch. On top of the highly amusing comedy and character chemistry, there is an intriguing story and mystery in the centre which differs from most similar movies.

Just like in previous work, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost's chemistry is unmatched and provides a steady foundation for everything else to build off of. Hot Fuzz (2007) offers much more than meets the eye, as mentioned there is a great mystery within it as well as hilarious moments, however you also get action which is very reminiscent of older action movies.

The entire movie feels very studio - I can smell the suits nodding enthusiastically at how it checks all of the boxes on their list - but it's well executed enough to be worth the time."
119,game_night_2018,audience,3.5,p,"It's more fun than it is funny, but there's some laughs too. It does that thing all comedies seem to do now where the final act gets more serious as they wrap up whatever plot they've created. But it never gets too serious and doesn't overstay. It's a solid, fun watch."
120,spy_2015,critics,fresh,p,Melissa McCarthy shows off her superb comic timing in this frothy action comedy.
121,spy_2015,critics,fresh,p,Spy is a smart and uplifting film - one that's finally worthy of Melissa McCarthy's comedic genius.
122,spy_2015,critics,fresh,p,Melissa McCarthy and crew brandish a polished comedic expertise to poke fun at every major facet of the spy subgenre.
123,spy_2015,critics,fresh,p,I can say with some certainty that a good comedy is hard to find. I can confirm this is one of them.
124,spy_2015,critics,fresh,p,There's something absolutely irresistible about Melissa McCarthy. It's a beautiful thing to behold when she gifts us with a film worthy of her talent.
125,spy_2015,critics,rotten,n,Does it occur to Feig-or anyone involved in the making of Spy-that not everyone dotes on the forces of law and order nor finds their operations as endlessly fascinating as he apparently does?
126,spy_2015,critics,fresh,p,'Spy' is a hilarious comedy that knows how to make fun of James Bond movies without falling into the dangerous routine of using gags as its only narrative engine. [Full Review in Spanish]
127,spy_2015,critics,fresh,p,It was hilarious... and it had pretty good action.
128,spy_2015,critics,fresh,p,"It was exactly what I wanted. It was fun, it was stupid, it was entertaining."
129,spy_2015,critics,fresh,p,"I hope one of these days someone will write a Groundhog Day-level script for McCarthy, and she'll finally get to create the classic her talent promises. But until then, Spy is a pretty agreeable time at the theater."
130,spy_2015,critics,fresh,p,"A balls-to-the-wall, mile-a-minute laugh fest that plays as if custom made for the comedic talents of its stars."
131,spy_2015,critics,fresh,p,It's the secret agent action movie flipped on its head. Mr. Perfect Agent has a secret weapon in his ear: Melissa McCarthy.
132,spy_2015,critics,fresh,p,"Had it not been for one painfully tone deaf, unfunny, offensive running gag, Spy would have been damn good and not simply good."
133,spy_2015,critics,fresh,p,"Spy is funny, violent and exciting."
134,spy_2015,critics,fresh,p,"While Feig doesn't reach same level of quality he did with Bridesmaids, he gives McCarthy's talent the platform it's deserved for a long time, and she makes the most of it."
135,spy_2015,critics,fresh,p,We finally have an action-adventure comedy that is truly funny and truly feminist.
136,spy_2015,critics,fresh,p,"Fieg and McCarthy have already had success with ""Bridesmaids"" and ""The Heat,"" but this may be the best of the bunch -- a whip-smart send-up of the James Bond genre, that is also very, very funny."
137,spy_2015,critics,fresh,p,"Spy is fun, funny and friendly while simultaneously being true to the genre that provides its title."
138,spy_2015,critics,fresh,p,"When the film gets weighed down with exposition,n there's enough humor and quirky character moments to keep the laughs coming."
139,spy_2015,critics,fresh,p,"The movie is 15 minutes too long; but as far as laughs go, it's a winner."
140,spy_2015,audience,3.5,p,"The movie surprised me with how light and comical it felt, but dark and serious at the same time. Some good jokes and I laughed out loud a few times"
141,spy_2015,audience,4.5,p,This is the best example of how to make a comedy with  great story.
142,spy_2015,audience,5.0,p,Spy shows that the Feig McCarthy partnership is pure gold. The action scenes are tense and logical and McCarthy's comedic genius shines through.
143,spy_2015,audience,5.0,p,Absolutely brilliant!!!
144,spy_2015,audience,3.5,p,Surprisingly great movie.
145,spy_2015,audience,5.0,p,One of my comfort movies.
146,spy_2015,audience,0.5,n,i hate melissa mccarthy
147,spy_2015,audience,5.0,p,"So fun, McCarthy is brilliant as usual, and completely makes this film.  But the whole cast is top notch.  Full of great lines, action, and comedy, this movie is a rarity."
148,spy_2015,audience,4.5,p,Funny stuff. Melissa McCarthy is awesome.
149,spy_2015,audience,4.0,p,"Yes, yes, and yes. Melissa McCarthy's best work."
150,trading_places,critics,fresh,p,Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd are quite the duo in this funny Christmas film with some strong themes under its hood. [Full review in Spanish]
151,trading_places,critics,fresh,p,"Trading Places, in this of all Hollywood years, is a joy to behold -- clever without being smart, affectionate without being sentimental, They can make movies like they used to after all."
152,trading_places,critics,fresh,p,"Since 48 hrs. had yet to be released, Landis and the studio took a big risk casting Murphy, fortunately, the gamble (pun intended) paid off."
153,trading_places,critics,fresh,p,"The two stars (especially Murphy) are terrific, and the supporting cast provides additional flavor."
154,trading_places,critics,fresh,p,...Trading Places is still funny with thanks to Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy but some of the film's racial aspects are problematic in this era.
155,trading_places,critics,fresh,p,Juxtaposing iconic architecture and historic statues with this heavily loaded satire examining the intersection of race and class situate Trading Places firmly in its American context.
156,trading_places,critics,fresh,p,"Trading Places is an excellent comedy -- a bit cold and cerebral, but well-constructed and organized. [Full Review in Spanish]"
157,trading_places,critics,fresh,p,"What really resonates about this comedy, some 30 years after its release, is how it was able to intuitively crystallise the whole socio-political landscape of the era."
158,trading_places,critics,fresh,p,"Landis' direction is deft, but the sparkling performances are the real draw not only by Murphy and Aykroyd but also by Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy as the meddling oldsters, Denholm Elliott as the gentlemanly servant and Jamie Lee Curtis."
159,trading_places,critics,rotten,n,Trading Places is a comedy of unavoidable fits and starts.
160,trading_places,critics,fresh,p,"This blatant, unacknowledged reworking of The Prince and the Pauper is a rattling comedy showcase for the unique talents of Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd, who have seldom recaptured the form they show here."
161,trading_places,critics,fresh,p,"While the two-hour running time overstretches the material, there are plenty of laughs -- as well as sly digs at the racism and greed of the American establishment."
162,trading_places,critics,rotten,n,"Directed by John Landis with a surprising amount of class, though he lets some of his old Animal House' vulgarity slip ostentatiously into the action."
163,trading_places,critics,fresh,p,"It's all outrageously contrived, and only surprising restraint by director John Landis makes it work. The writing is superb, too, leaving the two funnymen free to do the most inspired textured portrayals either has managed in movies."
164,trading_places,critics,fresh,p,"Edgy, bawdy '80s comedy not meant for kids."
165,trading_places,critics,fresh,p,...a fun-filled film all the way around.
166,trading_places,critics,rotten,n,Preposterous lighthearted one-joke comedy.
167,trading_places,critics,fresh,p,...one of the most impressive comedies to emerge out of the 1980s.
168,trading_places,critics,fresh,p,Fast-paced and energetic social satire fleshed out with lots of enjoyable silliness.
169,trading_places,critics,fresh,p,The Saturday Night Live veterans Murphy and Ackroyd are the show-stealers here in this decent family comedy.
170,trading_places,audience,3.0,p,"It was odd seeing Aykroyd get more screentime than Eddie did, but I actually preferred it that way as I've never loved Eddie's style & my lower expectations for Aykroyd led to me really enjoying his performance. The jokes per minute rate was fairly low, especially if you don't count the ones that missed by a mile (e.g. most of the gorilla stuff). They cast Al Franken in a tiny role but didn't make use of his comic abilities & they didn't manage to make the financial parts of the plot funny enough to be compelling viewing material. The opening scene of Eddie begging & the near-end scene of the Duke brother being racist felt tacked on as clumsy character building. The score was good though, and the jokes that did land were great."
171,trading_places,audience,5.0,p,"Probably the perfect 80's comedy.  All the jokes still work, the plot is strong, the acting mostly holds up.  There are a couple scenes which fall flat today, but on the whole the movie is still a must-see."
172,trading_places,audience,4.5,p,A classic comedy that is my favorite Eddie Murphy film hands down.
173,trading_places,audience,5.0,p,One of my very favorite Christmas movies :)
174,trading_places,audience,5.0,p,"Great movie, have seen it multiple times, but is still very funny. Eddie Murphy is excellent and steals the show. One of Landis best films."
175,trading_places,audience,4.5,p,"It was a fun movie. Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy were great as the protagonists who had their lives swapped in a nature vs nurture bet by the main antagonists of the movie. You could feel sorry for Dan's character that lost everything (friends, family, fiancee, job, and finances) even if he was a jerk, and while you do feel a little disappointment that Eddie's character can no longer feel empathy for someone leading a life he used to live, but when he learns of the bet he tries to right it."
176,trading_places,audience,3.5,p,"An unusual mix - a comedy that has aged poorly on the surface level, but is still pretty darn relevant thematically, combining social movement, cultural racism, and American financial corruption into one package. The film may receive jeers for its use of blackface and racial coarseness, but that's because people only judge the film piecemeal; each of those moments adds up to a whole product that ridicules entrenched racial biases (Murphy breaking the fourth wall when a pair of old upper crust cheats attempt to childishly explain commodities). Its humor hasn't retained the quality it could have in places and part of the screwball formula is definitely dated, but it's still an entertaining film even if it has the wrong Belushi. At a moment in financial history like the Gamestop short event, Trading Places seems like an awfully fitting watch with its plot of an average Joe squeezing capital from Wall Street elites after they attempted market manipulation on an unwise position. Just the idea of old-school floor trading feels so prehistoric and impractical, it's practically as funny as any actual joke in the film. Even ignoring the film itself, Trading Places had a major effect on '80s and '90s pop culture in its establishment or reestablishment of major stars in Murphy, Aykroyd, and Curtis. (3.5/5)"
177,trading_places,audience,5.0,p,"Wonderful movie with great plot.  Murphy and Ackroyd show their genius.  With all of the long-awaited sequels from the 80s coming about, I formally request that Eddie and Dan look at doing a sequel.  I'd love to see their take on today's financial markets and where those characters would be today.  Holding off on a hostile takeover?  Landis is still around to direct!!"
178,trading_places,audience,4.5,p,very nice with a veiled social criticism
179,trading_places,audience,1.0,n,"A rehash of the old Rich vs. Poor that uses good joke formats with offensive and potentially hurtful content. Personally, I couldn't get past the first 20 min. The comedy was more than just ironic racism; it really did hurt and made me hate the movie. The use of the f slur echoed too (heads up). As of today, the comedy feels like it edges toward offensive jokes that have soured over time."
180,arsenic_and_old_lace,critics,rotten,n,"In its fast-paced, scatterbrained pandemonium, the varying characters and their intersecting stories rarely seem to fit together smoothly."
181,arsenic_and_old_lace,critics,rotten,n,Grows increasingly tiresome.
182,arsenic_and_old_lace,critics,rotten,n,"Today the stellar cast comes across as overacting, mugging into predictable pratfalls, blustering obtuseness and telegraphed laff lines."
183,arsenic_and_old_lace,critics,fresh,p,Cary Grant et al are on sparkling form in this classic darkly twisted comedy.
184,arsenic_and_old_lace,critics,fresh,p,"The film was adapted from a successful stage play and it comes across as very theatrical on screen, but once you get past that, there's an enjoyable lunacy to the whole thing."
185,arsenic_and_old_lace,critics,fresh,p,Cary Grant serial-killer comedy classic is cozy and tame.
186,arsenic_and_old_lace,critics,fresh,p,Riotously funny.
187,arsenic_and_old_lace,critics,fresh,p,"Despite the fact that picture runs 118 minutes, Frank Capra has expanded on the original play [by Joseph Kesselring] to a sufficient extent to maintain a steady, consistent pace."
188,arsenic_and_old_lace,critics,rotten,n,"The timing is abysmal throughout, turning fast pace into numbing frenzy."
189,arsenic_and_old_lace,critics,fresh,p,Good macabre fun.
190,arsenic_and_old_lace,critics,fresh,p,Dusty but gentle entertainment.
191,arsenic_and_old_lace,critics,fresh,p,"Unable to conceal the film's theatrical origins, Capra misfires as a director and misguides Cary Garnt, who's too mannered, but the time, the combo of horror and comedy was new and the old ladies' gruseome hobby was shocking to audiences."
192,arsenic_and_old_lace,critics,fresh,p,Charge! off to see this classic Capra screwballer.

199,arsenic_and_old_lace,critics,rotten,n,"Not one of Capra's best. Grant is too hammy and out of control, and without Boris Karloff as Jonathan Brewster, the joke is lost."
200,arsenic_and_old_lace,audience,4.5,p,One of my all time favorites.
201,arsenic_and_old_lace,audience,4.5,p,"Cary Grant basically plays Daffy Duck in a zany, absurd comedy with some serious content about murder and body disposal."
202,arsenic_and_old_lace,audience,5.0,p,"A wonderful film, but watching it now, this would make a great serious film. The one thing that spoils the film is Cary Grant, who is grating in the film, both acting-wise and voice wise, although in the right film he is great, in this one I feel he was badly cast"
203,arsenic_and_old_lace,audience,4.5,p,"What a great and funny movie while his grandmother and her friend are killing people off with poison tea, Teddy is down in the basement digging holes for the Panama Canal!!!!"
204,arsenic_and_old_lace,audience,5.0,p,"Zany. Madcap. Hilarious. Classic.
It's a delight to see the smooth, suave and sophisticated Cary Grant completely unhinged. He tumbles down a rabbit hole into a wacky un-reality that his dear aunts and uncle Teddy inhabit. It's an enjoyable farce, with a twist of spine-tingling menace from Raymond Massey. Peter Lorre is a hoot. All due to Frank Capra's direction."
205,arsenic_and_old_lace,audience,5.0,p,A brilliantly funny movie that is just as sharp and witty today as ever.
206,arsenic_and_old_lace,audience,5.0,p,"Blobbo laugh, resume love of life, cancel arsenic delivery."
207,arsenic_and_old_lace,audience,5.0,p,"Watched it when I was young, and it still is one of my favorite movies of all time. Entertaining, funny, crazy and filled with wonderful scenes."
208,arsenic_and_old_lace,audience,3.5,p,"Charming and decently funny if somewhat dated, ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" is one of those throwbacks from old Hollywood where they would take a Broadway show and then pretty much shoot the film as if it were on the stage. Grant is good, yet overplays the comedic role of the 'sane' Brewster. The rest of the cast, especially the two aunts (Hull and Adair reprising their Broadway performances) and the two brothers (Massey and Alexander) give great performance with dead-pan comic delivery. The cast is thoroughly rounded out by old familiar stars like Edward Everett Horton and a delightful turn by Peter Lorre. Well worth seeing at least once."
209,arsenic_and_old_lace,audience,5.0,p,"This is a must see movie for all lovers of film. It's laugh out loud hilarious! Cary Grant is in his comedic prime and at his very best in this movie. All of the actors in this film are wonderful, though, down to the cab driver. It's a perfect watch for Halloween. Curl up in your coziest blanket, get yourself a cup of hot chocolate and some popcorn and you'll have blast watching this wonderful film! Honestly, though, it's a great watch year round. The audience score is much more accurate as to what this should have been rated on this site. It just doesn't get much better than to have Cary Grant and Peter Lorre together in a comedy/suspense movie."
0,in_bruges,critics,rotten,n,"Why make such a film at this point in time? There's a good deal going on in the world, why this? Does anyone care about a pair of dreamed-up assassins?"
1,in_bruges,critics,fresh,p,"You get the sense, now and then, that McDonagh is taking a little too much relish in his character's political incorrectness, but the writing is so scabrously funny that you'll laugh despite your best intentions."
2,in_bruges,critics,fresh,p,One of the very best pictures of the year.
3,in_bruges,critics,fresh,p,'In Bruges' is a fantastic Boschian nightmare with profound themes to go along with its dark comedy.
4,in_bruges,critics,fresh,p,"For McDonagh to fashionably incorporate the brilliantly assembled cast with the beautiful city as an unexplored yet subverted adventure, cement In Bruges' cult-like status as an underrated gem of modern cinema."
5,in_bruges,critics,fresh,p,"Bittersweet, funny, heartfelt and beauteous."
6,in_bruges,critics,fresh,p,The writing is crisp and witty and full of interesting philosophical layers that gives the movie its surprising punch.
7,in_bruges,critics,fresh,p,One of the funniest films of this century.
8,in_bruges,critics,fresh,p,"McDonagh straddles that line between giving the movie just enough dramatic integrity, while also drawing attention to its postmodern machinations."
9,in_bruges,critics,fresh,p,Even the most obnoxious elements turn out to mean more than their self-consciously shocking surface.
10,in_bruges,critics,rotten,n,"In Bruges has some cracking lines in it, a cracking performance from Brendan Gleeson as Ken, and some very funny, provocative jokes, but I still don't know... It's just all the violence that did me in."
11,in_bruges,critics,fresh,p,"One of the strengths of this film, which is one of the year's best, is the way it gets more dire and nuanced with every character it introduces."
12,in_bruges,critics,fresh,p,... a fun and original feature film. [Full review in Spanish]
13,in_bruges,critics,rotten,n,The kind of movie that dabbles in playful allusions before it fizzles into a flat finale.
14,in_bruges,critics,fresh,p,"Its European setting places additional gravity on McDonagh's Irish-Catholic notions of reckoning-the knowledge that we have to pay for our sins, no matter how great or small."
15,in_bruges,critics,fresh,p,This is one of those movies that kicks off with a slow engine and picks up at full speed in the second half.
16,in_bruges,critics,fresh,p,... a knockdown and cockeyed comedy of violence.
17,in_bruges,critics,fresh,p,"I never expected to be moved by In Bruges, but I was."
18,in_bruges,critics,fresh,p,Those who know McDonagh's work know a vein of darkness will run deeply through the comedy. It has seldom been darker. Or funnier.
19,in_bruges,critics,fresh,p,"In Bruges is a wildly imperfect feature debut, but it does make you curious to see what else McDonagh has to offer."
20,in_bruges,audience,0.5,n,i hate this movie only because my english teacher made us watch it and i hate everything he loves
21,in_bruges,audience,5.0,p,fucking hilarious film!
22,in_bruges,audience,3.0,p,"The acting and production quality is top notch.  Unfortunately, the story is a bit meandering, and why do we care what happens to yet ANOTHER hitman, one of the more overused film tropes these days.  Also, so of the dialogue was trying too hard, like mimicking a Tarantino film."
23,in_bruges,audience,3.5,p,"Starts really think this is cooling down for a snooze but luckily it engaged 2nd gear just barely. Any good speed only the hour mark making it bit long winding, lack of flavor."
24,in_bruges,audience,4.0,p,"The film gets a bit implausible and overly sentimental towards the end, but not enough to ruin the movie.  The dialog is sharp and witty and the characterizations are wonderful, particularly Ralph Fiennes."
25,in_bruges,audience,0.5,n,Worthless garbage. Not worth watching.
26,in_bruges,audience,4.5,p,Martin McDonagh does not miss. I've now seen three movies directed by him and all got the same ****1/2 rating. This was way more fun than expected as Ferrell plays a very likable protagonist even if he's done something terrible. The side characters also add to the entertainment and the way everything ties together is remarkable.
27,in_bruges,audience,4.5,p,"Sure it's been mentioned before, but not in its own slot if I remember correctly. One of the best films since the turn of the century, Martin McDonagh's original, foul mouthed, violent and truly brilliant tale of two assassins sent to Bruges to await further instructions after a job gone wrong is a joy in every respect. An exceptional script is given the treatment it deserves by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, who are outstanding as the two assassins, helped along ably by one of the best Ralph Fiennes cameos you will ever see. Although In Bruges remains his best work to date, McDonagh's more recent work is also terrific, culminating in Oscar wins for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017)."
28,in_bruges,audience,4.5,p,"In Bruges is what I want from a movie like this. The mix of dark humor, brilliant screenplay and perfect Colin Farrell is just so awesome. The first half of the movie is the highlight of it and I just couldn't stop laughing at certain scenes. The restaurant scene with Farrell and Poésy might be the best in the movie. The wit and the simplicity of the screenplay is what make it so magnificent. The other half of the movie is awesome, but not that great. Still enjoyed it extremely well and the fact that this is the first film of Martin McDonagh is beyond me."
29,in_bruges,audience,3.5,p,Three Stars and Half 12/2021
30,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,It's a lot more meaty and soulful than you'd anticipate.
31,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"While being an excellent example of the power of friendship, Booksmart is also a warning to viewers that labels are dangerous."
32,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"There's something innately hilarious about watching the ""good kids"" losing themselves in bad behaviour."
33,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,It's at the top of the class.
34,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"Blending negatives with the swagger, insecurities, and skyrocketing emotions of teenagers, Book Smart ends up creating a positive concoction and an ode to friendship."
35,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"Booksmart is a movie about friendship, but it's also about how friendships grow and change as the people within them do as well."
36,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"Though it really shouldn't be at this point in time, it's exhilarating to see a film centered on teenage girls... Yet to champion the film as a universal reflection of teenage girldom rather than a highly specific fantasy also does it a disservice."
37,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"With elegant clarity, Booksmart demonstrates how certain experiences can feel colossal and of walloping import even when we know we're waiting for something else-something we can't possibly fathom."
38,booksmart,critics,rotten,n,A veritable grab-bag of high school movie conventions cranked up to 11.
39,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"Booksmart is a mostly sweet film that works hard to show the full depth of a female friendship. Showcasing two up-and-coming highly-talented actors, it's a movie that holds up well against other recent notable comedies."
40,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"It's certainly on the better end of the spectrum, but transcendent, it's not."
41,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,Like its main characters Booksmart is an overachiever that knows how to have a good time.
42,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"Refreshingly, the film's generous spirit extends to all its characters, whether geek or jock or cool kid. Unlike almost every other high-school movie, no one here is a mean girl in need of a comeuppance."
43,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"Fast, frank, graphically sexual exchanges populate the script, but it never becomes grating."
44,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"""With such a fully formed debut, it's hard not to fall in love with Booksmart. It offers laughs, tears and heart by the bucket-load"""
45,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"In the end, this is a movie you end up liking despite its faults."
46,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"A movie like Booksmart comes along to remind us that we were actually heroes, no matter what group we belonged to."
47,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"And Booksmart is incredibly smart to use a similar concept to tell a story that is much more at ease with itself, without trying to force a narrative."
48,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,"An astonishing coming-of-age story that hardly goes by the books and honestly, it's hard to believe that this is Olivia Wilde's directing debut."
49,booksmart,critics,fresh,p,Olivia Wilde is a tour-de-force of filmmaking.
50,booksmart,audience,5.0,p,Yeah all time favorite! Can watch over and over again and will still be as funny as the first time.
51,booksmart,audience,3.0,p,"Overrated film.  The type of film critics love because it hits all the right (left) political buttons of moment.  It does not work.  Having said that, there are some funny moments, most from co-stars, most hilariously Jason Sudekis. Sudekis doubling as a principal and Lyft driver for extra income said more about US than all the other forced ideas.  The leads were okay, but not enough chemistry between the two.  It didn't quite work.  Overrated does not mean awful.  If you like teen comedies this one has enough moments to sit through (although I fell asleep in last act)."
52,booksmart,audience,4.0,p,"entertaining, funny, and smart, yet problematic at times"
53,booksmart,audience,2.5,n,"Sometimes fun but mostly cliche and riddled with an awful, distracting soundtrack, Booksmart does nothing new for its saturated genre."
54,booksmart,audience,5.0,p,An excellent film that pushes boundaries and is hilarious at the same time.
55,booksmart,audience,2.0,n,"Aside from the soundtrack, everything in this movie is subpar."
56,booksmart,audience,5.0,p,Definitely a must see.
57,booksmart,audience,3.0,p,I enjoyed this.  The two young actresses did a good job.  The humor was witty.
58,booksmart,audience,0.5,n,"For all it's buildup and praise,  felt like this movie didn't live up to any of it.
Everything felt very amateur, and for the life of me I couldn't find the feminism in it, the scenes & the acting were very bland. 
If this movie was rated like any other normal movie, the ratings would be a lot lower, but it's pedestal as the ""new feminism"" movie has it rated different for some reason.
Disappointing."
59,booksmart,audience,3.5,p,"Funny, but definitely leaned too heavily on copying parts of Superbad. Even using Jonah hills sister in the Jonah hill role. Give it a watch, but not likely something I'd watch again."
60,young_frankenstein,critics,fresh,p,It is a comedy in which Brooks takes some creative liberties when it comes to addressing Shelley's work and uses Frankenstein's monster to parody Universal's horror movies with a hilarious and quite entertaining tone. [Full review in Spanish]
61,young_frankenstein,critics,fresh,p,"Its got wit, its got silliness, and it's chock full of one-liners, all made with love from Brooks. Young Frankenstein feels like a worthy homage."
62,young_frankenstein,critics,fresh,p,"Though it's fueled by memorable moments of dippy lampooning, it also carries on a touch too long; it's quite funny but ultimately not as polished as it could be."
63,young_frankenstein,critics,fresh,p,They don't do comedies like this anymore. Gene Wilder's performance is one for the ages. [Full review in Spanish]
64,young_frankenstein,critics,fresh,p,Miracles still happen: Mel Brooks has made a funny movie.
65,young_frankenstein,critics,fresh,p,"Young Frankenstein is sharply littered with slapstick humour, double entendre meanings and witty dialogue, thanks to the efforts of Wilder and Brooks."
66,young_frankenstein,critics,fresh,p,"It would seem that nothing new or noteworthy could still be gleaned from the Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley creation, but Mel Brooks with Young Frankenstein has done just that."
67,young_frankenstein,critics,fresh,p,"What it demonstrates is that for spoof to work, the spoofers must have deep affection for the material out of which they are wringing the wee."
68,young_frankenstein,critics,fresh,p,"This loopy send-up of classic chiller clichés from Universal's monster heyday is one of director Mel Brooks's best comedies, and it's also one of the genre's most thorough and successful fright film parodies."
69,young_frankenstein,critics,fresh,p,"Brooks has never been as inspired as in this movie, at the service of the viewer, for whom the seventh art was created. [Full Review in Spanish]"
70,young_frankenstein,critics,fresh,p,Puttin' on the ritz.
71,young_frankenstein,critics,fresh,p,Cloris Leachman and Madeline Kahn are also a riot in their roles.
72,young_frankenstein,critics,fresh,p,The ability of corny and literal gags to land on internationally diverse ears was infectious and heart-warming. It is also one of the most stunning black and white digital restorations I have seen.
73,young_frankenstein,critics,fresh,p,"The dream team of writer/director Mel Brooks and writer/star Gene Wilder know the text, the tropes and the best ways to turn them into comedy."
74,young_frankenstein,critics,fresh,p,"It's Mel Brooks at his most daft and puerile: sophisticated and silly, a black-and-white art film with schlong jokes."
75,young_frankenstein,critics,fresh,p,Well worth a watch.
76,young_frankenstein,critics,fresh,p,"The Brooks of 'Young Frankenstein' isn't really skewering the conventions of the horror movie - he's paying tribute to them, and using them as scaffolding for his particular brand of goofy, Borscht Belt burlesque."
77,young_frankenstein,critics,rotten,n,"It is good-natured, lowbrow, backlot, hit-or-miss humor, but with no cumulative effect beyond its succession of hard-worked jokes."
78,young_frankenstein,critics,fresh,p,... Brooks reveal(s) himself a true obsd and an honorable heir to the eerily delicate comic-horror tradition of James Whale.
79,young_frankenstein,critics,fresh,p,"It's a wonderful, iconic comedy. Mel Brooks' masterpiece!"
80,young_frankenstein,audience,4.5,p,"The gags may be lame, and the script is almost infantile, but if you thought this film was funny in 1974, you'll likely get a kick out of it today.  There's an unembarrassed corniness about Young Frankenstein that generates plenty of belly laughs.  The monster's, ""Puttin on the Ritz"" number will even squeeze smiles out of those not inclined towards Brooks' brand of humor.

The vaguely smutty jokes and sight gags will go over well with teens, but the comic talents at work here will appeal to all.  Marty Feldman, Teri Garr, Madeline Kahn, Cloris Leachman, and Gene Hackman comprise a comedy's dream cast.  Peter Boyle brings a touch of dignity to the monster, and Gene Wilder is as charming and manic as he was in Willy Wonka."
81,young_frankenstein,audience,5.0,p,"Forget ""Scream"", forget ""Scary Movie"", and forget all the so-called horror comedies. This is the ultimate classic, full of off-the-wall moments. Some parody the classic 1931 film, while others are brand new. Probably Brooks' masterpiece."
82,young_frankenstein,audience,4.5,p,Mel Brooks is at his absolute peak in comedic form.
83,young_frankenstein,audience,5.0,p,Simply one of the best comedies ever put on celluloid.

86,young_frankenstein,audience,3.5,p,Mel Brooks puts out some great movies. So many lol moments and homages to the original flick.
87,young_frankenstein,audience,4.0,p,"Incredibly funny with a great cast and beautiful music, it's a wonderful spoof of a great story that is thoroughly entertaining!"
88,young_frankenstein,audience,3.5,p,Classic comedy that everyone needs to see at least once
89,young_frankenstein,audience,3.5,p,"A very funny Mel Brooks film! Hilarious is the scene in which the little girl asks, 'What can we throw into the well next?', and the Monster comically rolls his eyes!"
90,withnail_and_i,critics,fresh,p,"A brilliantly funny, enduring classic with an unforgettable performance from Richard E Grant."
91,withnail_and_i,critics,fresh,p,British cult classic about two alcoholics; much profanity.
92,withnail_and_i,critics,fresh,p,"If you are in the right mood, it is simply impossible not to fall for this hilarious tale of two hard-living losers."
93,withnail_and_i,critics,fresh,p,Certainly the funniest and possibly the truest comedy about male friendship.
94,withnail_and_i,critics,fresh,p,"Every line is sharp, and the whole film finely judged and well paced."
95,withnail_and_i,critics,fresh,p,"A career high for all concerned, including '80s British cinema."
96,withnail_and_i,critics,fresh,p,"Perhaps Britain's most beloved cult film, Bruce Robinson's 1986 semi-autobiographical dark comedy is an obsessively observed character study."
97,withnail_and_i,critics,fresh,p,"One of the funniest elements of Withnail & I is that it concerns three varieties of drama queen: the flamboyantly dark-minded Withnail; neurotic, ill-equipped Marwood, and the larger-than-life Monty. [Blu-ray]"

99,withnail_and_i,critics,rotten,n,Has a particularly rabid following. Maybe one has to be English to really understand why.

101,withnail_and_i,critics,fresh,p,
102,withnail_and_i,critics,fresh,p,"It's much funnier, and sadder, watched stone-cold sober."
103,withnail_and_i,critics,fresh,p,A hilarious black comedy and already something of a cult favorite.
104,withnail_and_i,critics,fresh,p,"Set in 1969 England, it portrays the last throes of a friendship mirroring the seedy demise of the hippie period, delivering some comic gems along the way."
105,withnail_and_i,critics,fresh,p,It is at once a coming-of-age comedy and a fond farewell to an era.
106,withnail_and_i,critics,fresh,p,A modern classic? A brilliant vignette of a certain time and attitudes? A self-indulgent jeu d'esprit? One thing is certain: Richard E. Grant touched greatness.
107,withnail_and_i,critics,fresh,p,The best British comedy ever made? Possibly. A masterpiece? Unquestionably.
108,withnail_and_i,critics,fresh,p,Has any screenplay combined so many quotable lines with such tear-jerking pathos or blatant homophobia?

A fabulous, British, eccentric movie!"
111,withnail_and_i,audience,5.0,p,What absolute twaddle!! 😂😂😂😉😉😉
112,withnail_and_i,audience,4.5,p,"I don't really need to explain why this is brilliant i'm sure, but having watched it recently, it is incredible at how funny Withnail & I remains today, 34 years on. Richard E Grant's portrayal of the drunken Withnail is still his career best, although it's worth nudging you in the direction of his recent performance in Can You Ever Forgive Me (2018) which could be a distant relation to Withnail."
113,withnail_and_i,audience,5.0,p,"I discovered this absolute gem a few years ago and have now watched it at least 10 times.  Everything from the writing and performances to the set design and music are pitch perfect and immersive.  I immediately feel for Marwood and Withnail, wishing them out of their circumstances into success.  Danny and Monty and the Farmer are so specific.  This is the definitive dark comedy, and a love letter to the dingy London theatre scene."
114,withnail_and_i,audience,5.0,p,Must watch! Great script. Watched it millions of times. Classic
115,withnail_and_i,audience,5.0,p,One of the best movies of all time. It's a beautifully crafted delight.

Meh, it passed the time. 
Sort of. 😕

117,withnail_and_i,audience,2.0,n,"Poor, limited storyline, tedious dialogue in general despite a few witty comments here and there."
118,withnail_and_i,audience,3.5,p,A British Beavis & Butthead meets Wayne's World meets Quadrophenia
119,withnail_and_i,audience,4.0,p,"With its delightfully depraved and socially outcast characters, strange plot, cult status, and penchant for quotability, Withnail and I seems like a more subdued, British black comedy version of the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Stylistically, it feels very out of place; coming from the '80s it seems as if it were made either decades too late or decades too early, and given the proper promotion I could very easily see the film's peculiar humor and particularly its characterizations resonating with a new generation. The film is frustrating and comedic in virtually equal measure, and comes off as a brilliantly balanced example of its genre. Seeing Griffiths in this role really puts a different spin on Uncle Vernon keeping his nephew locked in a cupboard under the stairs, though. (4/5)"
120,whats_up_doc,critics,rotten,n,"It's a unique, noble effort to recreate the comedy stylings of a bygone era, but it's never completely convincing."

124,whats_up_doc,critics,fresh,p,"The film builds on itself, gaining speed as it careens out-of-control toward its conclusion. Only a director in complete control can fashion something so effortlessly chaotic."
125,whats_up_doc,critics,fresh,p,"Stands out as one of the great, if semi-forgotten comedy masterpieces of the 1970s."

131,whats_up_doc,critics,fresh,p,"It's never quite as tight or fierce as the original screwballers, but is fizzy and loveable and always worth watching."
132,whats_up_doc,critics,fresh,p,"Bogdanovich has delivered a film with energy, wit, and a madcap pace that is well worth watching."
133,whats_up_doc,critics,fresh,p,Never less than entertaining and is sometimes side-splittingly hilarious.

138,whats_up_doc,critics,fresh,p,
139,whats_up_doc,critics,rotten,n,Energetic contemporary takeoff on the Hollywood screwball comedies of the 1930s.
140,whats_up_doc,audience,2.0,n,"I used to think this was hilarious.  But no longer, even though there are still a few laughs.  That said, Streisand is beautiful and she sings two songs.  Ryan O'Neal spends a lot of time in boxer shorts, and he is totally buff. Madeline Kahn's film debut is interestingly subdued giving us a hint of her upcoming, home-run performance in ""Blazing Saddles"". AND yea, the final line slays."
141,whats_up_doc,audience,5.0,p,"An old-fashioned screwball comedy with a ridiculous cast of characters. Madeleine Kahn, as usual, stands out with her fully-fleshed (no pun intended) character, Eunice, who suffers her ditzy fiance Harold until he is enticed away by Judy, who trails mayhem and confusion in her wake. Barbra Streisand and Ryan O'Neill, as the main characters, have surprising chemistry and great comic timing, abetted by standout actors Austin Pendleton, Kenneth Mars, Mabel Albertson, Michael Murphy, and Sorrell Brooke. My favorite 1970s comedy."
142,whats_up_doc,audience,1.0,n,The stupidest movie I have ever seen. Save your time.
143,whats_up_doc,audience,5.0,p,Must've seen this first time 20 odd years ago and only recently re-discovered it -- bit slapstick but none the worse for that -- Steisand at her comedy best
144,whats_up_doc,audience,3.5,p,"I'd never seen this before so I wasn't sure what to expect but I was glad that it made me laugh. Not the best movie I've ever seen and IMO, not Barbara's best work. However, she and Ryan O'Neil made a great team. The ending is an absolute classic!! Hilarious!"
145,whats_up_doc,audience,5.0,p,One of my favorite comedies. Peter Bogdanovich was at his best. A great homage to  1930s comedies. Kenneth Mars and Madeline Kahn are SO funny! The plaid suitcases!
146,whats_up_doc,audience,3.0,p,"It's probably unfair that I liked it 12 times when I saw it before I was 12 years old.
Forty-five years later, it was just too silly to even be zany. Streisand saves it and Madeline Kahn shows why she will be a comedic force for years to come.

Otherwise, Bogdanovich's luster was already wearing off in this one."
147,whats_up_doc,audience,4.0,p,"A lighthearted romantic comedy that asks the question ""Am I happy making safe choices?"". Barbara Streisand is charming as the whitty Judy Maxwell and Ryan O'Neal is believable as the stressed out, anxiety riddled Howard"
148,whats_up_doc,audience,5.0,p,In my opinion this is a funny as it gets. top 10 all time comedy
149,whats_up_doc,audience,5.0,p,"A true hidden gem in today's world of big budget blockbusters, this film needs to be brought to a wider audience. It's a rare comedy that marries razor sharp wit with the dumbest of slapstick. The screwball mania that ensues is a sight to behold! It's complete and utter chaos by the third act, and demands to be witnessed by anyone who is interested in comedy."
150,mean_girls,critics,fresh,p,"Startlingly genuine when it comes to dialogue, stereotypes, coteries, and high school drama."
151,mean_girls,critics,fresh,p,"Fans of teen films will find much to like here, and those who have not so fond memories of high school will chuckle with familiarity."
152,mean_girls,critics,fresh,p,"If Mean Girls the movie had a human form, it would easily be the most popular kid in school. And like the vicious gossip that spreads throughout high school, Mean Girls has become an inescapable part of the cultural consciousness."
153,mean_girls,critics,fresh,p,Mean Girls is a funnier and more insightful movie than your average teen comedy.
154,mean_girls,critics,fresh,p,"Speaking to anyone who has survived the jungles of high school, Mean Girls has something for everyone. The refreshingly honest appeal of this film is ageless."
155,mean_girls,critics,fresh,p,"Like Heathers and Clueless, this box office hit turns out to be that rare teen flick that refuses to be pigeonholed as a teen flick."
156,mean_girls,critics,fresh,p,This is an all-star cast at the beginnings of their careers and their talent is evident even at this early stage.
157,mean_girls,critics,fresh,p,A very funny teen comedy
158,mean_girls,critics,fresh,p,"When we think of the great high school comedies, Mean Girls is near the top of the list because it's so fetch."
159,mean_girls,critics,fresh,p,"Mean Girls plays like the messed-up love child of filmmakers Hughes and Michael Lehmann in their 80s incarnations, which is like sooo in."
160,mean_girls,critics,fresh,p,Mean Girls is not only of the one most enjoyable films of the 21st century but it is also one that explores the wonderful comedic potential of women.
161,mean_girls,critics,rotten,n,"When the film is following the twists and turns of the mean girl schemes, it has an energy and a life that is fun and entertaining but it gets soft and sappy with a feel good finale that is pure grade A-bullshit."
162,mean_girls,critics,fresh,p,"Fizzes with peculiarly feminine evil, of the kind that comes dripping through a pillowy smirk garnished with baby-pink lipgloss."
163,mean_girls,critics,fresh,p,"The best of the recent clutch of teen movies, Mean Girls also represents a return to form for the filmmaking wing of Saturday Night Live."
164,mean_girls,critics,fresh,p,Mature but often-hilarious teen comedy.
165,mean_girls,critics,fresh,p,Lindsay Lohan is more likely to die before 30 than to land another lead role as suited to her (likely squandered) talent. Tina Fey's script is an observant equal-opportunity offender about how high school remains a jungle of hormones and haughtiness.
166,mean_girls,critics,fresh,p,"Like Heathers with the edges filed down a bit...the kind of smooth, clever (and rare) entertainment that critics and audiences can all enjoy, guilt-free. [Blu-ray]"
167,mean_girls,critics,fresh,p,"A very intelligent, often funny, well written and clever satire on high school and its status quo..."
168,mean_girls,critics,fresh,p,"The film boasts a solidly female cast, and its' a well cast film at that."
169,mean_girls,critics,rotten,n,"Like the wannabes at North Shore, Mean Girls longs to take a step beyond the ordinary, but it takes the easier, more traditional route instead."
170,mean_girls,audience,3.0,p,It's okay but I've never liked this as much as other people seem to. It's alright but I prefer House Bunny and many other films of this genre.
171,mean_girls,audience,4.5,p,The romance Plot is average but that's not why I watched it. I came here for the comedy and social satire and that was an awesome experience. Furthermore the quotability and the well made portrayal of Characters which one could call iconic elevated this movie from good to awesome.
172,mean_girls,audience,5.0,p,A classic movie with iconic actors! One of my favourites that I can watch over and over!
173,mean_girls,audience,3.5,p,"It was alright. Watching it recently I would probably not watch it again in the future. It has teenager cattiness, an alright story line but I would probably watch a movie from the 80's to get my high school vibes."
174,mean_girls,audience,4.5,p,It good movie enjoyed the girls in it and the acting and the way it was put together.
175,mean_girls,audience,5.0,p,"Smart humor.  Terrific story.  Just see it.  I give it an A, make a point to go see this movie."
176,mean_girls,audience,5.0,p,The perfect female coming-of-age teen comedy drama accurately portraying the vibes of the early 2000s
177,mean_girls,audience,2.0,n,"This movie was not great, as most of the jokes fell flat or were only moderately funny. Its ending is poorly written, and I would not recommend this film to anyone but high school girls.
2/10"
178,mean_girls,audience,5.0,p,There's nothing bad about this movie at all. 66%? That's good... I guess... but people could have liked it more than that. The only thing about this movie isn't really about the movie: what happened to Lindsey Lohan?
179,mean_girls,audience,4.0,p,"Very strong first half that starts to simmer down as things escalate. A little more than halfway trough the movie started to be a bit hard to sit trough, and while it took a while I think it bounced back at the ending. 
Overall great, can definitely see why it's regarded with so much praise, but the first and second halves just feel like two different movies."
180,princess_bride,critics,fresh,p,"The film was always wonderful, featuring clever conceits plus perfect looking cast members and locations."
181,princess_bride,critics,fresh,p,"As the picture practically spoofs the endeavors of Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn, it's also competent enough to craft its own identity as a swashbuckling thriller."

186,princess_bride,critics,fresh,p,"Everything about The Princess Bride is ... charming. By far, the film's dialogue is its most enduring legacy."
187,princess_bride,critics,fresh,p,...a lavish studio spectacle...
188,princess_bride,critics,fresh,p,"One of the all-time great fantasy movies, channelling both a rollicking spirit of adventure and genuinely uplifting humour all ages can appreciate."
189,princess_bride,critics,fresh,p,"A film that's for just about everyone and anyone that can appreciate good storytelling, a classic romance, riveting action, and genuinely funny comedy."
190,princess_bride,critics,fresh,p,"Mandy Patinkin, an actor not known for humor, is particularly wonderful as Inigo, a Spaniard out to avenge the death of his father at the hands..."
191,princess_bride,critics,fresh,p,It manages to be both tongue-in-cheek and achingly sincere.
192,princess_bride,critics,fresh,p,The Princess Bride is a worthy descendant to the Fractured Fairytales of yore. The characters -- both real and imaginary -- give every frame of The Princess Bride its own magic mirth.
193,princess_bride,critics,fresh,p,"It's an adventure which reaches back to golden-age Hollywood and the devil-may-care world of Douglas Fairbanks or Tyrone Power playing Zorro, or Errol Flynn playing Robin Hood."
194,princess_bride,critics,fresh,p,"The Princess Bride easily transcends expectations, as a fantasy that has a few pertinent things to say about the genre, including the odd fact that the heroes of such things are often prettier than the heroines."
195,princess_bride,critics,fresh,p,A unqualified success that blends New York wit with timeless storytelling; a risky piece of filmaking that never feels so.
196,princess_bride,critics,fresh,p,...it's ultimately not difficult to see why The Princess Bride has become something of a classic in the years since its 1987 release.
197,princess_bride,critics,fresh,p,...somehow spoofs the conventions of fantasy romance without teetering into irony.
198,princess_bride,critics,fresh,p,"As you watch this enchanting fantasy, feel free to be thrilled or to giggle, as you wish."
199,princess_bride,critics,fresh,p,"In spirit The Princess Bride recalls The Neverending Story, which also was about a contemporary boy`s fantastic adventure. Reiner's film is likely to please adults more than kids and to last in memory more than most films this fall."
200,princess_bride,audience,3.0,p,"Meh, didn't really live up to the hype. Maybe it just wasn't for me. Definitely could've lived without seeing this one."
201,princess_bride,audience,5.0,p,"this show has incredible charecters and great story with a lot of comedy, and i do'n't know if they meant to make it funny, but whatever they did it seemed to be hillaroiuse"
202,princess_bride,audience,5.0,p,one of the funniest films of all time!
203,princess_bride,audience,5.0,p,Not sure how there can be a better movie.  The perfect action/adventure/comedy based on a book that is of the same perfection.  The only gripe are the cut scenes where the grandfather is reading.
204,princess_bride,audience,4.0,p,Classic. Gets better with repeated viewings. Humour is spot on.
205,princess_bride,audience,5.0,p,"Genuinely one of the best fairy-tale movies of all time. An excellent cast, great effects, hilarious jokes, and compelling storyline make this a classic that should not be missed."

209,princess_bride,audience,5.0,p,Best fairy tale movie of all time the story/characters are so engaging and well written with good arcs especially indigo Montoya seeking revenge against the man who killed his father the main message of the film is that true love always prevails I can watch this classic again and again and not get tired of it
0,harold_and_maude,critics,fresh,p,"Essentially, no character in the film remains plain or unassuming; they're all overdone, exaggerated, and flamboyant - yet entirely believable."

2,harold_and_maude,critics,fresh,p,Bud Cort delivers one of the all-time cinematic expressions of existential horror.
3,harold_and_maude,critics,fresh,p,"The fact that [it] isn't very funny and, like its 80-year-old heroic, long outlives its necessary life, is less important than the fact that the characters frequently react gently or like credible human beings to the script's impossible notions."
4,harold_and_maude,critics,fresh,p,cuts through the superficial surfaces of conventional romance and digs into what actually draws people together
5,harold_and_maude,critics,fresh,p,"Unlike claustrophobically cute odd-couple movies, bottles some of the flavour of its time. Harold's fake suicides are a pale defiance and reflection of his cloistered, sapped life. The vital counterculture (Maude) helps Harold avoid the army."
6,harold_and_maude,critics,fresh,p,"This darkly humorous ,romantic comedy between an introvert adolescent and and old spunky woman, is playing it too safe to be considered truly anti-establishment, but it became a cult picture."
7,harold_and_maude,critics,fresh,p,A classic of dark comedy.
8,harold_and_maude,critics,fresh,p,"If there's one comedy to represent the woof and warp of the early '70s, ""Harold and Maude"" is it."

20,harold_and_maude,audience,3.5,p,"When Harold (Bud Cort), a wealthy young man obsessed with death, meets Maude (Ruth Gordon), an elderly woman obsessed with life, his life is changed for ever as their unique friendship gradually evolves into an even more unique romance.  While Hal Ashby's Harold and Maude may not be worthy of the cult following that it has, it remains an entertaining and inspiring story of life and love.  Not without its faults (Harold's antics grow tiring, some interior shots are weirdly framed, a lot of the attempts at comedy are overdone), it is buoyed by a knockout performance from Gordon, a great soundtrack from Cat Stevens, a totally original storyline, and a great vibe that can't help but make you feel really friggin' good."
21,harold_and_maude,audience,5.0,p,"A dark delight with a striking warmth.

Hal Ashby's black comedy romance drama Harold and Maude (1971) is a peculiar film with a multi-faceted style I enjoyed very much. It's very much a black comedy with morbid humor as Harold is a young man who wants to kill himself and you see him attempt various forms of faked suicides, and it's hilarious every time. John A. Alonzo shoots with a wide shot, so you can see all the suicide recreations and quirky dates Harold and Maude undertake.

Hal Ashby's direction deftly balances these otherwise dreary scenes into an upbeat comedy that is ultimately life affirming. Harold meets Maude, an older lady and develops a true fondness for her as she has fun with Harold and gets him to slowly start to appreciate living. There are heartfelt moments and absurd car chases to funny funerals. I was laughing at the ridiculous jokes, thinking about the existential crisis these two are having, while finding solace in their peaceful conclusion. Harold and Maude is unlike any other romantic comedy ever made.

Writer Colin Higgins wrote quite a brilliant script. You get to know the estranged and absurd relationship between Harold and his indifferent and frustrated mother. Vivian Pickles is hilarious as Harold's mother Mrs. Chasen as she arranges several dates for Harold, yet she's really ignoring him. Higgins' writing lets you know Harold feels depressed and neglected by his shallow mother as she can only think of his marriage as leading to his happiness or normalcy. Bud Cort is a young and interesting actor as he looks younger than he is as Harold Parker Chasen, while also conveying Harold's inner sadness naturally. He's quite good.

Ruth Gordon is hilarious and delightful as the exuberant Maude. You see how she loves life and plays around with stealing cars and trees to speed down the highway, taking every opportunity to have fun like skidding around corners at top speed. She's a treat to watch as she always feels genuine and kind, if insane at all times. Editors William A. Sawyer and Edward Warschilka cut quickly for a fast pace for 91 minutes like these car chase segments. 

I love when Tom Skerritt's highway patrol cop stops her in disbelief and dismay. It's a funny cameo. I liked director Hal Ashby's cameo at the amusement park with his distant stare and enormous beard. Cyril Cusack cameos as an artist doing a nude painting of Maude, while Charles Tyner portrays Ashby's anti-war sentiments and those of the hippies with his gung ho for war general. As he raves about the benefits of warfare and the military, you cannot help but notice wounded veterans, including Tyner with one arm that can only salute his nation with a missing arm. I enjoyed Ellen Geer's shallow actress Sunshine with her weird performance. Isn't she just perfect for Harold? Lastly, Eric Christmas' Priest character is a riot with his disapproval and disgust for Maude..

William Ware Theiss' costumes look just like stylish hippie suits and patterns, which fits 1971 perfectly. Cat Stevens' gentle folk songs adorn Harold and Maude with a bittersweet warmth and a musical calm at all times. You feel Cat Stevens adding a melancholy, yet his songs also sound happy or content with life in a way. Bob Stein's make-up ensures everyone looks dead and pale, especially Harold.

In all, Harold and Maude is all you need."
22,harold_and_maude,audience,3.5,p,"Bleakly and darkly comedic, Harold and Maude frequently appears in best romantic comedy lists. It's an odd film, there's no getting away from that, but often odd means interesting. The opening scene sees Harold seemingly hanging himself, only for us to quickly realise this is his favourite hobby, planning elaborate fake suicide attempts to shock his long suffering mother. It's an unusual past time, and clearly one that probably warrants therapy of some sort. But Harold's Mum is past making the time and effort for his issues, she persistently tries to set Harold up with various girls in a bid to imprint some sort of normality onto his life. But once Harold meets Maude, a seventy-nine year old lady who leads him on an amusing trail of mischief, all hope of a 'normal' romantic association goes out the window. Maude tries to impress upon Harold the importance of living life to the full, and their relationship is the story. It's heartwarming, weird, and very darkly amusing."
23,harold_and_maude,audience,2.5,n,"If Pugsley from the Addams Family grew up to look like Eric Forman from That 70's Show, you'd essentially have the Harold character in this movie. He pairs up with a nearly 80 year old peppy, kleptomaniac grandma who's high on life and teaches this emo kid a thing or two about living. It does get a bit ""weird"" in the last bit of this movie where a romantic relationship is formed between the two.. but well, love is a mysterious thing I suppose. Not bad I guess, maybe just odd and slightly amusing."
24,harold_and_maude,audience,4.5,p,"As with his later Being There, Ashby's film is something of a Heideggerian allegory about adopting an existential comportment of Sein-zum-Tode (""being-toward-death""). Because both our fairly fairytale protagonists in their own ways run away from death. On the one hand, Maude with her indefatigable, insatiable, anarchistic lust for life that is really no way to live at all, too socially destructive and ontologically isolating, a rejection of humanity's fundamental need for Mitsein (""being-with"") and a devaluation of death as just a fact of life. On the other, Harold with his pseudo-suicidal ideation, like Hamlet preferring to avoidantly act out rather than responsibly take action, his morbid curiosity a means of treating death as a perpetual fantasy that can be lived out, out lived, and thus ultimately lived without. Flip sides of the same coin, both must come to see that life and death, too, are flip sides of the same coin, that (as Heidegger puts it) ""as soon as one comes to life, they are at once old enough to die,"" so that escaping the boxes and cages that the establishment, the Man, das Man, tries to contain us in—the mechanical death camps of the holocaust, the algorithmic boxes of computer dating—means embracing the final pine box (perhaps cut from the same tree the couple plants in the forest) of the tomb."

Bud Cort's character's shtick of staging his own death gets tired quickly. Ruth Gordon brings a lot of energy to her role as a sprightly old lady with a zest for life, but it too soon becomes annoying and cloying. Maybe I'm just a grumpy old man."
27,harold_and_maude,audience,3.5,p,"Harold and Maude is an entertaining, if somewhat shallow, look at life and death through the eyes of an odd couple who wryly hate and raucously enjoy it, respectively. There are plenty of funny little scenes, like Harold's repeated (and repeated and repeated) fake suicide attempts and his mother's dry reactions to them that evoke the kind of morbid humor that would reach more mainstream success in the following decades. I agree with the criticism of one of the more pandering shots of the film, namely the 'incidental' focus on Maude's extermination camp tattoo without referencing it in dialogue that is intended to add some depth to her character by contrasting her bubbly personality, but ends up feeling unecessary. Taps into a teenage angst and rebellion that has endured to the present, and in a unique way, but is really hammered home by Gordon's caring and bright performance. (3.5/5)"

As for the story itself, it is meandering and uneven, but sometimes can be very funny. The Black Knight who still won't give up after losing all his limbs, Sir Robin the not-so-brave, the effeminate son of a tough lord, the three questions at the bridge, Castle Anthrax, and so on.

Laughter truly is the best medicine. I love artists and I have a special love for Comedians. It truly does suck what has happened to the pop culture landscape because of all the current nonsensical censorship trend that has run amock for far too long and have ruined so much. Anyway, I was looking for a laugh and decided to give Monty Python and The Holy Grail a watch and my craving was fulfilled. 

Taking the legend of King Arthur and giving it a low-budget silly humorous spin with a mix of utter nonsense and clever dialogue makes for a hysterical watch. One could also look at it as a high budget LARPing event. 

All the fine Blokes and Lasses performed wonderfully, particularly John Cleese as several characters and Graham Chapman as King Arthur. 

The Knights who say Ni were truly a special bunch that had me in stitches. Also, I could never get over the horse riding gag.  

Ni. Ni. Ni. 

I'd definitely recommend it if one is looking for a good laugh. I'll certainly be checking out other Monty Python material in the future. And if I were to rate this, I'd give it an 8/10."
56,monty_python_and_the_holy_grail,audience,5.0,p,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of funniest films of all time, and that is no understatement. Coming right off their television show; Flying circus, Holy Grail was conceived and directed by Terry Jones and Terry Gilham, as their first film in the trilogy ( we don't talk about "" And Now for Something Completely Different"" ). For a budget of only £229,000, the film doesn't feel cheap or cut back by any budget restraints, and instead fit inside of the joke, like the coconut gag, they couldn't afford horses so built around the lack of budget to create an entertaining and wacky film. The first viewing of this film left me roaring in laughter, rolling off my seat even before the beginning credits had even finished, I had never experienced that amount of laughter before watching this film and still remains a fond memory. The film has a legendary cult following, not surprising since the film is a joy to watch on repeat. Everything about it is great, from the classic cinematography of a Monty Python sketch, to the acting from John Cleese and the rest of the Python gang. This FEELS like the ultimate Monty Python sketch, taking such a... well... DARK AGE ( Little pun for you there), and creating comedy gold. From the 4th wall breaking to the sudden and surprising musical songs, Monty Python has gone all out with this film. The only thing that I could say that could ( for some people), let the film down would be its ending. It is a very British film so if you are not a fan of British humour, you might be a tad disappointed with the ending, however as a brit, the ending for me is bloody brilliant. Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a must see for all film lovers and everyone else in the universe, I highly recommend it to anyone who has a sense of humour."

Stay tuned to find out which passion she will choose to indulge, or if she will throw down her hair and declare herself a strong, independent woman. Fortunately, James L. Brooks manages to surprise with a story that is much more realistic, passionate, checkered, and entertaining.

The first aspect that stands out is the dialogue, which feels not only authentic but surprisingly witty, particularly whenever Albert Brooks gets to flex his comedy chops. You get a real sense of the frustration and the hopefulness, nailing home actual character development and a sense of legitimate drama that seemed poised at the outset to be destined for cheap pulp, soap opera-style conflicts. Holly Hunter gives such a good combination of professionalism and personal shortcomings, it's really wonderful to see in a decade that was painfully afraid to depict female characters in anything but positions of firm control, the slightest sign of realistic character design opening up accusations of sexism. More representation is great, but lip service alone would be derogatory towards women in film; it's the complex, human roles that really showed the acceptance of female characters in the medium. The ending might be a bit neat and defrays some of the supposed stakes of the main plot, but it's not like you're not happy seeing the epilogue that Brooks delivers.

Probably has to be among my favorite William Hurt performances as well, I'm just so used to seeing him play virtually the same character archetype of a dry, often emotionally pained 30-something  (Accidental Tourist, The Big Chill, even Kiss of the Spider Woman) that seeing some passion and happiness in one of his roles is a welcome change.

The combination of drama, romance, and comedy keeps things light and the scene of Albert Brooks as the fill-in anchorman is absolutely classic."
83,broadcast_news,audience,5.0,p,"Do you ever find yourself hemming and hawing to yourself like, ""Network"" or ""Broadcast News""? Which one did you revisit to study the media exploiting itself? Was it ""Network"" spitting from its ON monitor ""TURN IT OFF!""? 

I've seen ""Network"" enough and it's permanently ON, so the resolution didn't work. Neither did the endcap for this film which seemed like an awkward footnote that we didn't need, and could've been played in the background as the credits rolled, but overall this is a poignant take on what it means to be a journalist in the 80s.

Holly Hunter is great in this because she's just like Henry Rollins. Whenever someone meets Rollins they are shocked by how tiny he is because he's got a huge persona. The same goes for Hunter. She is a tiny little thing with one heck of a bang that bowls over the other actors around her.

Anyone who remembers this film is going to remember Holly Hunter crying, which is her character's ritual for cleansing the intensity she goes through minute to minute. No one on screen is as tightly wound as her character, which means when she lets her guard down, it really comes down.

You also see more behind the curtain of Oz in this than you do in ""Network"", as you see Brooks' character is smart and newsworthy, but he can't keep his jacket straight and sweats like a fraudulent Nixon on camera. William Hurt as his JFK-like nemesis understands his beauty almost too well, and struggles with the newsworthy when we find out he fake cried because he knows his fanbase responds to emotional reporting. 

""Network"" really builds rage for the industry of Oz, while this one pulls back the curtain in the most entertaining ways, showing the humans behind the media zoo."

85,broadcast_news,audience,4.5,p,"One of the James L Brooks greats, the writing, performances and general joy dished out to the moviegoer in Broadcast News marks a high point in 1980s filmmaking. Albert Brooks is at his strongest and while his flop sweat scene has become a cinematic comedy totem, the scene following with Jane Craig (Holly Hunter) is one of the most refined comedic and heartbreaking bits of scripted writing and actor's blocking that side of 1990. The film belongs to a certain era but with its humanity and degrees of human entanglement, it remains fresh and will continue to do so. Brooks' films aren't great visual masterpieces, but before The Simpsons, he honed in on family dynamics and a certain blend of comedy, truth and human suffering with an innate dynamism and entertaining combustability that captures us. In Broadcast News, you have a narrative that continues to surprise us. It's not an action film's twists and turns, but the turns of life, the subtle turns that still feel monumental while living them. In the highs there are lows, and in the lows there is heart and for that, this film (and Terms of Endearment, alike) will probably forever remain relevant. It's a simple joy, watching humans with flaws exist and try their best, and in Broadcast News you have 3 gifted actors doing just that. You won't have to try hard to enjoy it."

100,anchorman,critics,fresh,p,"By no means ... a great movie. But I not only understand why some people love it, I think I'm even beginning to love it a little myself."
101,anchorman,critics,fresh,p,"Laughs galore follow the well-paced humor as cameo performances by Jack Black, Tim Robbins, and Luke Wilson spice up the buffoonery ingeniously smacked at by the rest of movie's talented ensemble."
102,anchorman,critics,rotten,n,Relentlessly silly but not quite funny parody of 70s network news never quite lives up to its promise.
103,anchorman,critics,fresh,p,"Some of the material works, some doesn't."
104,anchorman,critics,fresh,p,"This goofy, energetic comedy flattens out at times but milks its 1970s setting and characters for numerous huge laughs."
105,anchorman,critics,fresh,p,"...like a 'Saturday Night Live' skit that got out of hand, a good idea that kept going and going but never quite jelled into a story."
106,anchorman,critics,fresh,p,"A crude, funny satire that tackles local television anchors and their newscasts. Those are easy targets to skewer, but the movie mines more truth from its subject than some in the biz will want to admit."
107,anchorman,critics,fresh,p,"Some of Anchorman is the kind of giddy, nonsensical stuff that can only emerge from a genuinely deranged comic brain."
108,anchorman,critics,rotten,n,"Ostensibly modeled on the egomaniacal Ted Baxter of the old Mary Tyler Moore TV series, this adventure's protagonist is less comical, less endearing, and generally grates on the nerves."
109,anchorman,critics,fresh,p,"Takes a joke and runs with it -- sometimes too far, but usually long enough to wear you down and force you to submit to its craziness."
110,anchorman,audience,4.5,p,"As over-the-top as it is absolutely hilarious, ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" stands as possibly Will Ferrell's best film, however, Rudd, Carell, Applegate, and Koechner all give hilariously strong performances as well. The entire film is absurd (a bit too absurd for some possibly), though I found myself having loads of fun watching this movie. The story and message in the end are brilliant, and the cameos are brilliantly mixed into the movie. The soundtrack is another thing that is done great. About the only thing that I can really say is bad about this film is that it can become a bit preachy, but honestly that's about it. Overall, a phenomenal film that stands as one of the best comedy movies of all time."
111,anchorman,audience,5.0,p,"If you are a male under the age of 60, you are quoting this movie at least 3 times a day. The gold that they struck here will never be forgotten and the laughs never stop. If this comedy isn't 5 stars, then what comedy could be?"
112,anchorman,audience,4.5,p,"One of the most quotable films of the 2000's. It has such a big cast with some great cameos from celebs too. For a film set in the 1970s, it feels modern but it does limit some jokes. Still, has plenty of fun moments thanks to Will Ferrell and his creative control."
113,anchorman,audience,3.5,p,The comedic take on the theme of the film is greatly delivered with well placed humour and delivery from the cast. This film is an ace of its genre or its kind of film and it can truly speak to an audience while giving worth to the story it tells.
114,anchorman,audience,4.5,p,"One of the funniest movies ever, and perhaps one of the most quotable. Between Ron and Brick this movie is going to make you laugh the whole way through. Ferrell was meant to play this role"
115,anchorman,audience,5.0,p,"So stupidly funny, I loved it!"
116,anchorman,audience,4.0,p,Felt like watching a bunch of teenager's school project. Pretty awesome movie.
117,anchorman,audience,4.0,p,"Solid performances with tons of quoted lines.  Odds are even if you haven't seen it, you've heard the jokes.  Worth seeing in context, and the jazz flute scene is still worth the price of admission."
118,anchorman,audience,4.0,p,Anchorman is a great movie full of laughs and originality!!!!
119,anchorman,audience,3.0,p,"It's silly, even inappropriate, at times, but it gives it's fair share of laughs. 6/10"
120,blockers,critics,fresh,p,A very silly movie that makes several very serious points.
121,blockers,critics,fresh,p,"With Blockers, the bar for raunchy studio sex comedies has been raised to thrilling, unprecedented heights."
122,blockers,critics,fresh,p,"While wholly unrealistic, the conversations between the adolescent teens are actually quite clever, demonstrating a comical lack of clarity about intercourse."
123,blockers,critics,fresh,p,I went into Blockers wanting to laugh a lot after a couple days and the film provided me with the escapism medicine that I was craving. Nothing cures sadness like well-designed comedy.
124,blockers,critics,fresh,p,"Blockers is timely, laugh-out-loud-so-much-it-hurts-your-face-funny and heartfelt."
125,blockers,critics,rotten,n,It'd be a lie to call Blockers a waste of time. It's just that it wastes its own time too often.
126,blockers,critics,fresh,p,"While advertisements fool us into thinking we're getting something raunchy, we end up experiencing a story that has more than just titillation on its mind."
127,blockers,critics,fresh,p,"With discrete ideas about sexism, feminism and sexual orientation behind its character development, this is a comedy that breaks out from the rest. [Full review in Spanish]"
128,blockers,critics,fresh,p,"If nothing else, it's a welcome change to see teens, especially young women, portrayed as competent, thoughtful, and capable of making not only their own decisions, but good decisions."
129,blockers,critics,fresh,p,"In times like these, we can use a good laugh, and Blockers has plenty."
130,blockers,critics,fresh,p,"John Cena, playing against his tough-guy persona, steals the show as the most sensitive parent."
131,blockers,critics,fresh,p,"As a comedy, the film is hysterical; all three leads performances are unmistakably funny."
132,blockers,critics,fresh,p,Blockers is able to be a fun teen comedy and an Apatow-style arrested development adult comedy at the same time. It works.
133,blockers,critics,fresh,p,"Blockers is a welcome addition to the teen sex comedy genre, and a far cry from the days of American Pie and Varsity Blues."
134,blockers,critics,fresh,p,"What a relief female filmmaker Kay Cannon hit this one out of the park, and how nice the writers and producers, who were all men, realized they should have a female voice at the helm."
135,blockers,critics,rotten,n,"[""Blockers""] lacks sophistication. It treads down the path of gross-out comedies that want to outdo the previous one."
136,blockers,critics,fresh,p,"This is a sexy, gross take on the relationships of parents and kids as they grow up and out. It could have been very sappy and trite, but it is neither because it is smartly written and directed."
137,blockers,critics,fresh,p,"Nevertheless, at a brisk 102 minutes, which flies by thanks to the bulk of the action being set around a single night, a solid gag rate and immensely likeable cast, this is a funny and surprisingly moving treat."
138,blockers,critics,fresh,p,"There are some issues like the pacing and the way that the emotional elements work in and sometimes the jokes don't always land, but the good parts are really good."
139,blockers,critics,rotten,n,"It all starts going downhill around the time Jon Cena drinks beer through his butt. Until then, Blockers is a rather savvy and -- if you squint really hard -- even subversive comedy."
140,blockers,audience,3.5,p,"This is a unique, modern take on a teen comedy.  The message here is how to raise your children and then trust them enough to let them go.  This harkened back to the American Pie series as the directors trying to do the right thing by the sexual politics of our time."
141,blockers,audience,3.0,p,Funny which is about all you can ask for
142,blockers,audience,4.0,p,The film is crazy funny.
143,blockers,audience,3.5,p,"It's fun. I think a lot of the negative audience reviews are from people who wanted to see a movie about parents stopping young women from having sex, but then realized the movie is about the double standard our society treats women with. And much of America just isn't ready for that yet because they still think women should be controlled. These people aren't actually capable of growth so we just have to progress without them. The movie was funny and not too heavy. Give it a try. John Cena surprised me with how funny he can be here."
144,blockers,audience,4.0,p,Very funny humour and the whole cast nails it!!!!
145,blockers,audience,2.5,n,"One of the biggest mixed bags I've ever seen. With some actual talent in the cast but one god awful script trying to imitate teens. Blockers has one or two good jokes from John Cena, who carried the entire film, but most are just cringe inducing filler. It's one of those movies that can be fun when watching with a group of friends, but is just boring filler when watching alone. The adults can be okay at times but feel overprotective and do stuff no sane adult would ever do to their child, but where did it go wrong when writing the teenagers? Why did the writers think it was a good idea making all their personalities just ""Horny""? All they can talk about is stuff you do under the sheets, they have 0 personality besides that. Don't watch this movie unless you wanna joke around with some friends and all have a dirty sense of humor."
146,blockers,audience,5.0,p,great comedy make sense and works on multiple levels
147,blockers,audience,3.0,p,Watched the movie because I heard John Cena was in it and was pleasantly surprised to find out Kathryn Newton was also part of the cast. Had heard some positive word of mouth going in and it's safe to say what little expectation I had of the movie it lived up to it and even exceeded it in a certain aspect.
148,blockers,audience,0.5,n,"Don't bother with Blockers. It's really bad. Some of the acting is beyond atrocious, and the jokes don't work. I find it incredible a film like this gets a fair bit of acclaim, when there are far better comedies out there, many of which get slammed."
149,blockers,audience,5.0,p,"Hilarious and raunchy, ""Blockers"" will be one not to forget."
150,21_jump_street_2011,critics,fresh,p,With little in the way of a compelling story the jokes make up for the lack of plot with a hit rate of roughly 70%. More than enough to achieve a passing grade.
151,21_jump_street_2011,critics,fresh,p,"A deluge of action, some noteworthy cameos, and the always-reliable vulgar comedy to contrast with the more intelligent, self-aware mockery."
152,21_jump_street_2011,critics,fresh,p,"Do you want to laugh? Do you find Hill's usual brand of humor funny? If so, you'll likely have a blast."
153,21_jump_street_2011,critics,fresh,p,"In 2012, did anyone expect a ""21 Jump Street"" movie to be good? Because it is."
154,21_jump_street_2011,critics,rotten,n,"The postmodern posturing speaks less to me of the film's wit, and more as disingenuous apologism for its own laziness and lack of originality."

156,21_jump_street_2011,critics,fresh,p,"Despite all the coy formula-flipping and compulsive jokes, what wins us over is the odd-couple chemistry of the two leads."
157,21_jump_street_2011,critics,fresh,p,To my surprise it turned out to be the big hulking anatomical joke-spewing genuine bromance-building raunchcom that could.
158,21_jump_street_2011,critics,fresh,p,"A surprisingly strong film with a solid balance of humor and heart, actually making us feel for and identify with the characters rather than just go through the usual paces of an R-rated comedy."
159,21_jump_street_2011,critics,fresh,p,"It knows it is rather silly fluff, so it revels in its own raunchy silliness -- creating a comedy that delivers plenty of laughs."
160,21_jump_street_2011,critics,fresh,p,A surprisingly sharp film that mixes several genres together - and then subverts them all.
161,21_jump_street_2011,critics,rotten,n,"Sure, references to ""Glee"" and Robert Downey Jr.'s drug years may not hold up quite as well in 20 years, but in an era of disposable pop culture, ""21 Jump Street"" is anything but, likely to be namechecked for a lot longer."
162,21_jump_street_2011,critics,fresh,p,"All in all, this is not the atrocity it could have been and offers plenty of laughs to followers of the original and the uninitiated."
163,21_jump_street_2011,critics,fresh,p,"... 21 Jump Street is consistently funny throughout, with a few really huge laughs peppered in the script."
164,21_jump_street_2011,critics,rotten,n,"Not that the original series was high-brow/must-see television, but I figured any remake of it in the 21st century would at least be far more ambitious than this tired bit of recycling."
165,21_jump_street_2011,critics,fresh,p,"Fast, funny and smarter than its dunce-cap demeanor lets on."
166,21_jump_street_2011,critics,fresh,p,A lot smarter and a lot funnier than it has any real right to be.
167,21_jump_street_2011,critics,fresh,p,Chaotic and far-fetched yet funny enough to have audiences rolling in the aisles.
168,21_jump_street_2011,critics,rotten,n,"Given the broad drama of the series, their movie should be full of big ideas, and instead settles for redundant gags involving drugs, guns, and high school cliques."
169,21_jump_street_2011,critics,fresh,p,The supporting characters add depth to the comedic pairing of Tatum and Hill.
170,21_jump_street_2011,audience,3.5,p,"A very decent adaptation to the young adult drama that I watched when I was a kid. Channing and Jonah have good chemistry, I'll give it that, but I didn't laugh as much as I thought I would."
171,21_jump_street_2011,audience,4.0,p,A great satire of the 1980s original it offers mainstream comedy in a way that appeals to all.  Tatum and Hill were a good duo.
172,21_jump_street_2011,audience,5.0,p,"The movie that I decided to do for the Public Film Criticism Assignment is 21 Jump Street. This action and comedy movie was made in 2012 starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, Brie Larson, Dave Franco, Rob Riggle, and Ice Cube. 21 Jump Street is rated R for crude and sexual content, pervasive language, drug material, teen drinking, and some violence. The film was directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, which was Lord's and Miller's first time directing a live-action movie. It was written by Jonah Hill and Michael Bacall. The film was edited by Joel Negron. The lighting of the movie stays consistent throughout the movie even if the day of time changes or the tone of the scene. The shot is changed when it is necessary to the plot or when to display the actor's comedic skills. When there is an action scene, the editing becomes quicker, and the shots are shorter to grasp the audience's attention. The movie was released in theatres on March 16, 2012, and received positive feedback and grossed $201 million ($138.4 million in the United States and Canada and $63.1 million in other countries). The run time for the movie was 109 minutes and the language was in English. The sequel, 22 Jump Street was released on June 13th, 2014. The score for the film was created by Mark Mothersbaugh which includes 21 songs and sold over 2,000 copies. Some of the most popular songs included ""Party Rock Anthem"" – LMFAO, ""Straight Outta Compton"" – N.W.A, ""The Real Slim Shady"" – Eminem.  21 Jump Street was filmed in Metairie, Louisiana. A poster was used to market 21 Jump Street. The poster included Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum in white suits holding guns, with a senior prom background to represent that they undercover as senior high school students. The catch phased used on the poster was, ""The only thing getting blown tonight is their cover"". The movie also had a trailer promoting the new movie which came out months before. It consisted of a three-minute film plot about how two cops have to go undercover as senior high school students to find out who the drug supplier was in the school. The strengths of the 2012 movie, 21 Jump Street, were the lead actors, Jonah Hill, and Channing Tatum. The actors did a funny performance playing as ""bad"" cops, and it was very clear that the two have great chemistry on and off the screen. The movie also had great action scenes such as car chasing and crushing, and when Tatum and Hill were shooting at the drug dealers. One of the weaknesses of the film could be the dark humor. I believed the humor was funny, however, it could have rubbed off the wrong way for other people. ""On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 85% based on 226 reviews and an average rating of 7.20/10."" Many other public critics seemed to genuinely enjoy the film stating that it made them laugh and smile. 
The film began when Morton Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Greg Jenko (Channing Tatum) went to high school with each other. Jenko was an athletic jock who picked on Schmidt who was a nerdy introvert. Years after high school, Jenko and Schmidt attended the same police academy in which was when their friendship blossomed when they decided to help each other's weaknesses. Schmidt agreed to help Jenko with his studies while Jenko promised Schmidt to help with his physical strength. After graduating from the police academy, the two new cops are assigned a specialty division on 21 Jump Street. They are introduced to Captain Dickinson (Ice Cube) who explains their new undercover mission as high school students is to stop the new synthetic drug from spreading to other campuses by finding the supplier. Schmidt and Jenko figure out that Eric, who is played by Dave Franco, is the lead dealer of the school, however, he is not the supplier. Schmidt manages to become close to Eric and his popular friend group to find out who is giving Eric the drugs, while Jenko becomes friends with the ""nerds"" in his AP chemistry class. He discovers that his chemistry friends can hack into people's phones, and Jenko asks them to hack into Eric's phone. Schmidt has a plan to throw a huge party at his parent's house while they were away on vacation to gain Eric's trust. Meanwhile, Jenko steals Eric's phone from his back pocket and gives it to his AP chemistry friends so they can hack into it and find out who the supplier is. After gaining Eric's trust, Eric tells Schmidt that the drug deal is happening during prom. Both Schmidt and Jenko have to be careful during the drug bust so they do not blow their cover. During the prom, they find out who the drug supplier is and stop the spread of the synthetic drug. I honestly loved this movie and I give it a 5/5 (0 being a terrible film, 5 is a great film). I was upset the other night and I wanted to put on a comedy/ action movie to make me feel better, and this movie put a smile on my face. Immediately after watching 21 Jump Street, I watched the sequel, 22 Jump Street. I thought that Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill gave an amazing and funny performance which made me laugh hard. Their connection on-screen was remarkable and you can tell that they got along off-screen as well. I thought it was ironic how the character Jonah Hill played was a cop and did not know how to use a gun and Channing Tatum's character who was also a cop did not know his Miranda Rights. I would recommend this movie to an audience who enjoys comedy and action movies over the age of 18. The movie does have sex scenes and violence which needs parental permission for kids. This movie also does have some messed-up jokes which could rub off or offend some audience. Overall, this film was well produced, had great songs, and amazing well-known actors who would pop up throughout the film."
173,21_jump_street_2011,audience,4.5,p,"With very solid humor, and the combined performances of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, 21 Jump Street is frivolous fun, while having a unique direction style from Phil Lord and Chris Miller."
174,21_jump_street_2011,audience,3.5,p,"At the time I was surprised with this being a decent comedy. Of course, now Lord and Miller are pretty established as making decent movies."
175,21_jump_street_2011,audience,3.5,p,"A really cool and silly comedy movie that doesn't take itself to seriously. It's funny and enjoyable. The Duo was absolutely fantastic. My favorite thing about this movie is for sure Ice Cube's characters, i loved him! A very nice movie with little bit of moral about friendship. 
7/10"
176,21_jump_street_2011,audience,4.5,p,"For the first minute and a half I thought this was just another conventional high school movie....then they graduate and the real fun starts. This goofball movie is a joy from (near) start to finish and never takes itself too seriously. Kudos for satirizing millennials at both ends of the age spectrum at once, for calling doves 'badass', and for the funniest green suit since Kermit the Frog."
177,21_jump_street_2011,audience,5.0,p,"Another incredible ride, nothing else to say here. 5/5"
178,21_jump_street_2011,audience,4.0,p,This film was hilarious! The leading Duo does a fantastic job too. I would absolutely recommend this film to any fan of a ridiculous comedy.
179,21_jump_street_2011,audience,4.0,p,It was surprisingly refreshing. The two leads have great chemistry and are hilarious together. Johnny Depp was also a nice surprise cameo I did not expect at all. #justiceforjohnnydepp

200,1001115-apartment,audience,5.0,p,One of my all time favorites. In watch it almost every year around Christmas.
201,1001115-apartment,audience,5.0,p,"The master screenwriter/director at the peak of his powers.

One of the most masterful, tightest scripts in cinema. Nothing is in there as a throwaway, everything has a place, even if seemingly inconsequential in itself and of course the delightful dialogue has Wilder's stamp all over it.

Wilder mixes this superb script with his own visual style. A Rom-Com yes, but without question the film is about loneliness. Shirley McLaine gives a delightfully touching performance as Jack Lemmon adds a comedic and subtle touch to his character. Both play likeable albeit naïve, lonely characters getting manipulated by the same person. Suffice to say they're both complex characters. 

In essence it is a Rom-Com but with a typically Wilder-esque cynical and dark twinge to it.

A must watch. If you're not a Rom-Com fan don't be put off by this. This is one of the most original Rom-Coms (admittedly a dark and cynical one) you're ever likely to see and is a must watch and much like with Some Like It Hot a fabulous last line."
202,1001115-apartment,audience,2.0,n,"A truly sexist disappointment.

Billy Wilder's romantic comedy-drama The Apartment (1960) is not the hailed comedy critics and audiences would have had me believe. This film is so disappointing to me. It's not funny, so it fails as a comedy for me. The drama is so melodramatic and it's not romantic as the leads are barely together. Shirley MacLaine and Jack Lemmon are the only parts that work for me. Fred MacMurray is just so slimy and unfunny to watch doing what might as well be an impression of Burt Lancaster in Sweet Smell of Success (1957). MacLaine's Fran feels like a modern woman stuck in a male dominated corporate, toxic work environment. However, Billy Wilder does little to make her character feel empowered as I never believed she'd stick with MacMurray's cheating boss for so long after endless betrayals. I know in real life some women ride or die for cheaters, but it doesn't make for a fun romantic comedy. The Apartment is a depressing drama through and through.

I found it tasteless and old-fashioned, clearly written by two men with no genuine compassion or empathy for how women feel, think, or act. Writers Billy Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond leans so heavily into portraying every businessman as a sleazy, sexist, womanizing cheater that I'm not having fun watching men belittle women. I'm dumbfounded how so many women viewers adore The Apartment. I found it condescending, sexist, and unpleasant. I was in a great mood going into The Apartment, but now I just feel down.

I recently watched Billy Wilder's 1955 comedy The Seven Year Itch, which also delighted others, but I found it to be dated, sexist, and unfunny in all the wrong ways. Much to my absolute horror and profound disappointment, The Apartment is just as sexist and also about the exact same topic of cheating men. Wilder's direction is slow and the entire movie barely got a smile out of me. 

It's one thing to make a comedy making fun of businessmen cheating on their wives, but The Apartment tries so hard to sympathize with the cheaters and makes the women all look like saps who desperately cling to these scumbags. I honestly loathe films like this and I've enjoyed Billy Wilder's comedy Some Like It Hot, but The Apartment fell flat for me. I'll stick with his impeccable dramas like Witness for the Prosecution, Sunset Boulevard, or Double Indemnity. Even those serious pictures have more humor in them than The Apartment.

Editor Daniel Mandell could have cut this dragging 125 minutes down to 80 for such a thin narrative. Who cares if Joseph LaShelle's cinematography is pretty or if Adolph Deutsch's score is lovely, if the romantic comedy aspect doesn't work for me at all? 

I liked Jack Lemmon fumbling his way into romance, but he's supposed to be this nice guy who helps the sweet and innocent Shirley MacLaine, but he's also helping these men to cheat to climb the corporate ladder, so I have little to no sympathy for Lemmon's C.C. ‘Bud' Baxter either.

Shirley MacLaine is the sole light of The Apartment with a forward feeling performance that lends the audience to empathize with a woman dating a married man whom she still loves. But I just don't find that women should keep seeing a married man once she knows he's married and is the type of sleaze who will never leave. It makes MacLaine's progressive woman feel dumb and naive.

In all, I'm just sad that I didn't find The Apartment to be a funny comedy that holds up. It's not very romantic and the drama just feels sour with its very male centric perspective and I'm a man sick of these infidelity stories. So glad I didn't watch this one on a date!"
203,1001115-apartment,audience,5.0,p,"One of the best I've seen, movie-wise."
204,1001115-apartment,audience,3.5,p,it is an entertaining comedy with enough drama to keep it balanced.
205,1001115-apartment,audience,4.5,p,"The apartment's relentless old-timey charm that is so often fondly spoken of nowadays yet so rarely used with such grace and elegance, shine bright. The central performances driving this movie, those of Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, are graceful, funny and just as if not more charming as the screenplay."
206,1001115-apartment,audience,5.0,p,"Great movie from start to finish,it's definitely a true classic. Worth a watch!"
207,1001115-apartment,audience,4.0,p,A classic. Maybe Jack Lemmon's best movie.
208,1001115-apartment,audience,3.5,p,A pretty good comedy though it has many flows of older Hollywood and main characters personality (blabber head) really made it hard for me to like him
209,1001115-apartment,audience,4.5,p,"A truly beautiful movie about finding love. Even for a movie made so long ago, the themes feel modern. There are a few moments but I chalk it up to the time period. There are a lot of major twists throughout the movie revolving around Jack Lemmon's character, C.C. Baxter, and the men in his office. It was directed amazingly and cast just perfectly. Jack Lemmon rides that edge between dark and funny/awkward so well it is enticing. I highly recommend ""The Apartment""!"

2,adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert,critics,fresh,p,"The true heart of the movie, though, is Terence Stamp. He may be a little stiff in the show routines but, offstage, he's a revelation, giving a performance of near-perfect restraint and dignity."
3,adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert,critics,fresh,p,"Tremendous fun, with a deliciously sugar-coated message, this is the closest the cinema has come to a proper musical in years."

5,adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert,critics,fresh,p,"Outrageous and giddy, the main characters in this movie make The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert a summer entertainment that won't soon be forgotten."
6,adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert,critics,fresh,p,"To its credit, whenever things get too treacly, Priscilla knows enough to break out those frocks and get the show in gear. That is entertainment for sure."
7,adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert,critics,fresh,p,"Not everything works equally well in this road movie, but writer-director Stephan Elliott keeps things watchable."
8,adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert,critics,fresh,p,Fabulous and emotive.
9,adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert,critics,fresh,p,I wasn't prepared for the generosity and gorgeousness with which Aussie writer-director Stephan Elliott turn this most unlikely road picture into something arresting -- if a tad sentimental -- in its naive vision of a perfectly tolerant world.
10,adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert,critics,fresh,p,"The plot of Priscilla isn't as important as the outlandish, wicked dialogue , the wild costumes and makeup, and the general high spirits of the entire enterprise."
11,adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert,critics,fresh,p,It's a road movie that's anything but typical or traditional.
12,adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert,critics,fresh,p,"Where else are you going to see General Zod, Agent Smith and the guy from Memento as drag queens stranded in the Australian Outback?"
13,adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert,critics,fresh,p,It's hard not to be swept along.
14,adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert,critics,fresh,p,"The best things in this transsexual comedy-melodrama are Lizzy Gardiner and Tim Chappel's colorful costumes, which deservedly won the Oscar, and Terrence Stamp's performance, snubbed by the Academy."
15,adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert,critics,fresh,p,"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert presents a defiant culture clash in generous, warmly entertaining ways. For all its glitter, this is the sort of film in which everyone becomes happier and nicer by the final reel."

Not just a highly impactful film for its welcoming and outright celebratory depiction of drag queens and transsexual characters, Priscilla is both a downright hilarious and pretty damn quotable road comedy as well as a solid exploration of identity and a personal retrospective, all balled up into one delightful package. I personally grew up knowing all three members of this trio (Stamp, Weaving, and Pearce) from completely different types of material, which made the way each of them disappears into their respective characters all the more impressive and enjoyable; Stamp with his no-nonsense tone and dismissive, snappy dialogue was a particular treat. The film places the three lip syncers in a bus through the outback while mixing them together in enough of a cocktail of confrontation, inter-group drama, jokes, and personal growth to make you feel involved with the characters through the comedy and drama alike. If the film had decided to go down a more pained route with excessive pushback by the bogans or a lack of family support, it would come off as far less sincere; instead, we get sold on the entertainment and pleasantly surprised by the camraderie. 

It's tough to discuss a film so influential in establishing mainstream acceptance of LGBTQ cinema without mentioning the surprising inclusion of Cynthia, a Filipina woman who seems straight out of a particularly bad Family Guy cutaway gag. In a story that focuses on breaking down preconceptions about stigmatized groups, her opportunistic and vulgar traits seem a bit callous, yes, but I'm willing to give the creative team the benefit of the doubt and say her design was not so much intended to be harmful as it was just poorly thought-out. 

I imagine the Wachowski siblings in 1994 seeing a transgender Hugo Weaving character in a surprisingly successful Australian road comedy-drama with lines like, ""my tits are falling down,"" and turning to each other with a simultaneous ""he's perfect."" (4/5)"
21,adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert,audience,4.0,p,"Featuring a trio of fantastic central performances, and a sensitive supporting one from Bill Hunter, Priscilla, QOTD is a frequently hilarious romp into the vast Australian Outback, exploring issues of identity, intolerance and acceptance. The dialogue feels so natural because its exactly the kind of thing you might hear from a group of friends on a road trip, slinging good-natured abuse at each other, with the occasional sharper insult thrown in here and there. I've heard it said that in the past few decades, gay people weren't written very well, at least not written like actual, 3 dimensional characters. It was simply a case that their homosexuality was the sum total of their personality, like it was the only thing that distinguished them. Here, our 3 leads are distinct characters, with heir own flaws and quirks, and their orientation and lifestyle is what unites them, rather than defines them. Our leads experience all kinds of different reactions to their lifestyle, ranging from confusion to hostility and indifference to celebration. A lesser film would just have had everybody spewing homophobia remarks towards them wherever they went, and it would have made for repetitive, depressing viewing. On a separate note, as someone who lived in Australia for close to 2 years, I was glad to see how well the film captured not only the country's staggering natural beauty, but also its unbelievable size and desolation. Overall, it's a very entertaining story filled with both warmth and humour. It's a milestone in LGBTQ+ cinema, and has an entertaining plot to go along with its important message."
22,adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert,audience,5.0,p,"I laughed my butt off watching this Australian Movie, they really know how to do it in the land down under!"
23,adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert,audience,5.0,p,"Fabulous and ahead of its time. Although I would have preferred to have at least one openly gay actor playing a lead role, the actors all did a fantastic job. Recommend 100%."
24,adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert,audience,5.0,p,"After so many years I still fell the same emotions I felt the first time I saw it (thank you Terence Stamp, Guy Pearce and Hugo Weaving)"
25,adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert,audience,4.0,p,"I really liked this movie, it really captured what being a drag queen is really like."
26,adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert,audience,5.0,p,Terence Stamp should have gotten an Oscar for this amazing performance.
27,adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert,audience,3.0,p,Not especially funny but the performances are really good.
28,adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert,audience,4.5,p,"A group of drag queens travel Australia's outback. A few fish-out-of-water scenes offer humorous, and not so humorous, encounters with the locals. Excellent performances by a talented cast, who at times come close to caricature without stepping over the line."
29,adventures_of_priscilla_queen_of_the_desert,audience,0.5,n,Not my up of tea. I like other stories.
30,mrs_doubtfire,critics,fresh,p,"You can't take Mrs. Doubtfire seriously for a moment, its daddy-track sympathies notwithstanding, and you'll know exactly where it's going at every turn. You'll laugh, though Robin Williams will not be denied,"
31,mrs_doubtfire,critics,fresh,p,"A somewhat grotesque take on Mary Poppins, this picture has an attitude and style all its own."
32,mrs_doubtfire,critics,rotten,n,Anybody tempted by nostalgia should stay away to preserve the illusion that this was once so well-liked.
33,mrs_doubtfire,critics,fresh,p,This comedy's warm and soothing nature will give mainstream audiences in these dysfunctional-family times a perfect holiday uplift.
34,mrs_doubtfire,critics,fresh,p,
35,mrs_doubtfire,critics,fresh,p,The greater story is sacrificed for schticky gags about a guy dressing as an old woman.
36,mrs_doubtfire,critics,fresh,p,"Although overly sappy in places and probably 20 minutes too long, this Robin Williams-in-drag vehicle provides the comic a slick surface for doing his shtick, within a story possessing broad family appeal."
37,mrs_doubtfire,critics,fresh,p,I've rarely laughed so much at a movie I generally disliked.
38,mrs_doubtfire,critics,fresh,p,Modern comedy classic w/Robin Williams in and out of drag.
39,mrs_doubtfire,critics,fresh,p,spectacular
40,mrs_doubtfire,critics,fresh,p,Chris Columbus' only good movie.

49,mrs_doubtfire,critics,fresh,p,One of Robin William's funniest films to date...an absolute beauty!
50,mrs_doubtfire,audience,3.5,p,Feels kind of crude in today's Times and I doubt it would be made in this era...however the film is warming with a good heart and showcases all of the brilliance of Robin Williams talent
51,mrs_doubtfire,audience,4.0,p,The unavoidable attachment to Robin Williams and his family keeps you on your seat waiting to see how the family situation turns out. The tactics employed by Robin Williams to keep in contact with his children are both humorous and affectionate.
52,mrs_doubtfire,audience,5.0,p,Mrs.Doubtfire is Robin Williams finest performance of all time.
53,mrs_doubtfire,audience,5.0,p,HELP IS ON THE WAY DEAR hahahahahah
54,mrs_doubtfire,audience,3.0,p,I do not see how anyone could be happy with this movie!!!
55,mrs_doubtfire,audience,3.5,p,Classic! Sweet story about a family dealing with divorce. It seems like quite a touchy subject but it also has it's funny moments. An easy rewatch. Love Robin Williams' acting
56,mrs_doubtfire,audience,5.0,p,One of William's best! Laughs galore & and a positive look on fatherhood. Recommend to anyone to the whole family
57,mrs_doubtfire,audience,4.0,p,It's really fun. Robin Williams carries the show.
58,mrs_doubtfire,audience,5.0,p,"A touching and hilarious look at the effects of divorce.  Probably the best of the late great Robin Williams, may he rest in peace."
59,mrs_doubtfire,audience,3.5,p,Robin Willems is the best and Pierce Bosman is so good also but who does not love this movie. Is it worth its golden globe maybe?
60,girls_trip,critics,fresh,p,I want at least three more sequels and a series after this.
61,girls_trip,critics,fresh,p,Moviegoers who endured a rough night watching the recent Rough Night will fare significantly better with Girls Trip.
62,girls_trip,critics,fresh,p,"Expect start-to-finish hilarity, of both a sexual and scatological nature."
63,girls_trip,critics,fresh,p,"These grosser gags may put some off, but most will cry with laughter. When these four share the screen, sparks fly and the chemistry is perfect."
64,girls_trip,critics,fresh,p,"It's a raucous ride, unlike anything I've ever seen in theaters."
65,girls_trip,critics,fresh,p,"Girls Trip is clearly not the product of comic actors haphazardly riffing on set until they reach their joke quota. Here, instead, is a movie that feels like having fun with real people."
66,girls_trip,critics,fresh,p,"If you need a good deep belly laugh, this is your movie."
67,girls_trip,critics,fresh,p,A perfect example of a film where the cast truly matters.
68,girls_trip,critics,fresh,p,"A refreshing, charming and often very funny getaway with the girls!"
69,girls_trip,critics,fresh,p,Saucy laughs land rapid fire
70,girls_trip,critics,fresh,p,It was really funny. Go see it.
71,girls_trip,critics,fresh,p,This movie is hilarious.
72,girls_trip,critics,fresh,p,"Girls Trip has an appeal that goes beyond the limp plot devices and superfluous storylines. There's certainly the ""about damn time"" quality that runs through the whole movie, and a great number of the R-rated jokes land."
73,girls_trip,critics,fresh,p,...the bond between the four women - and occasional lack thereof - demands repeat viewing much more than the sporadic shocks of gross-out (and grapefruit) humor.
74,girls_trip,critics,fresh,p,"It's frequently filthy fun that provides countless laughs and all the emotions. There's meaning behind the laughs though, a celebratory message of female friendship that will resonate universally."
75,girls_trip,critics,fresh,p,"It's pretty cool to see a comedy starring black women getting to do all the raunchy, fun humor that usually we see white men do all the time, occasionally black men and that one time we saw white women."
76,girls_trip,critics,fresh,p,This is a film that takes Bridesmaids and Trainwreck up a notch.
77,girls_trip,critics,fresh,p,"Fast, fun and raunchy. I had a blast in this well thought trip to friendship. [Full review in Spanish]."
78,girls_trip,critics,fresh,p,"The film, in both explicit and implicit ways, is a necessary celebration of women as partners and not competitors."
79,girls_trip,critics,fresh,p,Girls Trip accomplishes much thanks to the charisma and chemistry of the four lead actresses.
80,girls_trip,audience,2.0,n,It looks too ethnic for me
81,girls_trip,audience,4.0,p,"Fun flick!  It's an R-rated comedy set in NOLA, of course it's going to be raunchy!  Y'all knew what this is about before you watched it, or should have.  Geez!  This is way better than Bridesmaids."
82,girls_trip,audience,0.5,n,"Wow awful, the fact that this got a 91 percent  is shocking to me, it's garbage"
83,girls_trip,audience,2.0,n,"I am not sure who the audience is.  There is a friendship and romance framework for the ladies, but then the overlay is about as foul-mouthed and awful as any low-rent Seth Rogan flick.  Parts of this movie are touching, and a (very) few parts are funny, but the rest is drinking and partying and trash talking.  That would have been fine had the film been funny.  Or the friendship dynamic would be watchable if they toned down the R-rated stuff.
Not to pick on this movie specifically, but the comedic race to the bottom is starting to make Adam Sandler flicks seem classy ('Little Nicky' excluded)."
84,girls_trip,audience,3.5,p,"Its engaging and entertaining plot, a fresh take on a familiar narrative, compelling characters, excellent cast and outrageous but effective humor make it a modern comedy classic worth watching."
85,girls_trip,audience,4.0,p,I really enjoyed the movie.
86,girls_trip,audience,4.5,p,loved the music scenes ...bourbon street scenes  ... entertaining flik

89,girls_trip,audience,5.0,p,My all time favourite movie! Laughing non stop throughout!
90,ghostbusters,critics,fresh,p,Test.
91,ghostbusters,critics,fresh,p,I also really appreciate that Aykroyd and Ramis' script is so tightly structured but joke dense. There is practically no wasted time in this film.
92,ghostbusters,critics,fresh,p,"It's the thrills of wraith-combating, action-packed citywide devastation, and carefree attitudes that highlight the adventures and give the film a strong sense of originality."
93,ghostbusters,critics,fresh,p,"It is not intended to change anyone's life, just invite you to follow a fun and crazy group. [Full Review in Spanish]"
94,ghostbusters,critics,fresh,p,"Partly because of the cast, partly because of the effects, partly because of Elmer Bernstein's score, and partly because of [Ivan] Reitman's directing style, it all just worked -- and it still does"
95,ghostbusters,critics,fresh,p,"Despite the flaws I've dwelled on here, I feel real affection for Ghostbusters. How could you not? It's goofy, funny, homey - it's genuine comfort food"
96,ghostbusters,critics,fresh,p,...an erratic yet consistently entertaining summer blockbuster...
97,ghostbusters,critics,fresh,p,Ghostbusters is like romping through Disneyland's haunted house with Bill Murray.
98,ghostbusters,critics,fresh,p,"Ghostbusters is primarily a showcase for Murray, who slinks through the movie muttering his lines in his usual cheeky fashion and getting off an occasionally hilarious crack that proves he's thoroughly enjoying himself."
99,ghostbusters,critics,fresh,p,"The plotting may be primitive, but it's all carried off with far more style and finesse than one might expect from the creators of Animal House and Meatballs."
100,ghostbusters,critics,fresh,p,It's almost impossible not to smile while watching it.
101,ghostbusters,critics,fresh,p,Part of the sheer joy of this movie -- aside from the comic timing of Bill Murray -- is the cartoonish crapness of its apparitions and their placid acceptance by the Ghostbusters team.
102,ghostbusters,critics,fresh,p,What you realise about Ghostbusters thirty years on is that Bill Murray is a comedy genius.
103,ghostbusters,critics,fresh,p,"It speaks to its entire audience, without ever seeming to joke over children's heads in a snide or overly knowing manner."
104,ghostbusters,critics,fresh,p,"The elastic structure provides ample room for inspired surrealism, yet the looseness never compromises the film's tongue-in-cheek love letter to pre-gentrification Manhattan or its piercing satire of Reaganite go-getting ..."
105,ghostbusters,critics,fresh,p,"Thirty years later, there are still rumblings of making another sequel, but no one would dare suggest a reboot or re-imagining; Ghostbusters is perfect exactly as it is."
106,ghostbusters,critics,fresh,p,"If you've never experienced GHOSTBUSTERS on the big screen, you really need to go see this. If not I'm afraid you'll have to turn in your geek card."
107,ghostbusters,critics,fresh,p,"On balance, Ghostbusters is a hoot. It's Murray's picture, and in a triumph of mind over matter, he blows away the film's boring special effects with his one-liners."
108,ghostbusters,critics,fresh,p,"A fantasy, but with no touches of reality at all, to be enjoyed for its zany humour typical of the ""National Lampoon"" school from which several of its contributors are drawn."
109,ghostbusters,critics,fresh,p,"Ghostbusters thrives on the fine line between taking it all seriously enough to be scary, then poking fun at it in the most creative ways possible."
110,ghostbusters,audience,5.0,p,"Absolutely brilliant! This movie was the yardstick by which other comedies and science fiction films would be judged against for MANY years to come, after it's June, 1984 release date! So unbelievably popular, it was also responsible for the popular phrase ""who ya gonna call"" to disappear from common parlance, due to the answer always being ""Ghost Busters"" after the film's release. The acting is better than superb, the writing is darn near perfection, and the story is compelling but whimsical and hilarious. This film was so good that the Feig ""all female"" remake would have faced harsh criticism even if it was not terrible in every imaginable way! Seriously one of the best comedy films of the twentieth century, being narrowly beat out of the top spot just FIVE DAYS earlier by Back To The Future… THAT was a great week for history making films!"
111,ghostbusters,audience,4.0,p,"Cute movie, but final boss fight was too short and easy."
112,ghostbusters,audience,3.5,p,"An emotional, action and funny movie."
113,ghostbusters,audience,5.0,p,"I mean, yeah.  Obvs.  Doesn't get better than this."
114,ghostbusters,audience,4.0,p,"If you liked the 1st not the 2nd the 1st, then you will enjoy this."
115,ghostbusters,audience,4.0,p,"Nostalgia pura, una mezcla entre la franquicia vieja, y stranger things que pasa la estafeta de gran manera las nuevas generaciones, dejando un momento de melancolia y homenaje para los antiguos fans"
116,ghostbusters,audience,5.0,p,An absolute classic.  Seen this movie 5 times and its just great every time
117,ghostbusters,audience,5.0,p,What can I say other than this move earned its legend status.
118,ghostbusters,audience,5.0,p,The kids' performances really shine. Afterlife has a lot of heart.
119,ghostbusters,audience,4.0,p,Loved it! Classic movie
120,bringing_up_baby,critics,fresh,p,Grant... sails through the film's slapstick with breathtaking panache - only a supremely graceful actor could perform clumsiness so skilfully or amusingly.
121,bringing_up_baby,critics,fresh,p,"It is, to put it bluntly, the perfect screwball comedy, a rapid-fire barrage of ludicrous mayhem whose absurdity only gets funnier as it goes along, thanks in huge part to the game dedication of its cast."
122,bringing_up_baby,critics,fresh,p,"Thanks to the efforts of both Hepburn and Grant, Bringing Up Baby is one of the best screwball comedies of all time."
123,bringing_up_baby,critics,fresh,p,One of those movies that seems to improve upon repeat viewings.
124,bringing_up_baby,critics,fresh,p,"Indeed, it's her chemistry with Grant which makes for such a wonderful spectacle. Hawks ensures that the pair lurch from one debacle to another."
125,bringing_up_baby,critics,fresh,p,"The story is twisty and plenty silly, but the comic chemistry, between the leads, and also the side players, many of whom from the Vaudeville circuit, makes even the most tumultuous encounters run smooth as a gear box."
126,bringing_up_baby,critics,fresh,p,"Grant and Hepburn compose a dazzlingly energetic couple, playing off each other's polar-opposite personalities with impressive cinematic flair."
127,bringing_up_baby,critics,fresh,p,"Original, freeform and timeless."
128,bringing_up_baby,critics,fresh,p,Preposterous but fairly amusing.
129,bringing_up_baby,critics,rotten,n,"It seems that almost any star, including Irene Dunne, Carole Lombard and Myrna Loy, may attempt antic comedy and make a go of it, but that medium is not for Miss Hepburn in the theater where she is accepted as an important dramatic actress."
130,bringing_up_baby,critics,fresh,p,"[VIDEO ESSAY] Howard Hawks's ""Bringing Up Baby"" is the go-to example of screwball comedy that critics and film-lovers reference most as the definitive model of the genre."
131,bringing_up_baby,critics,fresh,p,"Howard Hawks's classic took the screwball cycle started by It Happened One Night to its dizzying, dazzling peak."
132,bringing_up_baby,critics,fresh,p,How sublime can movies get?
133,bringing_up_baby,critics,fresh,p,The enduring fascination of this 1938 screwball comedy is due to much more than its uproarious gags.
134,bringing_up_baby,critics,fresh,p,Bringing Up Baby's narrative and thematic directions have much in common with those of Shakespearean comedy.
135,bringing_up_baby,critics,fresh,p,A perfect example of why directors (and even us brilliant professional critics) can often be completely in the dark about what works.
136,bringing_up_baby,critics,fresh,p,"Classic screwball comedy stars Hepburn, Grant."
137,bringing_up_baby,critics,fresh,p,Grant plays the timid Dr. David Huxley with the proper restraint and tics.
138,bringing_up_baby,critics,fresh,p,"Grant e Hepburn estabelecem uma ótima dinâmica e revelam um impecável timing cômico, mas nem mesmo o ritmo invejável da narrativa consegue ocultar o fato de que algumas de suas principais gags envelheceram mal."
139,bringing_up_baby,critics,fresh,p,"There is little rhyme or reason to most of the action, but it's all highly palatable."
140,bringing_up_baby,audience,5.0,p,"Arguably the greatest (and funniest and fastest) comedy ever made, for certain the ultimate screwball comedy, never surpassed in its madcap culmination of absurd and hilarious misadventures; with a perfect cast (Skippy and Nissa included) and the chemistry between Hepburn and Grant is breathtakingly immaculate."
141,bringing_up_baby,audience,5.0,p,A screwball comedy that is an absolute delight. I never lost a grin on my face throughout the whole film.
142,bringing_up_baby,audience,4.5,p,"Yes, this is a crazy screwball comedy, but it works.

A nerdy college professor is finally about to receive a missing bone for his brontosaurus skeleton in his museum. He also is about to marry a woman who is more interested in his work than in him as a person. On top of that, he has to get in good with a lawyer who represents a society matron who has $! million to give away...hopefully to his museum. Trouble is, a spoiled rich woman keeps getting in his way and interfering with his plans. And the woman even has problems of her own...what is she supposed to do with a tamed leopard (the ""Baby"" of the title) her brother just sent her? And the professor gets unwillingly involved.

This is a clearly not intended to be realistic, but a comedy of errors a la Shakespeare. Old-fashioned without being dated, and family entertainment with enough spice (such as a torn skirt scene) to prevent it from being insipid. Great light entertainment!"
143,bringing_up_baby,audience,5.0,p,"One of the funniest movies of all time. An absolute gem of a screwball comedy. Truly brilliant work by the incredibly beautiful and ravishing Katharine Hepburn, the truly great comic actor Cary Grant, and the master of screwball comedy Howard hawks.

Funnier every time I see it -- and that must be at least 50 times, with surely many more to come.

One of my truly favorite movies of all time!!"
144,bringing_up_baby,audience,0.5,n,"Atrocious. I know this is supposed to be a classic, but the great Katharine Hepburn plays an insipid, manipulative twit. The plot is inane. The whole thing is shill. Don't waste your time unless you want to watch a lot of morons scream at each other."
145,bringing_up_baby,audience,5.0,p,"Bringing Up Baby - 10/10. Howard Hawks, Cary Grant, and Katherine Hepburn are some of the biggest and most successful people from the Golden age of Hollywood. Though each person had amazing careers later on after this film, Bringing Up Baby is a perfect example of a film that was well ahead of its time, and once it was appreciated, was considered as a masterpiece in its respective genre. The movie is probably the first film in the now super popular screwball comedy genre. Back when it came out in 1938, the film bombed at the box office, and even lead to having Hepburn losing out on film roles because of its unsuccessful initial run. But the film gained a better reputation as the film started playing on television in the 50s. Many films of today can learn a thing or two in the way the comedy is presented and delivered in this film. Grant and Hepburn play up the odd couple dynamic really well, with Grant's uptight nature and Hepburn's bubbly mannerisms helping bring a nice levity to the proceedings. The movie is littered with zany moments which feel over the top in the right way. What a lot of comedies do nowadays is try to make shocking moments that are so ridiculous, yet this film understands the perfect balance of zany and natural humour. Hawks provides the viewer with a quick and fast movie which translates really well all these years later. You're aware of it being a classic film, but it doesn't feel that way in the slightest. Time just flies by watching the movie, and its just a really fun time overall. Hopefully the movie never ever is remade, because I highly doubt anyone can top the performances that the whole cast gives in the film."

Although the films become more perfunctory, even American Reunion (2012) sticks to the values of the original, and has you genuinely enjoying the characters company all those years later.

200,being_there,audience,4.0,p,"Before Forrest Gump used a similar premise for a more nostalgic and less subtle take on the same general character (a well-intentioned but slow protagonist that indirectly lampoons society around him through a serious of tremendously benevolent misunderstandings), Chauncey Gardiner made the world laugh and suffer from crippling secondary embarassment simultaneously. While very much a comedy of manners, Being There becomes a full-on satire of modern culture, media, pseudointellectualism, and personality, largely by letting Gardiner's very literal remarks linger in the air before being carefully misconstrued as worldly wisdom, with each slip-up seeming to spell his inevitable downfall but ultimately only reinforcing the perception of guarded knowledge. The film remains a poignant reflection on the myth of the meritocracy in modern society, taking even an intermittent stance on race that still seems biting. 

Sellers' performance in Being There is absolutely towering, demonstrating that even decades after he had experienced the height of his popularity there was a reason for his initial rise. Most notably, the characterization of Gardiner makes use of Sellers' particular penchant for physical comedy but absolutely doesn't overtly rely on it - it's a demonstration of the accomplished comedian's true acting chops that sells the character. I like Dustin Hoffman in Kramer vs. Kramer as much as the next guy, but if you're considering the actual performances, it's hard to say that a comparison between him and Sellers in Being There doesn't lean heavily towards the latter; everything in this character is designed from the ground up with a purpose. (4/5)"
201,being_there,audience,5.0,p,"Brilliant satire from the master Hal Ashby!

Director Hal Ashby's comedy Being There (1979) is a blast to watch and it just gets funnier and more ridiculous as it goes along to its resplendent conclusion. I was smiling, laughing, and thinking the entire time as Ashby splices together 70's pop culture and politics with a sly absurdism over how tumultuous these times were for America. Johnny Mandel's score even captures the strangeness of this era with his opening funk remix of Also Sprach Zarathustra.

I appreciated the lush sets with such meticulous lavishness from the production designer Michael D. Haller. May Routh's costumes are gorgeous on the lovely Shirley MacLaine, who is hilarious as the kind hearted and super horny Eve Rand. MacLaine is a pleasure to watch her flirt with Peter Sellers and find a poignant heartfelt realness towards her love. It's also cool to see director Hal Ashby even cameo in the movie later on as the man by the cabinet at the newspaper The Washington Post.

Caleb Deschanel's cinematography captures all these cute wide shots and a mesmerizing final shot of Peter Sellers walking on water with all his blissful ignorance, light as air. Being There is gorgeously shot. Don Zimmerman's editing is sharp and gently allows Being There to walk steadily to its pleasant absurdities for a quickly paced 130 minutes. The way Zimmerman cuts together 70's television into these outrageous montages is simply sublime as you get to see all the imagery and entertainment that Chance the gardener sees.

Writers Jerzy Kosinski and Robert C. Jones finds the laughter out of obtuse, ignorant, rich conservatives who unknowingly take in a now homeless gardener played by Peter Sellers. Being There is a clever satire of 1970's conservative policies, government lobbying, presidential influence from special interests, racial dynamics, television as education, economics disparity, and American ego. 

Hal Ashby shows how people only hear what they want to hear from Peter Sellers' simple minded gardener Chance because of their own narcissism and ego. He has no idea about what anyone is talking about in Being There, yet his words apply to everything in a hilarious display of good humor from Sellers and Ashby. Their words bring Ashby's striking satire to a warm and funny life of its own. Being There is certainly one of Hal Ashby's greatest films, if not his best picture.

Peter Sellers beautifully portrays a man named Chance who stumbles through life with a dependence on the kindness of strangers as Blanche Dubois said, because he's mentally a still a child. Sellers delivers a heartfelt and nuanced performance that really captures the chaos of the 1970's both economically and politically with a more reserved acting than you're probably used to seeing from the famous comedian. He's hilarious as the straight man as everyone else is just crazy to talk to Chance, who they never really understand as Being There is a comedy of errors because Chance is so vague, everyone he speaks to hears whatever they want out of his meaningless dialogue.

Jack Warden's foolish Republican President Bobby is a clear stand in for the Gerald Fords and Richard Nixons of America with his need for conservative advice, idiotic manner, and strange paranoia. I enjoyed Melvyn Douglas' totally sincere performance as the conservative lobbyist and special interests millionaire investor Ben Rand. He feels as much Kissinger as a Dick Cheney type in hindsight. 

Richard Dysart is funny as Dr. Robert Allenby, who is the only man to understand who Chance really is in reality. You totally see how conspiracies, espionage, and paranoia grow as every intelligence agency and country wants to know who Chance is, but it takes the sole observant man to get Peter Sellers' silly normal man. Ruth Attaway's maid Louise sums up how only a white man could get by being illiterate and idiotic and still thrive in America.

In short, Being There sees Peter Sellers saying little, while Hal Ashby's film speaks volume on America's broken economic inequality and corrupt political system."
202,being_there,audience,3.0,p,"Being There is an amusing anecdote that goes on a little too long. Yes, we understand that people mistake Chance's simple-mindedness for genius, but do we really need to show that for over two hours? This deliberately slow-paced story received a lot of praise, and while Peter Seller's performance is engaging & unique, I didn't find this film to be quite as brilliant as others perceive it to be."
203,being_there,audience,1.5,n,"Excruciatingly slow and painfully lacking in entertainment value. There must have been nothing better to watch in the 80s. If I wanted to watch a grown autistic man have awkward interactions with people around him I would have gone to my local special ed school. And still I wouldn't be laughing. There is nothing remarkable about this lazy performance and film.

205,being_there,audience,4.5,p,"Director Hal Ashby had an unparalleled run of wildly successful films during the 70s, culminating with what was arguably his masterpiece, Being There.  With a screenplay by Jerzy Kosinski based on his own novel, the film stars Peter Sellers as Chance the Gardener (or Chauncey Gardiner), an intellectually challenged man who relates to the world by using what he has learned from watching television and working in the garden.  He is eventually adopted as an unofficial advisor to Washington's political elite, including the President, who see him as an intellectual with astute, albeit cryptic, views on the world.  Sellers gives a brilliant performance, the satire is biting, and Ashby cements his standing as one of America's great (but underappreciated) directors."

207,being_there,audience,5.0,p,"Being There is a rare movie. It is a gem that gets a lot of attention upon its release, then gets forgotten for many years, and then hollowed out of its temorary grave. I am so glad I came across this film on DVD after so many years. This movie is remembered as Peter Sellers' swan song, where he gave the performance of a lifetime. The plot is aptly a simple one; after the death of his employer, naive Chance has to leave the house where he lived since he was young. With limited knowledge of the outside world, only knowing what he has seen on TV and gardening, he is released into the cruel and relentless world. Fortunately for him, he gets involved in an accident with sickly businessman Ben Rant (an Oscar winning performance by veteran Melvyn Douglas) and his wife (Shirley McLaine) and they decide to let him live in their mansion. The Rants mistakenly think Chance is an influential politician (confusing his name with Chauncey Gardiner), since they construe his utterances and gardening tips as a profound, sophisticated critique of politics, economy, existentialism and the overall state of human existence. He climbs up the stairs of success to the point where he is bound to be chosen as an official presidential candidate. Then suddenly, he vanishes in a Christlike manner. Our simple minded Chance however, cannot seem to understand his position and does not really want to. All he needs is a caring home, a television and a garden to take care of. The novel of the same name by Jerzy Kosinski was a labor of love for Sellers, who adored the central character. After the novel's release, he sent the author a telegram saying ""AVAILABLE IN MY GARDEN OR OUTSIDE OF IT"". That explains the film's success. Peter Sellers, the chameleon actor, absolutely nailed the role of Chance, giving a superb performance worthy of an Oscar (unfortunately he lost to an equally good Dustin Hoffmann). Along with Sellers' unique and somehow sad performance, the film is driven by Hal Ashby, an exquisite director who is responsible for many thought provoking and bizarre films like Harold and Maude. Instead of making the film a clumsy story based on human guillibility and stupidity, he benefits from an incredible screenplay and gives the film a slow, winter like, melancholic pace. The supporting cast does an excellent job as well,  the score (Based on Erik Satie's Gnossiennes 4 and 6) is haunting and memorable to say the least and the cinematography is out of this world. All of these factors work together and create a very bitter and sharp comedy drama, whose themes are so profound and well presented that i highly recommend watching this one and exploring those yourself. I like to watch..."

The acting was superb and this film has really stood the test of time and harnessed the late 1970's excellently. Must watch classic."

In a time where horror parody movies weren't that well received, Shaun of the Dead (2004) surprised everyone, thanks to Edgar Wright's direction and his hilarious cast. From a parody film you obvious expect nods to aspects from other films as well as humour, however Edgar Wright goes out of his way to contain much more quality. At the centre of the film the story is shown to be that many people already live like zombies as they are stuck in a day-to-day routine and that when a zombie outbreak strikes, it isn't noticeable at first. Before the outbreak strikes plenty of lines and actions within the film are established and foreshadow what is to come, allowing for certain callbacks post-outbreak which are highlighted in a different way thanks to the events that have taken place.

Shaun of the Dead (2004) is more than a great horror comedy, it is one of the best comedies in general, thanks to the continuously great chemistry and relationship of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost which is a recurring theme in Edgar Wright films. The story is funny yet emotional, making for nothing short of an entertaining watch."
21,shaun_of_the_dead,audience,5.0,p,"An absolutely hilarious film that doesn't hold back, ""Shaun of the Dead"" is perhaps Edgar Wright's best film ever made, having extremely memorable lines and characters with a flawlessly funny story. The entire movie is absurd, depicting events handled in the goofiest ways possible, which makes the entire film insanely hilarious. The story is great, and the ending is pretty emotional. The action and CGI are done very well for its time. Overall, just a fun movie from start to finish with no flaws other than it might not be to everyone's taste."

61,fast_times_at_ridgemont_high,critics,fresh,p,...an erratic yet ultimately rewarding endeavor that deserves a place among Hollywood's very best high-school movies.

It really does paint a picture of those awesome days being young and coming of age.  It's kind of sad now seeing the malls deserted as everything has moved online.  Back then, you could go and you'd see all your friends.  The issues taken on by this movie are timeless and are still relevant to this day.  Two thumbs up from me!"
81,fast_times_at_ridgemont_high,audience,5.0,p,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIES
82,fast_times_at_ridgemont_high,audience,4.5,p,"Fast Times At Ridgemont High is a fantastic teen comedy that became the archetype for the genre in the ‘80s. Crowe's script eschews the juvenile raunch of the decade for something deeper, more balanced, and moving. Within its short 90-minute runtime, Heckerling seamlessly creates characters that are real and relatable. It captures everything teenagers experience, the good, the bad, and the consequences of such actions. To quote Spicoli, Fast Times at Ridgemont High is ""awesome! Totally awesome!"""
83,fast_times_at_ridgemont_high,audience,4.0,p,"This was one of the first movies on my watchlist when I decided to take a tour of the 80s to watch most of the movies whose names I've heard of but I'd never seen before. Between watching this and writing the review I've come to realize that ""slice of life"" was apparently a big fad for this decade as there's no real three-act structure in this and it threw me off when I watched it, but now I've seen 3 or 4 more movies with a similar premise of just watching some high school kids grow up in a jumbled way that doesn't necessarily tell a specific story and can happily say that this was better than any of the Brat Pack ones I saw, hands down. The sex scene was surprisingly gratuitous but using abortion as a tone-adjustment was a nice touch, the individual performances were as excellent as everyone said they would be and the characters were interesting even though they didn't receive particularly good arcs as the movie went on. The music was good too."
84,fast_times_at_ridgemont_high,audience,5.0,p,One of the all time greats. Never gets old.
85,fast_times_at_ridgemont_high,audience,3.0,p,"""Whenever possible, put on Side One of Led Zeppelin IV.""

As someone who grew up at a time when the mall was already in a period of steep decline, there's definitely something of a generational gap when it comes to Fast Times, but there's also plenty to relate to in the diverse depictions of obsessions, inexperience, and social interactions that make up an entirely self-contained world (nowhere but high school will you find so many life-or-death scenarios that won't matter five years later). It's easy to take potshots at a film that lacks anything resembling a central narrative and is more a series of vignettes of colorful characters (Sean Penn's surfer bro Spicoli is considered the film's star and one of the most memorable characters, but hardly interacts with any of the other protagonists), but then you take a step back and realize that a form like this is really more reminiscent of the genuine high school experience; people traveling in their own cliques that occasionally are brought together by the odd class or guy-that-knows-a-guy. And as an added bonus, the film never gets dull by focusing on one part for too long. 

One aspect that really stands out in Fast Times is just how damn horny the film is, particularly the first half. I get that hormones are raging at this time in everyone's life, but damn, were the '80s just filled with denim-clad ass and pregnancy scares? At the same time, you can't knock the film too hard because there's a surprising amount of complexity and candor to the awkward, fumbling interactions, and the reflective dialogue between friends that give the film an entirely new take on a generation whose parents were Boomers taking their steady gal down to the malt shop before going for a kiss on the fourth date.

One of those movies that has left enough of an impression on popular culture where it still inspires a sense of name recognition even among those who haven't seen it, but hasn't crossed into the territory of 'necessary viewing' in the way that other teen classics like Ferris Bueller or Dazed and Confused have. Maybe it's the occasional nudity? (3/5)"
86,fast_times_at_ridgemont_high,audience,3.0,p,"It's taken me an age to watch this for the first time, for someone who claims to like a high school drama. Amy Heckerling's teen flick shows all the ingredients that she would combine to create her ne plus ultra thirteen years later in Clueless (1995). It's also Caemron Crowe's writing debut, the man who went on to write both brilliant and insufferable scripts, but he's on form here. Fast Times is scratchy, patchy, questionable, but it has a good heart, and it's an important film in the high school pantheon, with a notoriously hilarious early performance from Sean Penn."
87,fast_times_at_ridgemont_high,audience,4.5,p,"Funny and touching so many issues, this film deserves the title of cult film. I had never seen it before and I was laughing and thinking all along. Acted brilliantly by newbies that proved their mettle over the years. Even small roles were given to now stars."
88,fast_times_at_ridgemont_high,audience,3.0,p,"If you take Big Mouth, but discard all of its insight about the teenage sexual experience, you would get Fast Times at Ridgemont High – a movie that has a very funny Sean Penn turn, a solid soundtrack and fine humor, but lacks sophistication, its treatment of girls felt sexist, plus the characterization was quite weak. It's a very dated coming-of-age flick."
89,fast_times_at_ridgemont_high,audience,5.0,p,Some phenomenal actors when they were young. As memorable as movie's get. Cult classic for good reasons.
90,in_the_loop,critics,fresh,p,"For all those still seething over the cynical manipulation and mendacity behind Bush and Blair's rush to war in Iraq, Armando Iannucci's blistering political satire In the Loop offers a measure of catharsis."
91,in_the_loop,critics,fresh,p,Hilarious political satire has very strong language.
92,in_the_loop,critics,fresh,p,This almost unconscionably hilarious black satire imagining the behind-the-scene mishaps leading up to the Iraqi invasion plays like a latter-day Dr. Strangelove.
93,in_the_loop,critics,fresh,p,"Possessing boundless cynicism, this caustic satire might not be for everyone but not a single performer's comic timing is off."
94,in_the_loop,critics,fresh,p,"Not only is In the Loop one of the funniest things you'll see this year, but it's also one of the most intelligent pieces of British satire for some time."
95,in_the_loop,critics,fresh,p,"A wicked, mean-spirited comedy filled with nasty people...I haven't laughed this hard in a long time."
96,in_the_loop,critics,fresh,p,"Finally, fa-HINE-ally, someone has made a proper comedy. Armando Iannucci, to be exact, with In the Loop, his annihilating satire of recent Anglo-American misadventures in the Middle East."
97,in_the_loop,critics,fresh,p,"You probably wouldn't want to spend three hours listening to Alan Partridge's drive-time radio broadcast, but this idiotic DJ delivers a solid 90 minutes of cinematic entertainment."

99,in_the_loop,critics,rotten,n,"This alleged satire, which received four-star treatment from other critics, left me with a ho-hum and sorry feeling that I had wasted an evening seeing it."
100,in_the_loop,critics,fresh,p,"Some have found In the Loop shallow for detaching its fevered gamesmanship from actual reasoning or consequences -- but isn't it rather chilling, how easy it is for the loop to form in a vacuum?"

107,in_the_loop,critics,fresh,p,"The War Room has been replaced by drably decorated offices, insane army generals have been replaced by eerily sensible ones, and the man with the most power is not the POTUS but instead a PR-man with a filthy mouth."
108,in_the_loop,critics,fresh,p,"Not since ""Three Kings"" has war satire felt as gloriously agitated and acerbic. Brimming with ""The Office's"" British-born briskness, Armando Ianucci's film doles out diabolical wit and depressing truths about corrosive careerism and boomeranging policies."
109,in_the_loop,critics,fresh,p,"Peter Capaldi chews himself great big chunks of scenery in a role some might think over the top, but having worked with tyrants like this in the past, I thought was moderate to restrained."
110,in_the_loop,audience,3.0,p,"Big fan of the TV series this movie is based on (The Thick of It). This movie felt like a step down. Bigger budget, better camera's, some higher profile actors, yet all that doesn't translate into a movie that is better or even rivals the TV series.

Capaldi as Tucker is of course the highlight, swearing and spinning as only he can. Rehashing the other characters, especially Ollie and Glen is just unforgivable, and the American cast members don't add anything. 

On itself probably not as bad, but when you're a fan of the TV series this is based on, or spun off, it just doesn't cut the mustard."
111,in_the_loop,audience,3.5,p,"I'm currently watching The Thick of It, so I wanted to check out this movie, which is essentially an alternate universe version of that show with a slightly bigger budget, and where part of it takes place in America. Peter Capaldi is great as Malcom Tucker, as he is in the show, and the various supporting characters all have their charm. Overall though, I didn't think the story was the best I've seen from this format."
112,in_the_loop,audience,4.0,p,"This is comedy at its best on the bigscreen when it comes to political/nationalist, anti-war, hand-greasing, ass-kissing satire.
The cast is bonkers. Capaldi owns nearly every scene he's in, delivering bone-crushing, spot-on lines of utter disdain and dismissal all in that Scottish accent.
Hollander kills it as the fancy boy weakling figure Simon. Great jobs also by Gina McKee, Mimi Kennedy, and the very reliable anna Chlumsky on the ladies side. 
Toss in Chris Addison, Gandolfini, and holy crap, Steve Coogan, and it's gotta be at least ok. But the team of writers on this one were on the mark so often with the funny. And director Iannucci keeps the pace up throughout, with only the last 10 min. or so floundering some. Check this one out, folks. That is, if you're not put off my extreme verbal assaults and people making asses of themselves. 4 stars"
113,in_the_loop,audience,2.0,n,Attempted Brutish rubbishing humor that works 20% of the time.  Overall the black comedy was just gray.
114,in_the_loop,audience,4.0,p,"It's good, mainly carried by Capaldi's ingenious obscenities but some other funny set pieces along the way too. Unusual to see good gags throughout."
115,in_the_loop,audience,5.0,p,Hysterically funny no matter how many times I watch it.
116,in_the_loop,audience,4.5,p,"When I first watched #InTheLoop, I had no idea it was a spin-off of a series called The Thick of It. I enjoyed it so much, I watched the entire series and then watched this again and enjoyed it even more. 

Armando Iannucci returns with his big-brain writing after the rousing outing with The Thick of It and goes further in this movie by not only satirizing the British Government but giving you a view of the other side of the pond, the USA, as well as including a U.N plot thread. All of it just ups the stakes, ups the craziness, ups the hilarity and the social commentary and dark undertones propelling it even beyond the series in a film sized package. 

There are new heavy hitters such as Tom Hollander and James Gandolfini, who do a wonderful job along with the rest of the cast. But it is the angry Scotsmen that steal the show for me yet again. Peter Capaldi as Malcolm Tucker and Paul Higgins as Jamie MacDonald, terrorizing the British Government from within and keeping the sheep in order, oh what an experience it was seeing their performance coupled with the amazing writing. Pure bliss. 

Tightly paced, well shot and scored, directed yet again as you're a fly on the wall experiencing this, the runtime flies by. 

Ultimately, I loved this film. I'd suggest watching this and the series if you have any interest in this type of comedy and satire. Hell, even if you don't, I'd still say give it a try, it's so well written, might still enjoy it. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 9.5/10."
117,in_the_loop,audience,3.0,p,"In the Loop feels like a movie length sitcom episode, which I gather is exactly what it is. Some great comic talent and some laugh-out-loud moments, but the story doesn't evolve much over the course of the film."
118,in_the_loop,audience,3.0,p,"I've watched a few episodes of In the Thick of It, and although I was never compelled to finish the series Iannucci impressed me enough in The Death of Stalin to warrant giving this one a go. The main result was simply indifference on my part. The dialogue is snappy and the scenarios entertaining, but the characters never jumped off of the screen to force me to care at all about proceedings. For those more interested in the political genre, this would probably be a classic. As it is, I found it forgetful.

Peter Capaldi is good as a profane, Scottish political advisor, but he's simply a machine chugging out constant cleverly-worded insults (in my eyes, at least). He very much encapsulates everything well-worked about the film, yet also unexpectedly vacuous."
119,in_the_loop,audience,5.0,p,"Brilliant, you must have a tolerance for colorful metaphors but if you do, it is a must see."
120,all_about_my_mother,critics,fresh,p,"Arguably the best ever film by visionary Pedro Almodóvar, this heartfelt comedy drama is a celebration of womanhood and maternity which also explores - with tender sensitivity - the trials and tribulations of LGBTQ+ life."
121,all_about_my_mother,critics,fresh,p,"On paper, it features a plot which sounds like the soapiest of Sirk mixed with the most lurid of telenovela and yet, as a testament to the writer/director's mastery, it's a vividly joyful odyssey of fluctuating emotional tones."
122,all_about_my_mother,critics,fresh,p,"...this melodramatic narrative, in the end, is a satisfying story about femininity and companionship. Arguably one of Almodóvar's masterpieces..."
123,all_about_my_mother,critics,fresh,p,"For all the film's purple prose and soap opera dramatics, Almodóvar never loses sight of his characters' simple humanity."
124,all_about_my_mother,critics,fresh,p,Almodóvar arguably reached his humanistic peak with this deeply satisfying comedy-drama.
125,all_about_my_mother,critics,fresh,p,"Pedro Almodóvar's winking, melodramatic love note to actresses, Tennessee Williams, and Barcelona is one of those movies that balances the sad and joyful in just the right proportion."
126,all_about_my_mother,critics,fresh,p,This is humanism in drag: Almodovar's passionate redefinition of family values.
127,all_about_my_mother,critics,fresh,p,"It's the film we, Almodvar's faithful fans, have been waiting for, the film we knew he had, as they say, in him."
128,all_about_my_mother,critics,fresh,p,"Thought-provoking Almodovar drama has lots of sex, profanity"
129,all_about_my_mother,critics,fresh,p,Almodvar is able to speak through this melodrama with great mastery to all women... and all audiences for that matter. [Full review in Spanish]
130,all_about_my_mother,critics,fresh,p,"...about the ability of melodrama to speak to, and rise from, our mundane lives."
131,all_about_my_mother,critics,fresh,p,This film is as close to a masterpiece as the director has ever produced.
132,all_about_my_mother,critics,fresh,p,"Hits a number of the right emotional buttons, due in large part to Roth's extraordinary performance."
133,all_about_my_mother,critics,fresh,p,"Like Almodovar's first masterpiece, Women on the Verge of Nervous Breakdown, this vivid melodrama, the auteur's second masterwork, celebrates the resilience and camaraderie of women under duress."
134,all_about_my_mother,critics,fresh,p,It brims with life.
135,all_about_my_mother,critics,fresh,p,It's a lovely work.
136,all_about_my_mother,critics,fresh,p,An emotionally satisfying and brilliantly played take on the ups and (mostly) downs of a group of less-than-typical female friends.
137,all_about_my_mother,critics,rotten,n,For me it felt like a good many weeks at a politically correct summer camp.
138,all_about_my_mother,critics,fresh,p,"All About My Mother is a wonderful Mother's Day card, in any language."
139,all_about_my_mother,critics,fresh,p,"All About My Mother, for all its self-deconstruction, is played with more sobriety and conviction than any of Mr. Almodvar's previous films."

141,all_about_my_mother,audience,3.5,p,"Commedia frutto della mente geniale di Pedro Almodovar in grado di parlare e raccontare con una schiettezza ed una sincerità devastante il tema della sessualità.
Mai si era visto un affronto tale alla classica esposizione di certi temi sul grande schermo, e questo è un pregio invidiabile.
Per quanto riguarda il resto, ogni tanto si scorre via troppo velocemente e con passaggi un poco troppo bizzarri."
142,all_about_my_mother,audience,4.5,p,"Relying on its melodramatic strength, affectingly poignant score and sumptuous colour palette, the movie goes full force right off the bat towards its core concept driving the story forward, relentlessly pulling at heartstrings and leaving us completely choked up. Then, it seems to abandon what it set up and liberates itself, only to unveil, little by little, its rich and intricate tapestry of femininity and maternity. Through a growing web of female characters, All About My Mother celebrates female solidarity as we see each one shows right in time to rescue the other from the brink of collapse by creating emotional bonds between one another to fill in each other's gaps and get each others to complement their missing halves. Stupendous performances from all around, but I was struck, in particular, by Cecilia Roth's bravura performance as the lead character Manuela. The emotional range she shows is impressive and the entire movie she seems as if her eyes locked in tears, ready to fall anytime her son is brought up in any conversation. These scenes show how inextricably linked her complex feelings of haunting grief are, as she mourns Esteban's death and her being bereft of maternity at the same time. All About My Mother is also a panorama of vivid colours and moments of 'joie de vivre' that keep the film light on its feet while bolstering its tribute to actresses as well as its female spirit. Crazy how All About My Mother winds up giving perfect closure to the relationships between the characters and the themes it explores after getting carried away a bit too far now and then."
143,all_about_my_mother,audience,3.5,p,"This was probably the most LGBT-friendly movie I've ever seen and I'm glad to have watched it. The acting was top-notch, particularly from the lesser-known Cecilia Roth & Marisa Paredes, who I'd never heard of before but were very effective conveying their intended emotions. The subject matter was excellent, the sympathetic treatment given to the trans characters was awesome and the allusions to All About Eve were appreciable. I did have some trouble with the subtitles, not because I wasn't paying attention but because HBO Max puts them in tiny un-adjustable font with a non-opaque background that made it nearly impossible to follow along when anything on the screen was white, like the hospital scenes & a few others. It was still a good viewing experience and clearly a great movie!"
144,all_about_my_mother,audience,4.0,p,"A tapestry of femininity that's more like a quilt, vibrant colors and all, to warm your spirit. Inspired by classic melodrama and theatre, but Almodovar does his own thing and offers his own insights, even if some feel a bit too obvious."
145,all_about_my_mother,audience,4.0,p,"In Pedro Almodovar's intimate and insightful salute to femininity, All About My Mother features a cast of fully realized female characters (with a transvestite thrown in for good measure) who struggle to support each other, deal with their individual regrets, and come to terms with missed opportunities.  While the film almost feels too short to deal in depth with all of the intriguing characters, it remains a touching comment on the importance of compassion and acceptance.  The movie, consisting mostly of interior shots, is also vibrant and visually stunning with a color palette unlike any other film of its kind."
146,all_about_my_mother,audience,2.5,n,"1001 movies to see before you die.  A life Feminine drama based in Spain that covers issues like transvestites, aids, child birth and death.  It was well made, but ambiguous.  Saw it on TCM."
147,all_about_my_mother,audience,5.0,p,"Pedro Almodóvar's luscious, poignant, and humane film All About My Mother; sits as a vibrant ode to the classic women-led melodramatic films which flourished within the male-dominated period of Hollywood cinema. Though its connected nature works as a stylistic choice, the film still manages to ""wear it all on its sleeve."" The female characters in All About My Mother not only have individual agency but also come together within a series of life-affirming circumstances like bonding, identity, loss, and grief -- all brought visually to life by Almodóvar. His early filmography including Labyrinth of Passion (Almodóvar, 1982), Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (Almodóvar, 1988) and Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! (Almodóvar, 1990) tended to explore sexuality, drama, pop décor, and were all directed with a visually distinctive approach by their director. 

However, in comparison, Almodóvar's most celebrated Oscar-winning feature acts as a mature steppingstone in his work. He approaches his subjects and themes previously with an almost comical sense of anarchy, which overall passes here for a reflective piece. The characters registered in Almodóvar's unique mind are relatable, caring, flawed, powerful, but still delightfully quirky and real within the space of the film. The film begins with the central protagonist Manuela (Roth). She loses her son, Esteban (Azorín) in a tragic car accident after chasing down a taxi containing famed actress, Huma (Paredes) aiming to get her autograph after watching her in a stage play of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire. Subsequently, after the transplant of her son's heart, Manuela falls apart, leaving prostitution to find his estranged, trans father, Lola (Cantó). Along the way she reconnects with an old friend, another transgender prostitute named Agrado (Juan) and, Rosa (Cruz). Rosa, a Nun whose role is to shelter sex workers and has a crucial connection to Lola, and also to the actress Huma. Her story unfolds like that of a troubled friend to her co-star Nina (Peña) who has a dependency on heroin. 

All the character strands that connect with Manuela work not only as a character drama but as a textual drama as well; the visual references to A Streetcar Named Desire, Manuela and Esteban sitting down to watch All About Eve (Mankiewicz, 1950) and its main story arc, evokes that heavily. Manuela relies on the kindness of friends and strangers, and they return this in turn too. Almodóvar approaches the material with his emphatic and visceral directorial hand but allows these central characters to equally be funny and thought-provoking. It is primarily a caring film that actively refuses to pass judgement on these human frailties or view their consequences as cautionary tales but rather treats them with compassion. The character of Agrado, a transgender former truck driver-turned sex worker, is not solely defined here by her circumstances. Instead, Agrado sets out to deconstruct the prejudiced viewpoints of trans-identity, embracing the things which define her alone instead of by typically preconceived notions; a contemporary and daring feat of trans-positive identity representation by Almodóvar.

Also, an actress that possesses comic chops that can rival that of the classic comedy stars like Gilda Radnor or Madeline Kahn. In a career-defining performance, Penelope Cruz's Rosa, who becomes HIV positive after a relationship with Manuela's former lover Lola – sees within Manuela, Agrado, and Huma, their humanity, and gains happiness in their respective companies.
Almodóvar is showcased here as a director who has reached a peak of emotional heights. In a career that constructed film stories and featured subject matters which are tonally archaic, frank and button-pushing. All About My Mother wants its audience, to listen, to take in and to fully experience these characters occupying a space which feels authentic and true. It is a film that takes its time, relishes, and acknowledges its classic Hollywood genre label, but importantly, Almodóvar has his particular voice to register. Within the movie works of Bette Davis, Huma considers her an inspiration; and it is Almodóvar that clearly wishes not only to utilise and celebrate her wide and appreciated body of work but also, in turn, homage, pastiche and embrace it together via this role. 

An emotional, heartfelt, and sumptuously designed piece of pure melodrama in the best sense. While we are all currently enduring a timely period of political divide and intolerance, the works of Spain's most appealing, enduring and above all graceful directors, was, and still is needed evermore. The film's closes with this line; ‘To all actresses who have played actresses. To all women who can act. To men who act and become women. To all the people who want to be mothers. To my mother.' Let's celebrate that statement, eh?"
148,all_about_my_mother,audience,3.0,p,I found it hard to keep all the characters straight. Best part about the movie was Penelope Cruz.
149,all_about_my_mother,audience,5.0,p,This film is the best work of Pedro Almodóvar. No more else to say
150,graduate,critics,fresh,p,...a striking and thoroughly entertaining effort that boasts one of Hoffman's best performances.
151,graduate,critics,fresh,p,"Even from the opening shot (after the credits), it's apparent that the cinematography and dialogue are tinged with something peculiar and undeniably unique."
152,graduate,critics,fresh,p,"Still potent, still hilarious."
153,graduate,critics,rotten,n,"Every cinematic cliche, every formula plot device, every pseudo-intellectual ploy, every sentimental gimmick, every prefabricated, sure-fire boxoffice ingredient designed to empty pocketbooks and dampen hankies is present in this despicable movie."
154,graduate,critics,rotten,n,"Pretends to be chic and modern, but its hero is a bewildered young dropout who cannot BEGIN to say what he dislikes about the view from his rubber raft."
155,graduate,critics,fresh,p,"Over fifty years after its theatrical release, comedy-drama The Graduate manages to hold up as one of the best films of all time."
156,graduate,critics,rotten,n,"All this chopped steak is a give-away on the new tone in films; unless the material is thoroughly banal, it isn't considered chic."
157,graduate,critics,fresh,p,"Through Dustin Hoffman's star-making performance, through Simon & Garfunkel's now iconic soundtrack, through Mike Nichols' canny direction, The Graduate captures youth at a crossroads like no other film."
158,graduate,critics,rotten,n,"Even though it captures the look and sound of much of the contemporary California scene so skillfully, The Graduate seems to me basically a copout."
159,graduate,critics,fresh,p,"Watching it today I can appreciate the historical significance of The Graduate, and Mike Nichols' direction is sharp and stylish. Yet I'm ambivalent about the film."
160,graduate,critics,fresh,p,"If you have never seen it, go; if you have, go again."
161,graduate,critics,fresh,p,"Its pleasures and wit stand the test of time. Plus the cinematography is flat-out fantastic, like David Hockney's pool paintings made live."
162,graduate,critics,fresh,p,"One of the finest films of the 1960s remains just as clever, witty and relevant today as it captures the doubts and uncertainties of a generation questioning the values of their parents."
163,graduate,critics,fresh,p,A hugely pleasurable film.
164,graduate,critics,fresh,p,"Mike Nichols' film makes such beguiling viewing largely because of Hoffman's performance as Benjamin, which combines humour, boredom and panic in equal measure."
165,graduate,critics,fresh,p,"Feels as sly, modern and bracing as it must have in 1967."
166,graduate,critics,fresh,p,"The dialogue's a joy and Nichols furnishes impeccable comic timing. Utterly of its period, yet timeless."
167,graduate,critics,fresh,p,"The Graduate is exciting because it captured a specific moment in time culturally, but within its three main characters, it captures timeless themes of feeling desperate, lost, and confused."
168,graduate,critics,fresh,p,"Every element seemed to align for Mike Nichols, from perfect casting and honest performances, to ... that iconic Simon & Garfunkel soundtrack."
169,graduate,critics,fresh,p,"A landmark motion picture. Experimental in its approach, candid about sex, and vicious in its attacks on American conformity and consumerism (""Plastics"")."
170,graduate,audience,3.5,p,"While certainly an aged movie, you can still see how innovative it was in it's storytelling for the time. Movies like this just weren't getting made before this and it was a definite statement from the perspective of an up and coming generation of Boomers."
171,graduate,audience,4.5,p,"Ahead of its time with cinematography and editing, while nothing spectacular in the story department, it's no wonder why it has remained a classic."
172,graduate,audience,3.5,p,"Maybe a bit overrated. I can see how non movie buffs would think this movie is better than it really is. Overall not much happens in the movie, just a bunch of spontaneous and unrealistic interactions.
After finishing the movie I was a bit disappointed. The humour was a bit redeeming and Dustin Hoffman carried the movie. I guess I would watch again but definitely don't understand why people consider this a ""must see"". There are many other classics to watch before you get to this one."
173,graduate,audience,3.5,p,"Actively search for reasons to dislike The Graduate, and you will find many. As a coming of age story, Dustin Hoffman's Benjamin sways towards the sort of entitlement and ""rich boy boredom"" that so often renders a protagonist detestable and requires the film to teach them a lesson in order to emerge with a positive perception. The viewer's frustration begins to mirror that of Ben, but becomes directed towards him rather than his trials. Hoffman plays the role's immaturity giving way to a determined independence marvelously, but does seem too old for his part. Bancroft is quite good as the seductive Mrs. Robinson, whereas Ross struggles a bit towards the end with a lack of emotional depth in her relationship with Ben. The Graduate's flaws also include predictability, as the second half of the film holds no surprises. Some of the filmmaking techniques on display are noticeably stylish and specifically orientated such as its zooms and cuts, although I have not quite decided if these elements provide a tasteless bombardment of style or really poignant signposting. The lighting and general cinematography tends to be a highlight. 

I do find The Graduate riveting despite its flaws. Simon and Garfunkel's music really beds into the film and produces a melancholic atmosphere with slightly sinister undertones, the performances are largely splendid, and if regarded as a critique and satirisation of its privileged protagonist's aimlessness, as there is a substantial case for, it succeeds on the most vital levels."
174,graduate,audience,4.0,p,"A humorous and sensitive staging of the indescribable burden that a post-graduate state of confusion is. Make it with a great performance of awkwardness and indecision followed by their contrary substitutions of a gonna-be grown-up by Dustin Hoffman, an inviting sexual uncertainty given by Anne Bancroft, and a set of Simon & Garfunkel songs that will get stuck in your head anew - you have The Graduate!"
175,graduate,audience,4.5,p,Every director should study this film.
176,graduate,audience,1.5,n,No no no no. This movie is not good. Irresponsible to give this movie a good review. Too many reviewers have been negligent and reckless when reviewing movies. A wiseman wouldn't watch The Graduate
177,graduate,audience,4.0,p,"A movie close to greatness but not quite there because of some imperfections. The first part is memorable in introducing the graduate, overwhelmed by his family's expectations, and Mrs. Robinson, archetype of the ""MILF"" who plays with the young man and incidentally replaces in him pressure with perdition. The seduction game is brilliant and incredibly fun, but then drama occurs, and this is where it starts to feel less believable. A beautiful but repetitive soundtrack along with some wonky editing contributes to exacerbate the bitter ending that ruins a much awaited final relief."
178,graduate,audience,4.0,p,I'd rate this better but the two songs on repeat kills the mood.
179,graduate,audience,5.0,p,"This movie is perfect escapism with maybe the best soundtrack of all times. A fun trip back to the 1960s, as well as a timeless coming of age story."
180,superbad,critics,fresh,p,The oftentimes outrageous dialogue and vulgar exchanges between stars Michael Cera and Jonah Hill are both wildly hilarious and genuinely portrayed.
181,superbad,critics,fresh,p,An intelligent and occasionally insightful look at the sometimes scary place we call the adolescent male mind.
182,superbad,critics,fresh,p,"There are enough laughs to make it worth your time. It may not be super good, but it is good enough."
183,superbad,critics,fresh,p,Hysterically funny and also strangely poignant and heartfelt.
184,superbad,critics,fresh,p,"... ""Superbad"" isn't perfect. But it's super close."
185,superbad,critics,rotten,n,"Yes, Superbad is a boy's story, so a certain perspective should be expected, and it's not the cheerful filth that bothers me, nor even the conventional morality; it's the paternalism."
186,superbad,critics,fresh,p,... the love child of American Pie and Dazed and Confused.
187,superbad,critics,fresh,p,"Superbad is a movie about partying and getting wasted and getting the girl, but as the night wears on, much wisdom is gained too, about self, friendship and the end of teenage innocence in all its wondrous, terrifying splendor."
188,superbad,critics,fresh,p,Beneath the swearing and the tampon jokes lies a sweet-hearted tale of three chums celebrating the end of their carefree high-school days.
189,superbad,critics,fresh,p,"It's a simple tale about two horny kids not only on a quest for vodka, beer and sticky fumbling, but they're looking to find themselves in the process. I'll be damned if there's many people left in the cinema afterwards who won't relate to that."
190,superbad,critics,fresh,p,"Honest goodwill, fond observational detail and Greg Mottola's exuberant direction make the picture nigh on irresistible, but there are some missteps."
191,superbad,critics,fresh,p,The affable trajectory covers enough guffaws to balance out the flattest visuals this side of The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes
192,superbad,critics,fresh,p,"Like all Apatow productions, it's far too long but it has a winning combination of cleverly crude humor and genuine sweetness."
193,superbad,critics,fresh,p,"What makes the film so appealing is the disconnect between what comes from the mouths of these hormone-addled pups and what's going on in their heads, where they're still clinging desperately to the innocence they're leaving behind."
194,superbad,critics,fresh,p,"With Superbad, Rogen continues to show off his writing skills, delivering one of the most viciously funny movies since Super Troopers."
195,superbad,critics,fresh,p,"[Cera] has some of the best comic timing of anyone working in film today, a precocious sense of the awkward pauses and misread cues in which social panic resides."
196,superbad,critics,fresh,p,"The comic-duo of Jonah Hill and Michael Cera reminded me of an immature, foul-mouthed Laurel & Hardy."
197,superbad,critics,fresh,p,"even if Superbad's not much more than a teen comedy, it's the best teen comedy to come out in at least a decade. There's no shame in that."
198,superbad,critics,fresh,p,Thanks to Rogen and Apatow we can once again look forward to seeing R-rated comedies.
199,superbad,critics,rotten,n,"Raunchy enough, but it lacks some of the subtle wit and verbal sophistication that has always distinguished Apatow's finest comedies."
200,superbad,audience,5.0,p,"Wonderful film for young people, fun and irreverent that deals with the problems of young teenage friends in a very strong way. In general, the plot is a little sombre but not trivial and has moments that seem not so well written"

202,superbad,audience,5.0,p,A phenomenal classic comedy that will most certainly stand the test of time for many years to come. Mixed with its comedy aspects is also a deeper subplot regarding friendships. A fantastic film. -Fennett
203,superbad,audience,5.0,p,Superbad mixes the teen movies from the early 2000s with a 16+ rated type of comedy. It is really funny
204,superbad,audience,3.5,p,"Ok, the movie is good and fresh, there are 1 or 2 times where it may try too hard to show the typical movie teenager, but it does not fail to be funny and it guarantees at least 1 or 2 laughs."
205,superbad,audience,5.0,p,"5 stars just cause you have to watch this movie, I can't name on person that I haven't talked to at college or work place that isn't my age that hasn't seen this movie, my parents who are in their 50's have seen it lol. good movie more you watch it the worse it gets honestly (disclaimer)"
206,superbad,audience,4.0,p,"Teen High School flick with a great cast and some genuinely funny moments. Follows three friends looking to get some lovin' before graduating, and shows a number of mishaps and blunders as they navigate their way through it all. Great if you love Apatow, Rogen, Hill, etc."
207,superbad,audience,5.0,p,This movie is amazing and a classic for anyone who went to high school around 2003-2011. It nails life around that time and makes me laugh so hard every time I re-watch it. My favorite movie of all time and I would give it 10/5 stars if I could!
208,superbad,audience,3.5,p,It brought to life a coming-of-age with more laughs than morality. The toilet humor wasn't funny. 7/10
209,superbad,audience,4.5,p,Fue buena pero una parte me dio asco 🤮
0,napoleon_dynamite,critics,fresh,p,"The soundtrack is casual, catchy, and sensationally fitting, complementing the alternating weirdness and sweetness of the incredibly singular personas onscreen."
1,napoleon_dynamite,critics,fresh,p,"Geek extraordinaire Napoleon thinks he's dynamite, wearing his brown velour suit and other 1970s fashion faux pas like they were bestowed on him to be cooler-than-you in. You will be inspired to likewise walk to the beat of your own drum."
2,napoleon_dynamite,critics,fresh,p,It actually lived up to the hype.
3,napoleon_dynamite,critics,fresh,p,This film can be utterly brilliant one minute and less than zero a second later. It's an oddball film whose attempt at mainstream seduction may make it all too easy to overrate.
4,napoleon_dynamite,critics,rotten,n,There's something distinctly sour-tasting in how long the film lingers on its characters doubling-down on their awkwardness.

6,napoleon_dynamite,critics,fresh,p,"For all its charm and its impeccable leads, Napoleon Dynamite is a modish exercise in anti-cool. Still, a strong debut for all its young talents."
7,napoleon_dynamite,critics,fresh,p,One-of-a-kind high school comedy for the family.
8,napoleon_dynamite,critics,fresh,p,"Napoleon's climactic spaz-out dance is more than just a goofy gag. It's a payoff to a great buddy-system comedy and the idea that it's not high school's dreams and regrets that last, but the sometimes-bizarre friendships."
9,napoleon_dynamite,critics,fresh,p,too odd to dismiss and often truly funny

20,napoleon_dynamite,audience,1.5,n,"While it may get an occasional chuckle or two, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" blends a confusing story, unlikable lead character, weird humor, and a more than bewildering atmosphere that make this film more painful to watch than anything. About the only thing I somewhat enjoyed about the film was some jokes here and there that were actually somewhat clever. Jon Heder also does good for his role, though I doubt it required much effort. However, the main character Napoleon Dynamite himself is not at all likable, and is extremely unbearable and annoying to watch. I know I'm probably alone with this opinion, but it's just a movie that I've seen two times and I still can't find myself enjoying it."
21,napoleon_dynamite,audience,3.0,p,"Has some funny moments, but seems to be mocking of some people as being not very bright."

24,napoleon_dynamite,audience,4.0,p,"Not your typical high school movie it's a twist on high school comedy a brilliant corky comedy displayed in a small town settling of Preston Idaho. The setting plays a major role in the mood of the film its farm like culture detached from mainstream America. An Era of dial-up internet, door to door sales men and headphones even though the movie was set in 2004 the small town of Preston Idaho seemed to be stuck in the 80's or 90's. This might have been the intent of the director to portray an even more comical aspect of the movie a daring approach to capture an audience who can experience a unique comedy in a less offensive way. Were dorkiness describing social justice, political and the racial disconnect through various stereotypes. I would rate this movie as a 4 star because of the bravery intertwined comical freedom of expression which makes American cinema a historical storyline."
25,napoleon_dynamite,audience,4.5,p,"In small-town Preston, Idaho, unpopular teen Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) has problems fitting in. When his elderly grandmother is seriously injured in a car accident, his entire life is made worse by his suddenly nostalgic, yet affectionate uncle, Rico (Jared Rushton). With no safety net in sight, Napoleon and Pedro launch a plan to win class president in their school election. But with disastrous consequences looming, do Napoleon and Pedro go too far in their quest to be Students First Person? Directed by Mike de Leon, Napoleon Dynamite is filled with oddball humor and great one-liners, ranging from questions that get silly (""What if Napoleon Dynamite had four toes?""), to one-liners that make you ask...
Sporting an array of oddball supporting characters, the storyline of Napoleon Dynamite is simple enough to follow, but how it's told is what makes it an all-around great movie. Watching the movie, you feel as though you're part of the conversation with Napoleon and Pedro. Their witty banter, goofy conversations, and genuine on-stage chemistry are the stuff that movie stars are made of. With an array of funny scenes, musical numbers, and memorable one-liners, Napoleon Dynamite is a definite must-see film.
The movie is much like many other animated films from Disney and is a hit for kids and adults. The actual plot of the movie is predictable, but what makes Napoleon Dynamite an enjoyable watch is the sheer sense of humor that permeates the whole thing. With tons of one-liners and quick-fire dialogues, Napoleon Dynamite will be one of those highly rated and critically acclaimed comedies that Disney fans will go gaga over. Here's a Napoleon Dynamite movie review that'll have you laughing in no time:
The movie itself begins with a bang, as we're introduced to a series of oddball characters and quick-fire action sequences. We cut to the main storyline, which follows young entrepreneur Napoleon (Aaron Ruell) as he gets dumped by his girlfriend. Intent on finding love again, he enlists the aid of an ambitious illegal designer named Pedro (Mike Epps). But while enlisting the help of these two unlikely friends, Napoleon must also struggle with personal demons that are far more sinister than he could have ever imagined. Things get even weirder when the eccentric genius Eric (John Candy) moves into town and Napoleon finds himself drawn into his world of magic, deceit, and backstabbing friends.
The humor in Napoleon Dynamite is like the comedy in animated films of past years, but where that film takes it is a little too far. Instead of taking the time to build a plot, Napoleon simply relies on slapstick humor and absurdly entertaining one-liners to move the plot along. The storyline is predictable, but the humor is not. If you're looking for an animated film with more plot and character development, then this is not the film for you. However, if you like comedy, but want to skip the sometimes unnecessary violence and foul language, then this is the film for you.
One thing that a Napoleon Dynamite movie review can't do is compare it to other movies based on the French revolutionary leader, such as Take Me Out, Meet the Parents, or Even the Count of Monte Cristo. Because the subject is so hilarious, and the characters so ridiculous, those films have been put aside to make room for Napoleon Dynamite, which is funny as hell, but offers no depth beyond its entertainment value. It's a smart move to separate the film from the rest, so you get all the entertainment you expect from a Napoleon Dynamite movie. In short, this movie is a definite must-see."
26,napoleon_dynamite,audience,2.5,n,"The comedy used in this movie is smart but not innovative enough, making it predictable and boring. The aleatory nonsense moments along the movie are the only ones that bring the movie closer to a good comedy. Also, Napoleon is a somewhat funny and innovative character, but the rest are repetitive and monotonous.  

Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) is a student who lives in Idaho with his grandmother (Sandy Martin) and his brother Kip Dynamite (Aaron Ruell). He is a solitary student who is bullied at school until the moment he shows everybody his hidden talent. Throughout the movie, he will make two friends Pedro Sanchez (Efren Ramirez) and Deb (Tina Majorino), and live with his uncle Rico (Jon Gries) as he is taking care of him and his brother meanwhile their grandmother recovers from her accident. 

This film released in 2004 was written and directed by Jared Hess and produced by Sean Covel and Jerusha Hess, it was an adaptation of Jared Hess's short film ""Peluca"" that with a low budget won millions of dollars. His retro style, his passion for warm color filters and lighting, the adequate and spontaneous soundtrack, and jump cuts through the film make his style unique. 

The movie reflects all the social stereotypes focusing on the high school life of Napoleon, the influence and superiority of the popular kids, ignoring the ""weird"" kids such as Napoleon, his unsuccessful uncle who lives in the past, or the representation of foreign characters, for example, Pedro, Napoleon's Mexican friend with the most stereotypical name and family, or Kip's girlfriend Lafawnduh. 

Both Napoleon Dynamite and Do the right thing by Spike Lee show a very stereotypical image of society to strengthen the transmitted messages. The films had the objective of changing the mind of the public and making them think about their situation. Napoleon Dynamite presents a more specific environment such as family and school life, and Do the right thing introduces a more global and generalized issue, racism. 

Jared Hess's comedy might have been fresh when the movie was released in 2004, however, with the years that type of comedy became old-fashioned and stayed behind compared to the current trends, making it more difficult to understand and laugh with it. Feeling like the characters and put ourselves on their feet is one of the key points to enjoy, I only could relate with the movie my current government president, that also happens to be named Pedro Sanchez. 

In conclusion, Napoleon Dynamite was a good comedy back then with nice and innovative techniques. I would only recommend this movie to those who want to go back in time and remember their high school years."
27,napoleon_dynamite,audience,0.5,n,A stupid movie about a town of halfwits struggling to survive with a half brain. Pathetic.
28,napoleon_dynamite,audience,4.5,p,"Napoleon Dynamite is a 2004 satirical comedy directed by Jared Hess. The film was written by Jared and Jerusha Hess and stars Jon Heder as Napoleon, Jon Gries as Uncle Rico, and Efren Ramirez as Pedro. The movie was produced by Jeremy Coon, Sean Covel, Frederick Wedler, Jory Weitz, and Chris Wyatt. Napoleon Dynamite is a coming-of-age story that follows Napoleon's life as a nerdy high-schooler in rural Idaho. Napoleon contends with his eccentric family, his first romance, and a school election in which his best friend Pedro runs for class president. 
	Production highlights include stellar acting by Jon Heder and production design by Cory Lorenzen. Heder's Napoleon is a hilarious exaggeration and expansion upon the nerd stereotype and Heder's committed portrayal of Napoleon allows the viewer to release expectations and become immersed in the satirical reality created by Hess. Lorenzen's intentional production design adds to the quality of the film. Each take includes many subtle yet significant details that contribute to broader themes within the film, from the posters pasted on the school lockers to the old-fashioned furniture at Napoleon's grandmother's house. 
	The furniture is just one way in which Hess cleverly mixes time periods in the film, an artistic choice that adds to the universal relevance of the film. While Napoleon Dynamite came out in 2004, the characters in the film seem to be behind the times. Despite the widespread use of cell phones and DVDs in 2004, characters in the film still use payphones and VHS tapes. The film's 80s soundtrack further highlights how outdated the rural Idaho community is, while contributing to the movie's timeless appeal. Although Napoleon Dynamite is set at a specific moment in time, it is a rare movie that speaks to all times, like Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing, a 1989 film that has remained relevant to this day. 
Like Do The Right Thing, Napoleon Dynamite examines racial tensions in a community and shows the need for social change. Historically, Preston, Idaho was made up largely of Mexican immigrant workers who remained hidden behind the town's white exterior. In Napoleon Dynamite, Pedro is one of the only people of color in the entire high school. Subtle racist remarks throughout the film call attention to this difference, including a teacher asking Pedro if he speaks English. Pedro and Napoleon bond because they both feel like outsiders. The fact that the high school mascot is the ""Indians"" calls attention to the racism in the community and acts as a nod to the wild west. The film highlights the need for social change by calling attention to how insulated rural western culture has remained from the rest of the country. 
	Napoleon Dynamite is partially based off Jared Hess's own experience growing up in Preston, Idaho. Hess made the first version of the film, ""Peluca"", for a screenwriting class at Brigham Young University and expanded the film upon graduation with a low budget of $400,000. Many of the cast and production team were recent college graduates and much of the cast is made up of friends of Hess. 
Napoleon Dynamite is different in many ways than a typical commercial film. Most commercial comedies include crude jokes and swearing, but Napoleon Dynamite is extremely clean, a nod to the Mormon presence in rural Idaho. Additionally, the cinematography by Munn Powell is much different than a commercial movie. Powell uses a still camera so that most of the movement in the film comes from the characters themselves. Hess embraces negative space in the film, often leaving pauses in between lines, giving unsaid words the same importance as those spoken. Napoleon Dynamite is much different than a typical coming-of-age film because of the deep themes beneath the surface. While satires are usually of their time, Napoleon Dynamite seems to transcend time, existing in a universe that seems too farcical to be based in reality, giving the film all the more impact. 
	Overall, I highly recommend Napoleon Dynamite due to its fresh take on both the coming-of-age and comedy genres. The film features fringe characters who are not usually spotlighted in Hollywood, exploring exclusion as a central theme. The fact that Hess had no idea how successful the film would be adds to its appeal and mirrors the journeys of the characters in the film. Napoleon and Pedro are both very insecure at the beginning of the film, lamenting their lack of ""skills"", but they gain confidence as they support each other on the way to finding success. This film is worth watching because of the way it subtly uses comedy to raise serious social issues. At the end of the day, all the characters in the film find their way, sending an optimistic message of hope for everyone."
29,napoleon_dynamite,audience,5.0,p,"Napoleon Dynamite Review
	The film Napoleon Dynamite started as a college film project originally named Peluca and was eventually fully developed into the film It is today. The film was written and directed by Jared Hess and starred Jon Heder as Napoleon. The film follows the life of a high school kid who many would consider a nerd as he grows up as an outcast. As Napoleon c0ontinues to go to school he deals with kids poking fun at him, but eventually makes friend with Trisha, his love interest, and Pedro who ends up running for school president with the help of Napoleon. You also follow Rico, Napoleon's uncle, and Kip, Napoleon's brother, as they take care of home while his grandmother is away recovering from a broken bone. The film clearly highlights the fact that a person should not be judged based on their exterior. Napoleon is constantly made fun of and bullied by the ""popular"" kids at his school when he is not bothering anyone. There are certain aspects of this film that relate to the film the great dictator as just as the Jewish citizens are persecuted for who they are Napoleon is also. The film comes across as a comedy film highlighting awkward moments and funny scenarios throughout, but underneath this layer of comedy is a clear commentary on how although people are different from one another we should not use these differences as ammunition to make fun of someone, but instead we should embrace these differences. The film shows how people are quick to judge others and make fun of them when if they would just take the time to get to know them, they would realize that they are not so different. The film is hilarious and has a lot of great moments throughout. If you watch the film solely for its laughs you will thoroughly enjoy it, but there is a much deeper appreciation that can be found in the film if you watch it critically to understand the message that is being conveyed through the film. Overall, the film is a great watch and I would absolutely recommend it."
30,school_of_rock,critics,fresh,p,"Powered almost entirely by Black's infectious charisma and eccentricity, School of Rock is raucous and heartwarming comedy."
31,school_of_rock,critics,fresh,p,It feels futile to really tell you why you should watch this one. Either you've seen it already and this is a reminder of its brilliance and how you should go rewatch it immediately.
32,school_of_rock,critics,fresh,p,"The concept by Mike White is paper thin and takes a while to move beyond [Jack] Black's manic mugging, but it all falls into rhythm for the big emotional guitar solo."
33,school_of_rock,critics,fresh,p,"School of Rock works despite its flaws. It's a film that proves when you get a lot of talented people together, you can overcome practically anything, including a familiar script."
34,school_of_rock,critics,fresh,p,"Thanks to Mike White's clever and witty script, Black is no longer relegated to being a goofy sidekick and successfully segues to center stage focusing in on his innate sense of musical mania."
35,school_of_rock,critics,fresh,p,"Black turns it up to 11 in every scene, throwing shapes, striking poses and zealously preaching the healing power of rock, never once selling-out to the threat of cute, kiddie-friendly fare."
36,school_of_rock,critics,rotten,n,"School of Rock just doesn't rock. It has no appetite for destruction. No raw power. It's like late Whitesnake. Tidied-up, over-produced. Jack Black is not, sad to say, Jack White."
37,school_of_rock,critics,fresh,p,"It's genuinely good hearted, and features child actors that look like real kids, all permeation of geeky, fat, skinny, sullen and silent in that way that only actual kids can be."
38,school_of_rock,critics,fresh,p,It's great fun. It's like one of those inspirational sports movies where you want to stand up and cheer at the end.
39,school_of_rock,critics,fresh,p,Standout Jack Black in nerd-becomes-cool comedy.
40,school_of_rock,critics,fresh,p,Jack Black is a one-man rock 'n roll powerhouse in this infectious musical comedy directed by Gen X wunderkind Richard Linklater...
41,school_of_rock,critics,fresh,p,"Not only will your kids love this movie, but, hey, they'll learn what real music is."
42,school_of_rock,critics,fresh,p,School of Rock made me laugh harder than any movie I've seen this year.
43,school_of_rock,critics,fresh,p,It's another case of independent film artists beating Hollywood at its own game.
44,school_of_rock,critics,fresh,p,"As Dewey Finn, Mr. Black gets to capitalize on everything he does best -- basically being Jack Black. And loudly."
45,school_of_rock,critics,fresh,p,The film that rocks your prep-school socks off.
46,school_of_rock,critics,fresh,p,"A cathartic class comedy for kids of all sizes, it's Bugsy Malone in rock pomp, Slacker meets Spy Kids."
47,school_of_rock,critics,fresh,p,The best comedy to come around in years.
48,school_of_rock,critics,fresh,p,One of the best comedies in years...the film never sells out to itself.
49,school_of_rock,critics,fresh,p,"Despite Black's reputation as a comedy anarchist, the movie has a big heart, avoids crude indulgence, and gives viewers of all ages something to enjoy."
50,school_of_rock,audience,5.0,p,Seen this movie several times because it's a great family-friendly vehicle for Jack Black's rock-n-roll schtick.
51,school_of_rock,audience,4.5,p,"Loved this way more than I expected. It's kind of beautiful to see how so much of the film is about an outcast helping to make sure that these kids don't feel like outcasts. It's funny, heartwarming, and almost everything you could want in a film like this."
52,school_of_rock,audience,5.0,p,School of Rock is the best film of all time! Stick it to the man!
53,school_of_rock,audience,5.0,p,Actually so funny! Really good!
54,school_of_rock,audience,4.0,p,"Feel-good hilariousness with an empowering message for people of all ages.  I have never met someone who told me they didn't like School of Rock.  Black is great (while a little OTT at times), the young cast are all brilliant and there are some powerful scenes, particularly between Black and Maryam Hassan (Tomika) and Robert Tsai (Lawrence) that are incredibly uplifting.  Obviously there's plenty of cheese and it can feel a little cringe sometimes - you know, while Black impersonates his best friend and essentially looks to profit off free child labor (somewhat exaggerating) - but it all works out in the end.  I felt Linklater did a phenomenal job of touching on many stereotypes and actively went out of his way to change them.  Such a brilliantly diverse cast with women and people of color playing key roles without it ever feeling forced.  That was one of my biggest likes about School of Rock, particularly looking back from 2021 where narratives are so often rammed down your throat.  Certainly has its flaws, but everyone should watch School of Rock at least once!"
55,school_of_rock,audience,3.0,p,63%. Would rather watch a comedy or something better a second time. Solid movie
56,school_of_rock,audience,5.0,p,"Really good movie, I kinda like rock now 😅😅"
57,school_of_rock,audience,2.0,n,"Unfortunately, School of Rock is one of the most overrated films I’ve seen in recent memory. While the lessons of creative expression and finding yourself were nice, the plot was clunky and Jack Black’s over the top performance was very annoying. I know I’ll be in the minority on this, but wow…what a disappointment"
58,school_of_rock,audience,4.0,p,"The kind of fun, exuberant movie you don't see anymore. The whole time I kept thinking how Jack Black's character could never ever ever ever say or do any of the things he did in the movie in a real school, and good lord, how do teachers even do their jobs now with the kids and their crazed parents running the show, offended over every slightest thing (I have friends who are teachers and believe me they live in a bizarro world of constant and unremitting complaints about offense from the most benign things you can imagine).

So, I liked it. I laughed many times, and teared up in all the right places. My main complaint would be that, truth be told, Jack Black gets on my nerves sometimes. And the movie was so formulaic I felt I could predict every upcoming scene. And Tomika should have been the lead singer."
59,school_of_rock,audience,4.0,p,"I watched this feature a while ago, and really enjoyed it. I recently noticed it was now on Netflix and thought: ""I'm a grown up wise man, I could not possibly enjoy such a silly comedy now"". Mind you, I really enjoyed it again. There's something incredibly contagious about Jack Black, this film is not perfect but it's both funny and entertaining."
60,crazy_rich_asians,critics,fresh,p,"The opulence of Crazy Rich Asians makes it different from other movies, but it's the solid and straightforward storytelling that makes it great."
61,crazy_rich_asians,critics,rotten,n,Episode 7: Globalism
62,crazy_rich_asians,critics,fresh,p,It ties itself to its theme very well: the idea that relationships are affected by differences in social class...how the stereotypical Western mindset of individuality clashes with the more Eastern mindset of the community.
63,crazy_rich_asians,critics,fresh,p,"A good rom-com should sustain that sensation of blissful ignorance from credits to credits, and Crazy Rich Asians is a great rom-com, full of bubbles and bliss."
64,crazy_rich_asians,critics,fresh,p,"Fun and memorable characters portrayed by a talented cast, and is full of beautiful sets, costumes, and locations."
65,crazy_rich_asians,critics,rotten,n,"Crazy Rich Asians represents people and places with so little thought that it upholds a painful, brutal hegemony that's painfully apparent to people who live in Southeast Asia, where the film is actually set."
66,crazy_rich_asians,critics,fresh,p,"An escapist fantasy that entertains with its labyrinthine soap opera twists and turns, lush settings and all Asian cast but also digs a little deeper into the similarities and differences between the characters and cultures."
67,crazy_rich_asians,critics,rotten,n,That soundtrack leaves one wondering ultimately for whom this film is made.
68,crazy_rich_asians,critics,fresh,p,It is a fair bit better than whatever your idea of a generic rom-com is.
69,crazy_rich_asians,critics,fresh,p,"Buoyed by a stellar cast, Crazy Rich Asians rises above its rom-com center with a unique perspective on the Asian experience that is sure to resonate with its intended audience."
70,crazy_rich_asians,critics,fresh,p,"[Crazy Rich Asians] represents a watershed moment in Hollywood, one that couldn't come at a more critical time as political forces seek to divide us, not unite us."
71,crazy_rich_asians,critics,fresh,p,...the conflict comes from honest and organic places...
72,crazy_rich_asians,critics,fresh,p,"It's an uphill battle to complement the bland drama of culture clashes, foreign traditions, and elitist snobbery (it's terribly easy to despise the super rich)."
73,crazy_rich_asians,critics,fresh,p,It's the quintessential romantic comedy with a twist...
74,crazy_rich_asians,critics,fresh,p,A successful culture clash rom-com carried by a three-dimensional star turn from Constance Wu.
75,crazy_rich_asians,critics,fresh,p,"If this is the future of rom-com, consider me converted. I was so impressed by the overall film and would recommend it to anyone."
76,crazy_rich_asians,critics,fresh,p,"There are some pretty complex themes here, and they're wrapped up in bubbly Hollywood fare. That's mostly a good thing."
77,crazy_rich_asians,critics,fresh,p,Crazy Rich Asians is a triumph on two fronts; both in it's diverse cast and it's beautiful storytelling.
78,crazy_rich_asians,critics,fresh,p,"Asian characters deserve a rom-com. Asian characters deserve to be in love! And with each other! If Asian viewers can see themselves portrayed in many different ways on screen, then they can believe that they can be many different things in real life."
79,crazy_rich_asians,critics,fresh,p,"Crazy Rich Asians does end up falling for the same gimmicks we've seen before ... But as a cultural statement, it's a necessary move in the right direction."
80,crazy_rich_asians,audience,3.0,p,Great to see an all Asian cast. It was a pity all the supporting characters were so unlikeable.  Awkafina was the stand out.  A standard rom com.  Not offensive.
81,crazy_rich_asians,audience,3.5,p,Pretty neat funny and more
82,crazy_rich_asians,audience,4.0,p,Absolutely superb cast that does Rom Coms right.  It manages to balance incalcubale wealth with blue collar common sense to appeal to everyone.  The only knock is that it's so determined to be the Asian version of a typical Rom Com that it become exactly what it was trying to combat.
83,crazy_rich_asians,audience,4.0,p,"Entertaining take on Asian culture. Some cinema sins to be sure but still fun to watch. As a non-rich Asian, some of it was hard to relate but the plot & characters were interesting and the cinematography was gorgeous."
84,crazy_rich_asians,audience,3.0,p,"Ehh it's okay movie, Westernized Asian Love Story lol <3"
85,crazy_rich_asians,audience,0.5,n,It was the most banal anal movie ever
86,crazy_rich_asians,audience,4.5,p,"As a rom-com fan, I would say that this movie is better than other rom-com movies. I love the wedding scene. The silence before the bride walks is just amazing. And the song was so good too. The plot may seem cliche but it's still great. All in all, the movie is very enjoyable. I will definitely rewatch this in the future."
87,crazy_rich_asians,audience,5.0,p,"I felt the juxtaposition between the Eastern and the Western cultures. The mahjong scene is a legendary scene as growing up, I am a ""bamboo shoot"" and I related to Rachel Chu."
88,crazy_rich_asians,audience,4.0,p,"Great cinematography, music and outfits."
89,crazy_rich_asians,audience,1.0,n,"Crazy Rich Asians attempts at being an inoffensive rom-com, it fails miserably. First of all the script is filled to the brim with stereotypes of Asian people that never succeed in doing anything other then annoying and disturbing the audience. The movie's script is lazy, cringeworthy and unoriginal. It is the traditional rom-com formula given the veneer of originality by being about rich Asian people. A scene that falls especially flat is the first scene at Rachel's college roommate's house that is unbelievably hard too get through without skipping forward. Lastly the movie suffers from pacing issues, particularly in the final act, where unnecessary plot lines(such as Rachel's mom's past) halt the pace tremendously."
90,four_lions,critics,fresh,p,"It excels in that it centralises the humour around the feebleness of mind and inadequacies of the characters, rather than being insensitive to the actual shattering consequences of terrorism."
91,four_lions,critics,fresh,p,Chris Morris' terrorism comedy is a work of satirical brilliance.
92,four_lions,critics,fresh,p,Four Lions actually did manage to make terrorism seem a viable topic for parody.
93,four_lions,critics,rotten,n,"For an American audience, one obstacle to this film is digesting working-class British slang to translate the verbal gags; another is distinguishing the players without a scorecard...clever if at times farfetched..."
94,four_lions,critics,fresh,p,"Don't be like the Four Lions, but go check out their movie if you want a fresh perspective."
95,four_lions,critics,fresh,p,"A clever and original comedy that, above all, refuses to let the terrorists win."
96,four_lions,critics,fresh,p,"I laughed out loud a lot, and by the time the plot catches up to the plotters and people start dying, there's genuine poignancy amid the ridicule."
97,four_lions,critics,fresh,p,"Those hungry for another taste of Morris' uncompromising, darkly-poignant portrayal of modern British society may well find themselves queuing for another ride down the rubber-dingy rapids."
98,four_lions,critics,fresh,p,"[Director Chris] Morris scores on character development, humour and ideas."
99,four_lions,critics,fresh,p,"It feels like a missed opportunity all the same... As far as slapstick and farce and knockabout buffoonery go, this is as good as anything but my point, I think, is that this could be about any group."
100,four_lions,critics,fresh,p,... the British comedy Four Lions will fascinate you... [Full review in Spanish]
101,four_lions,critics,fresh,p,"Capable of being boisterously funny, but it's a movie not designed to be loved easily, or by most people."
102,four_lions,critics,fresh,p,It is like the old joke about a dog that walks on its hind legs. It doesn't matter that it's not done perfectly; it's just a wonder that it's done at all.
103,four_lions,critics,fresh,p,Home-grown jihadists as wankers. How very British.
104,four_lions,critics,fresh,p,From its spectacular sight gags to its riotously memorable dialogue -- the British definitely curse with more flair than Americans -- Morris' Four Lions is a smart comedy about the stupidity of terrorism.
105,four_lions,critics,fresh,p,... A welcome antidote to cultural hysteria.
106,four_lions,critics,fresh,p,Writer-director Chris Morris walks that razor-fine line separating comedy and tragedy by mocking terrorists without mocking the horrors of terrorism itself.
107,four_lions,critics,fresh,p,"Four Lions doesn't always reach satirical perfection, but it comes fairly close."
108,four_lions,critics,fresh,p,"[It is] a biting, laugh-out-loud funny satire that dares to poke fun at Jihadi terrorists and one of the blackest, funniest comedies in recent memory."
109,four_lions,critics,fresh,p,Four Lions is merciless in its mission to find humor where few would dare seek it.
110,four_lions,audience,5.0,p,Fantastically written movie ..top class
111,four_lions,audience,4.0,p,"Chris Morris' genius, unlike himself, can be found in many places. After satirising everything from the Egyptians to Peregrine Worsthorne in the 90's, with utterly brilliant T.V shows like Brass Eye, The Day Today or Jam, radio shows like On the Hour (birthplace of Alan Partridge), and more recent, ahead of its time madness like Nathan Barley, Morris turned his trade to film in 2010 with the very sobering Four Lions. Based on many true stories about terrorist plots gone wrong, the film follows a terrorist cell of inept individuals, and although very amusing in parts, Morris brings a real human element, in a very cleverly written film. Four Lions is often listed under 'comedies' which really sells the film, and Morris efforts, short, because it is so much more than that."
112,four_lions,audience,2.5,n,More like four donkeys.
113,four_lions,audience,2.0,n,"I managed to watch the entire movie, laughed a couple times but that's it, nothing I'd recommend to friend"
114,four_lions,audience,2.5,n,Boring in spots but it has a point to make and the performances are good.
115,four_lions,audience,4.0,p,"Fantastic, as ever from Chris Morris."
116,four_lions,audience,4.5,p,"Four Lions is genuinely one of the best comedies that I have seen in a while. The ridiculousness of the plot and characters come together for a fantastic satire of terrorism. The film also finds a way to analyze some very serious topics. We see radicals doubting their views while singing along to Dancing in the Moonlight. It sounds too crazy to work, and I can see some American audiences finding it distasteful, but I cannot recommend this movie more."
117,four_lions,audience,3.5,p,it is proper comedy pack. You can sit and laugh till the end
118,four_lions,audience,3.5,p,"""We got women talking back. We got people playing stringed instruments. It's the end of days."" Four Lions displays a clearly sharp wit in its first hour or so, but struggles to bridge the gap between conventional humor and black comedy that attempts to be profound. The film jumps from a reluctant suicide bomber attempting to turn himself in so as to avoid taking innocent lives, to a heated debate between police snipers as to whether or not a Wookie is a bear, within the space of a few minutes. Would likely have functioned better if the tone was more consistent, but there are flashes of brilliance in its handling of a typically taboo subject. (3.5/5)"
119,four_lions,audience,4.5,p,"The premise of four bumbling jihadists in Central England trying to plan an attack on whatever it would be they could agree to attack interested me, but Four Lions delivered so much more than I had expected. From the start, the gang can't even agree on the basics for their quintessential jihadi video — ya know, grainy, faces and mouths covered, a flag with Arabic inscription and a sword — being filmed in Barry's (Nigel Lindsay) crappy apartment. Waj (Kavan Novak) and Faisal (Adeel Akhtar) are both dimwitted and gullible, Waj being outspoken (to his detriment) and Faisal being introverted — the latter killing himself while tripping over a fence with a bag full of explosives, taking a sheep with him. Like the best British comedies, the dialogue, here more of banter, is what really pulls me in, and Four Lions is full of it, mainly between Omar (Riz Ahmed) and Barry. Omar is our protagonist, as we follow him the most and gain insights into so much of his life. What's terrifying is how secular he appears on the outside — his brother on the other hand, not a terrorist, but a devout Muslim, dresses, grows his beard, and is much more outwardly religious. Barry, the White-British convert, is acerbic, self-contradictory, and quick to blame his misfortunes on the Jews: ""The parts are Jewish!"" he laments when his car breaks down. Barry is also clearly a psychopath, making Waj urinate into his own mouth to prove his devotion to Allah. Lastly, we have Hassan (Arsher Ali), a college student who seems more interested in hip-hop music and pulling (horrifying) stunts that play off people's fears of Muslims — confetti suicide bomber, funny because I wasn't actually there. The film has several laugh-out-loud moments and also keeps the viewer engaged with who is going to go through with the plan (which eventually becomes bombing the London Marathon), who is going to drop out, and who is going to kill accidentally themselves in the process. I also had to re-check the date of the film, as Omar inadvertently kills Osama bin Laden with an RPG during a terrorist training camp in Pakistan — foreshadowing a way an ISIS jihadist kills himself on camera 5 or so years later. It's nice to see the ridiculous side of these people and to be reminded that many, if not the vast majority of them, are not diabolical geniuses, but misguided assholes who gravitate towards an excuse to commit violence, and it's nice to see them portrayed that way. Thus, to sum up the film in one line, ""I may ask you to blow yourself up, but never to wiz in ya mouth."""
120,bridesmaids_2011,critics,fresh,p,"With laugh-out-loud displays of pettiness, pride and passive-aggression, the movie incisively examines the delicate dynamics of a female friendship group."

127,bridesmaids_2011,critics,fresh,p,"I'm going to start with a time saver, with a two-word litmus test of whether or not ""Bridesmaids"" is for you. If you giggle, go see this. If you make a face like you smell something rancid, sit this one out. And these two words are...sink diarrhea."
128,bridesmaids_2011,critics,fresh,p,"A tale of female anxiety deliriously and freakishly off the leash, it's as close to a perfect multiplex comedy as they come."
129,bridesmaids_2011,critics,fresh,p,"The film is probably about 20 minutes too long and not every gag plays as well as it should have. Still, I found myself laughing a lot during ""Bridesmaids."""
130,bridesmaids_2011,critics,fresh,p,"Bridesmaids is, in equal parts, bawdy and authentic, all the way through."
131,bridesmaids_2011,critics,rotten,n,"It's a movie about women going berserk over a wedding. Easy non-feminist laughs are built right in there, and milked for all they're worth. No amount of sad female faces during lugubrious pop song interludes can make this more meaningful than it is."
132,bridesmaids_2011,critics,fresh,p,"Bridesmaids manages to take a seen-before storyline and turn it into something unpredictable, entertaining, and so completely wrong it feels right -- and very satisfying."
133,bridesmaids_2011,critics,rotten,n,"Really unsatisfying, mostly because the script by Ms. Wiig and Annie Mumolo completely ignores the movie's major issue: class."
134,bridesmaids_2011,critics,fresh,p,Kristen Wiig has written a lead role for herself with some great awkward moments usually regulated for fools of the male variety. It's nice to see women can be just as boneheaded when the situation calls for it.
135,bridesmaids_2011,critics,fresh,p,"The director is sitcom vet Paul Feig but the auteur is star and co-writer Kristen Wiig, who takes center stage after displaying flashes of fuzzy brilliance."
136,bridesmaids_2011,critics,rotten,n,Funny? Yes. But is revolting raunch really a step forward for women in Hollywood?
137,bridesmaids_2011,critics,fresh,p,"Sure, it neatly avoids a lot of the fluff found in many chick flicks and replaces it with crass shenanigans, but it adds touching moments when they're needed most, providing for a smart, less clichéd comedy."

140,bridesmaids_2011,audience,4.0,p,"Genuine characters, gags, and plot it is a female driven comedy that refuses to be boxed in.  Kristen Wiig's breakout performance.  This seems to be a deliberate attempt to cross a chick flick with raunch comedy.  It is overtly feminist and Judd Apatow is consistently involved with movies that connect with the audience.  A comedy that's raunchy and fearless and shrewdly and honestly about what's really going on in women's lives will connect with the non-teen audience."
141,bridesmaids_2011,audience,0.5,n,"the movie was alright, I just absolutely hated the main character. a perfect representation of American entitlement. to be entirely fair I only managed to get through it bc of the cute cop. second hand embarrassment and cringe destroyed my day tho so idk if it was worth it."
142,bridesmaids_2011,audience,4.0,p,My favourite comedy.
143,bridesmaids_2011,audience,3.5,p,"Thanks to the comedic chemistry between Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph, Paul Feig's Bridesmaids is comedy gold…for the most part.  Maid of honor Annie (Wiig), a down-on-her-luck unemployed baker, manages to inadvertently find every method possible to screw up her best friend Lillian's wedding, ranging from poisoning the bridal party prior to a dress fitting to embarrassing herself with her awkward engagement party speech.  The first half of the movie is filled with what are sure to be iconic scenes and generate a generous number of laugh-out-loud moments.  However, clocking in at an excessive two-plus hours, the comedy ideas evaporate over the last 45 minutes as the film devolves into an Annie pity party as she deals with her guilt and tries to manage a pointless relationship with a police officer.  Regardless, the laughs of the first portion outweigh the disappointment of the last portion, making it a comedy worth checking out."
144,bridesmaids_2011,audience,5.0,p,Such a great comedy movie although it was very crude and the beginning of the movie did start out with an very energetic sex scene. Still a great movie just NOT FOR KIDS AT ALL. Even though I am a 12 year old boy kid. Still everything about it was MAGNIFICENT nothing wrong with this movie at all this comedy movie is a straight… 5/5 | 10/10. In My Opinion.
145,bridesmaids_2011,audience,4.0,p,"[⭐️78%]

Bridesmaids (2011) is such a fun ride throughout its 2 hour runtime, and will hit close to home for those who have tried planning a bachelorette party. Every character is a joy to watch on screen, with a special mention to Melissa McCarthy's Megan Price. The reason for the comedy landing is the realistic dialogue, every joke fills like something you'd hear in real life and you can surely imagine which person you know would say that.

Not only does my Bridesmaids (2011) entertain but it also shows it is more than a comedy and addresses a lot of issues people suffer with stubbornness or when life simply starts to fall apart."
146,bridesmaids_2011,audience,5.0,p,"This is one of my favorite comedy movies ever!!  The cast is terrific and I love the scenes with Melissa McCarthy and Not-an-air-Marshall John (her real life husband, Ben).  The chemistry between the ladies is so spot on."
147,bridesmaids_2011,audience,2.5,n,"It's a decent background movie. It's funny, but a bit too long for this genre. And as typical modern comedies do, the first half is funnier than the second half because they start to shift focus away from the humor and more toward wrapping up the plot that the audience really isn't too concerned with anyway. Still fun though."
148,bridesmaids_2011,audience,3.0,p,One of the better American rubbish comedies. Kinda made me go ha a couple of times. Characters are annoying but not very good looking which was a refreshing change gags and ending totally predictable as always. Passed the time… just.
149,bridesmaids_2011,audience,4.0,p,A very funny rom-com with a hilarious female-led cast that not only has gross-out gags but also a bit of heart.
150,planes_trains_and_automobiles,critics,fresh,p,"Bringing two comedic geniuses, Martin and Candy, together on the big screen was a brilliant idea with obviously positive results."
151,planes_trains_and_automobiles,critics,fresh,p,Martin is the straight man with Candy sliding into the buffoon role. It is a situation of perfect casting and great chemistry.
152,planes_trains_and_automobiles,critics,fresh,p,"John Hughes, the master of adolescent angst, finally has grown up. Planes, Trains and Automobiles is a hilarious comedy without troubled teen-agers."
153,planes_trains_and_automobiles,critics,fresh,p,Its expert blend of (mostly) comedy and (some) drama results in the most emotionally engaging of all John Hughes films.
154,planes_trains_and_automobiles,critics,fresh,p,A hilarious comedy from the 80s that holds up
155,planes_trains_and_automobiles,critics,fresh,p,It is honestly one of the finest comedy performances of 1980s cinema.
156,planes_trains_and_automobiles,critics,rotten,n,The movie falls into the trap of wimpy and bland sentimentality. [Full Review in Spanish]
157,planes_trains_and_automobiles,critics,fresh,p,"Mainstream audiences should readily identify with the series of tribulations and woes that befall the Everyman Martin in this good-natured, albeit predictable comedy."
158,planes_trains_and_automobiles,critics,fresh,p,"Led by the chemistry between Steve Martin and John Candy, John Hughes'Planes, Trains, and Automobiles remains a quintessential Thanksgiving classic."
159,planes_trains_and_automobiles,critics,fresh,p,It's the perfect film to see on an airplane.
160,planes_trains_and_automobiles,critics,fresh,p,A hilarious and poignant film that would prove to be particularly relevant in the upcoming years.
161,planes_trains_and_automobiles,critics,fresh,p,"Planes,Trains and Automobiles is a very funny film."
162,planes_trains_and_automobiles,critics,fresh,p,One of the funniest films ever made...
163,planes_trains_and_automobiles,critics,fresh,p,"A surprisingly powerful, and incredibly funny, little movie led by two terrific performances and John Hughes' razor sharp script."
164,planes_trains_and_automobiles,critics,fresh,p,The finest comedy screenplay John Hughes ever wrote.
165,planes_trains_and_automobiles,critics,fresh,p,
166,planes_trains_and_automobiles,critics,fresh,p,"Typically Hughes: funny, zany, silly, a little bit dull and annoying, and, eventually, a whole lot sentimental."
167,planes_trains_and_automobiles,critics,fresh,p,"Expertly executed and very funny road movie that mixes physical, verbal and situational comedy to memorable and highly likeable effect."
168,planes_trains_and_automobiles,critics,fresh,p,"A warm, mature offering from Hughes, with Martin's restraint a perfect counterpoint to Candy's enormous (and enormously amusing) fooling around."
169,planes_trains_and_automobiles,critics,rotten,n,Pretty dispensable.
170,planes_trains_and_automobiles,audience,5.0,p,John Candy and Steve Martin are perfect in this movie about the limits of tolerance when everything just keeps going wrong.  Charming and loveable.
171,planes_trains_and_automobiles,audience,3.5,p,"I'm a big fan of John Candy and yet somehow had never seen this until now. I almost watched this about six months ago but figured I'd wait til Thanksgiving.

Needless to say the expectations were of course quite high and unfortunately this lacked the nostalgia factor. I still found this a perfectly enjoyable odd couple, buddy comedy until the last 5 minutes or so, when Hughes made the film so much more meaningful. 7.5/10

Happy Thanksgiving!"
172,planes_trains_and_automobiles,audience,5.0,p,The best road trip movie in cinema.
173,planes_trains_and_automobiles,audience,4.5,p,Great movie! A must watch every Thanksgiving.
174,planes_trains_and_automobiles,audience,5.0,p,A thanksgiving classic. Another one to add to my annual holiday movie watch list.
175,planes_trains_and_automobiles,audience,5.0,p,"Planes Trains and Automobile is one of the best Thanksgiving holiday film of all and if this movie was nominated for John Candy's best supporting actor, best original screenplay and film editing and Steve Martin did really great comedic performance."
176,planes_trains_and_automobiles,audience,5.0,p,Absolutely one of my favorite movies! John Candy & Steve Martin make perfect road trip buddies. I still laugh out loud and tear up after all these years.
177,planes_trains_and_automobiles,audience,5.0,p,One of my favourite comedy films of all time!
178,planes_trains_and_automobiles,audience,5.0,p,O que dizer desse filme que é todo coração e trás aquele ar de criança ventada na sala assistindo a sessão da tarde. Filme simples e lindo
179,planes_trains_and_automobiles,audience,4.5,p,Forget Citizen Kane and Vertigo. This is the best film ever made.
180,birdcage,critics,fresh,p,It's a decent well shot film with moving & memorable performances
181,birdcage,critics,fresh,p,...a frequently hilarious comedy...
182,birdcage,critics,fresh,p,"The dialogue is sensational, the cast is perfect, the directing is sharp (by celebrated filmmaker Mike Nichols), the music is snazzy, and the film concludes quite cleverly."
183,birdcage,critics,fresh,p,"While the film occasionally drifts into stereotypes, they are typically rather harmless and Williams and Lane play off of each other perfectly."
184,birdcage,critics,fresh,p,"If you haven't seen Birdcage, check it out on video, or better yet, get gussied up and see it in a theater. Either way, realize and appreciate the very symbolic general public acceptance of the transgender phenomenon (and YOU) this film represents."
185,birdcage,critics,fresh,p,The Birdcage is a little film with knee-slapping scenes coupled with thoughtfully acute moments as well.
186,birdcage,critics,fresh,p,"The Birdcage grossed nearly $200 million worldwide in 1996, and that is significant. Box Office Mojo says it's the highest grossing queer film of all time, though they're not counting Frozen and 300, and they probably should."
187,birdcage,critics,fresh,p,"Campy, comedic romp with lots of profanity."
188,birdcage,critics,fresh,p,Robin Williams plays off of a flaming Nathan Lane with delicious understatement and anchors a farce that moves along at a brisk pace-with or without heels.
189,birdcage,critics,fresh,p,"At its core, it is about human relationships. They're extreme relationships, and they're cross-wired to get an electric reaction, but they're real characters nonetheless."
190,birdcage,critics,rotten,n,"What might be a surprise, given the talents involved, is how relentlessly unfunny it is."
191,birdcage,critics,fresh,p,"It undoubtedly remains a genial crowd pleaser. If the dress fits, wear it."
192,birdcage,critics,fresh,p,"Colourful, camp, beautifully acted and brimming with gags, Mike Nichols The Birdcage sits comfortably in Hollywood's canon of unchallenging, 'It's OK to be gay' films."
193,birdcage,critics,fresh,p,"This isn't the supreme masterpiece it might have been, but Nichols's direction is very polished and some of the lines and details are awfully funny."
194,birdcage,critics,fresh,p,"If The Birdcage isn't exactly the Mike Nichols-Elaine May movie of our dreams, it does manage to transform what was formerly a campy bit of French fluff into one of the loopiest, most hysterical family-values movies ever made."
195,birdcage,critics,fresh,p,The Birdcage is a scream.
196,birdcage,critics,rotten,n,Shows no reason why it had to be made again.
197,birdcage,critics,rotten,n,It doesn't so much champion diversity as celebrate conformity.
198,birdcage,critics,fresh,p,"If you like to laugh and laugh hard, don't miss this one. It's a genuine hoot."
199,birdcage,critics,fresh,p,
200,birdcage,audience,5.0,p,"This movie takes a heartwarming and hilarious story of a gay couple in South Beach faced against conservative soon-to-be family members when their son becomes engaged. Besides the amazing actors, the plotline is great and while it's a comedy on the surface, shows some insight to the lives of those in the LGBTQ+ community."
201,birdcage,audience,3.0,p,"I didn't buy the relationship between Robin and Nathan, just could not feel the chemistry. But I still enjoyed it and loved the classic funny moments that only the 90s could deliver. I don't think it's aged all that well with some still problematic scenes but that could just be me watching it with 2020 lenses. As they, say hindsight is 20/20."
202,birdcage,audience,5.0,p,"Still hilarious, Nathan Lane and Robin Williams are an amazing pairing. A classic rendition of a classic plot, and still resonates today."
203,birdcage,audience,5.0,p,"A perfect film with the only shortcoming being that it wasn't an hour longer. Possibly the funniest movie Williams has ever taken part it, with a plot that's wholly rewatchable, hilarious, and propped up by everyone who worked tirelessly to make it one of the best films of that decade."
204,birdcage,audience,5.0,p,This is such a feel good movie!!  Always puts a smile on my face!
205,birdcage,audience,5.0,p,"Just an all round feel good, light hearted take on a classic. Excellently performed and paced."
206,birdcage,audience,4.0,p,"The Birdcage definitely is predictable in most of its plot points, but this is a great example of a comedy where the performers elevate the material to greater heights. Hackman and Williams are excellent, but it is Lane who is here hilarious throughout. The dialogue is iconic with many classic lines while the humor has that classic screwball quality to it. It's a familiar, but fun and charming flick that was also interesting and quite important in instilling the more traditional family values into a colorful, campy surrounding."
207,birdcage,audience,1.0,n,"An interesting premise that ended up not being very interesting. I chuckled a few times but overall, it's very forgettable."
208,birdcage,audience,4.0,p,Some real comedy heavy hitters and Nathan lanes character as Albert steals the show.
209,birdcage,audience,5.0,p,"Absolutely perfect. From cast to screenplay.  One of the funniest films ever made, and it's just so loveable.  I'm always (pleasantly) surprised to find this film playing on TV on just about any station. But after all, this is about a family struggling, then ultimately hanging together."
0,existenz,critics,fresh,p,...this 1999 David Cronenberg masterpiece is one of the unheralded sci-fi classics of that decade.
1,existenz,critics,fresh,p,"Though the rigidly wonky lead performances detract from the overall impact of eXistenZ, the feature remains a fun sci-fi romp into the inquisition of reality that hinges on signature Cronenberg style."
2,existenz,critics,fresh,p,[I] thought it was good for what it was but it doesn't really beat other films I've seen like it.
3,existenz,critics,rotten,n,"As a multi-layered cautionary tale and satire, perhaps it's brilliant; but by the end, it ultimately seems like a lot of nonsense."
4,existenz,critics,fresh,p,What we have here is a witty sci-fi teaser built around the coming wave of deep immersion gaming.
5,existenz,critics,fresh,p,"It's striking that eXistenZ, a send-up of computer games that parodied The Matrix avant la lettre, and one of the great underappreciated movies of the late 1990s, yields the richest trove of relics."
6,existenz,critics,fresh,p,"Cronenberg wraps the tale in layers of mystery, never allowing the audience to confidentially comprehend precisely what is happening."
7,existenz,critics,fresh,p,"eXistenZ - both Allegra's latest beta release and David Cronenberg's dizzying B-movie - makes the different textures of game, film and life increasingly difficult to tease apart."
8,existenz,critics,fresh,p,eXistenZ is a hugely enjoyable SF thriller with a playfulness to its narrative that keeps you well and truly baffled as too where you are.
9,existenz,critics,fresh,p,"The world Cronenberg creates is his least immersive to date, but more interesting is his critique of what games and other forms of media do to our lives."
10,existenz,critics,fresh,p,"This is a David Cronenberg movie, so everything looks vaguely like a vagina."
11,existenz,critics,fresh,p,
12,existenz,critics,fresh,p,"It's a disturbing, disorienting sensation -- puzzles within puzzles, games within games -- that continues right up to the last shot."
13,existenz,critics,fresh,p,Experienced gamers should find much to savor through the films unique assessments on the nature of reality.
14,existenz,critics,fresh,p,"[Cronenberg is] a laughing existentialist here, a philosopher who sees the comedy in disorientation."
15,existenz,critics,rotten,n,"I just don't happen to like puzzle films of any kind, but I must credit Mr. Cronenberg with more intellectual depth than most of his fellow pessimistic movie pranksters."
16,existenz,critics,fresh,p,"Dark, delirious fun."
17,existenz,critics,fresh,p,
18,existenz,critics,fresh,p,
19,existenz,critics,rotten,n,It's good art direction in search of an idea.
20,existenz,audience,2.5,n,"Terribly directed acting was garbage. The promise was OK but the story was so bad it ruined the film. I stuck in till the end to see if this movie was really going somewhere, it kind of did. Definitely terrible compared to the matrix or any film. I really think total recall was one of the first and best to build this theme of not knowing if you were back in reality."
21,existenz,audience,0.5,n,"This movie took an hour and a half of my life, and I want it back."
22,existenz,audience,3.5,p,"What are those game pods, weapon fire tooth & weird gadgets? Strange weird movie with neuro serge"
23,existenz,audience,3.5,p,A bit of a gross looking mindfuck
24,existenz,audience,4.0,p,"One of the unheralded sci-fi horror classics of that 1990's decade. David Cronenberg's dizzying B-movie - is quite good with an all star cast .Gooey, slimy, grotesque ,haunting, hallucinatory attack into the philosophical and cinematic outer limits.

Some of eXistenZ is ludicrous, but as the film goes on the madness adds to a surreal trippy alternate reality. All backed up by a talented cast . Cronenberg has assembled a fascinating ensemble of players for his highly evolved game. Leigh flaunts her provocative some what sexy demeanor to good effect as Allegra, well met by Jude Law as a bodyguard who's new to playing her games. Ian Holm, and Christopher Eccleston assume shifting identities. Willem Dafoe turns up, sleek and freaky, as a grease monkey named Gas. Here, Cronenberg is working from his own original material for the first time since 1983's Videodrome. EXistenZ takes themes from Videodrome and adapts them around its own interesting concept.

""eXistenZ"" is a crude virtual reality gaming movie. Video game designer Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh) has created a virtual reality game called eXistenZ. After a crazed fan attempts to kill her, Allegra goes on the run with Ted (Jude Law), a young businessman who falls into the role of bodyguard. In an attempt to save her game, Allegra implants into Ted's body the video game pod that carries a damaged copy of eXistenZ. Allegra and Ted engage in a series of experiences that blur the lines between fantasy and reality.

Even though the execution of the movie was done with a low budget , the concept was great. Marvel at how a grotesque and visceral world can be made so vividly real and intriguing with the use of practical effects instead of computer-graphics. Cronenburg knows the value of his tactile world and is still one of the masters of body horror .The psychological depths Cronenberg reaches are mind-blowing to fathom. I've realized how much deeper this film goes. Concerned with existence, especially human existence as viewed in the theories of existentialism. A psychotropic trip."
25,existenz,audience,4.5,p,eXistenZ is a movie you have to see especially the ending!!!!
26,existenz,audience,3.5,p,"We've seen a similar set up by David Cronenberg in relation to entering alternate realities with Videodrome (1983) but eXistenZ takes themes from Videodrome and adapts them around its own interesting concept. A game designer on the run from assassins (Jennifer Jason Leigh) must play her latest virtual reality creation with marketing trainee Jude Law to determine if the game has been corrupted. There are nods to some of H.R Giger's creations (most notably famous for his design of the Alien in Ridley Scott's classic) and his somewhat sexual eye, the design of the gaming port and portal are almost laughable, presumably deliberately so. The idea of a film within a film within a film is overtly laid out, but there are enough ideas here to keep things interesting. Like Night Of The Kings, it's not entirely clear what's real and what's not, but that works in the films favour. Some of eXistenZ is ludicrous, but as the film goes on I think the madness is justified. It's no Videodrome, but eXistenZ does prove Cronenberg's brain has lost none of its originality."
27,existenz,audience,3.5,p,"Jude law is always a pleasure to watch in any kind of reality, and this movie is a fun, direct, full of twists, disgusting reality."
28,existenz,audience,4.0,p,"Totally dug this sci-fi thriller that kept me intrigued throughout and should keep the mind churning long after the credits.

I definitely felt the similarities to Inception early on which makes me more impressed that this film was released over a decade before the Nolan blockbuster. This could have also easily served as the finale on a new season of Black Mirror as the themes explored are becoming even more relevant over time."
29,existenz,audience,3.0,p,"A solid three stars. It's got all of director Cronenberg's signature elements to make for a sometimes grotesque, science-fiction movie. I like how the movie is one of those which blurs the line between reality and computer simulation, and also has a big theme of corporate greed. But Existenz could've been better too. I think it would've worked better as an action movie, rather than a thriller. Because sometimes it really feels like there isn't actually that much going on. I think it could've been much more engaging. But at least there are good actors to tell the story the way it is. Jude Law and Jennifer Jason Leigh are both good in there, although I wished that Leigh's character wasn't so bitchy sometimes. Overall, Existenz is a decent Cronenberg flick, with some flwas, not the best, but it's an interesting time waster. And to watch if you are a fan of Cronenberg's work!"
30,enemy_2013,critics,fresh,p,It's a thought-provoking film that plays on the mind for days afterwards.
31,enemy_2013,critics,fresh,p,A stylish and sinister (with a big tasty dollop of mystery on the side) that will keep audiences guessing long after they've left the theatre.
32,enemy_2013,critics,fresh,p,Perhaps more important than the conundrum at the heart of the film is the skillfully crafted feeling of perplexity.
33,enemy_2013,critics,rotten,n,Jake Gyllenhaal meets his doppelgänger - or maybe it's also him - and mostly they argue...
34,enemy_2013,critics,fresh,p,"It's a beautiful, nightmarishly warped universe ripe for multiple readings and psychological explanations concerning hidden desires and oppositions."
35,enemy_2013,critics,fresh,p,Enemy is the type of film you just can't shake.
36,enemy_2013,critics,rotten,n,"Whilst the mysterious premise and sensory illusions make for a relatively mesmeric experience, Villeneuve struggles to repress the same heavy-handedness that's been present throughout his oeuvre."
37,enemy_2013,critics,rotten,n,Enemy wants so much to be profound and provocative that it fails to ground itself in any way.
38,enemy_2013,critics,rotten,n,This movie took a lot out of me last night.
39,enemy_2013,critics,rotten,n,"I'm a huge fan of Villeneuve and Gyllenhall, but this is just not a good movie."
40,enemy_2013,critics,fresh,p,"I liked Enemy a lot. I see so many movies each year, many of which are near-clones of previous movies, that it's a treat to see a movie with an unconventional take on things, even if it's disturbing."
41,enemy_2013,critics,rotten,n,"If ""Enemy"" is the weakest of the three Villeneuve films I've seen, the problem is its reliance on gratuitous weirdness to do its heavy lifting."
42,enemy_2013,critics,rotten,n,"While the film is finely crafted and boasts excellent performances from female leads Laurent and Sarah Gadon, everything is too restrained and tasteful and, in particular, too reliant on the suspense trope of the chase."
43,enemy_2013,critics,fresh,p,"It's all style - and what wonderful, skillful style it is - with little substance."
44,enemy_2013,critics,fresh,p,"Featuring a tremendous performance by Jake Gyllenhaal and bold direction from Denis Villeneuve, Enemy is a masterfully crafted film with a tricky but very fulfilling premise."
45,enemy_2013,critics,fresh,p,"Gyllenhaal embodies both men with care, building distinct characters that no amount of physical similarity can prevent discerning who is who."
46,enemy_2013,critics,fresh,p,"For those who enjoy a different kind of cinema, this is not to be missed."
47,enemy_2013,critics,rotten,n,"As with many Gyllenhaal flicks, a huge amount goes unsaid - such as what is going on."
48,enemy_2013,critics,fresh,p,"From the opening shot of Enemy, you are trained to expect something out of the ordinary."
49,enemy_2013,critics,fresh,p,Rewarding for those who enjoy the menace and mystery that accompanies the cinema of the mind.
50,enemy_2013,audience,4.5,p,Masterfully made movie with a plot that you'll think about for years. Thanks to the amazing direction and acting by the cast which adds to this delightful movie watching experience.
51,enemy_2013,audience,4.0,p,I have no idea what I just watched.
52,enemy_2013,audience,5.0,p,This is what movies should make the us
53,enemy_2013,audience,4.0,p,"It's a strange film full of symbolism and hidden meanings. It'll have you scratching your head by the end looking for answers; but discussing the ambiguity of it all is where all the fun is. It's a film that you'll be definitely thinking about long after its over, which is a rare thing these days. Jake Gyllenhaal is fantastic and the direction from Denis Villeneuve....well he's one the the best directors working today, so you know he's good."
54,enemy_2013,audience,5.0,p,"Incredible surrealist art. This movie has depth, so don’t go in expecting spoon-fed sugar-shit-cinema."
55,enemy_2013,audience,4.5,p,"Chaos is order yet undeciphered.

Continuing Denis Villeneuve's featured length filmography with his 6th one. It doesn't take a long runtime to make one of the most complexed movie. When I watched this movie awhile ago, I had no idea what I was watching. This time tho, with some prior knowledge, I was able to see a lot of the symbolism that dictated almost every aspect of this movie. 

The theme of order and dictatorship was explicitly mentioned through the lectures from our main character. I loved how the queen spider was used to represent the themes as well as the perspectives of the main character. The monotonous and dreading color of the city and apartments further supported the themes. There were more nuances that revolves around and the theme. 

And the last shot. In the first viewing I was wildly caught off guard and became even more confused. This time it made total sense and I again adored how the plot and symbolism net together so well. 

Overall, a short yet complexed movie that require full attention. 8.5/10"
56,enemy_2013,audience,0.5,n,"Any of these would have been a better title than *Enemy*: *Bad* / *Very Bad* / *Terrible* / *Very Terrible* / *Terribly Bad* / *Bad, Not Sad, Just So Bad* / *WTF Gyllenhaal?* / *Waste 90 Minutes* / *Enemy of Entertainment* / *Watch A Different Movie*"
57,enemy_2013,audience,5.0,p,"Had me hooked from start to finish. Enemy is a tense, thought-provoking thriller that should be watched over and over again."
58,enemy_2013,audience,1.5,n,"The cons...

The dialogue, the score, the plot, the protagonist(s) arcs... they either drag like a dog's butt on the carpet, or just have no direction at all. The setting is as stale as they come. The lighting is probably 'artistic' at times... but the low lighting is a real hassle. I don't find it intriguing to have to rewind to see what's in frame. Just annoying.

This could have made a pretty decent short film (10-15 minutes) but 90? No way. 90 minutes and nothing to show for about 80 of them.

The pros...

It's somewhat mesmerizing cinematically... but worry-not, all attention you give this movie WILL be betrayed by the end. If you haven't seen this movie, I don't want to spoil it... but let me tell you, there is absolutely no payoff.

This movie sells itself as a ""figure out the meaning"" movie, but I'm convinced that's just a contrived excuse for a movie with zero actual characters in it.

Ironically, this movie is SO unmemorable that I might actually accidentally pick it up off a shelf and watch it again, forgetting that I've already seen it."
59,enemy_2013,audience,4.5,p,"[⭐️84%]

Enemy (2013) isn't a film for the average movie-goer, as it requires interpretation as well as possibly multiple rewatches. The movie has a lot of metaphors and hidden elements open to interpretation which may not please everybody, hence why reviews are so mixed.

As mentioned Enemy (2013) may require a few watches to understand its true meaning as well as some attention to detail however once achieved a truly fantastic story is displayed, helped massively by Jake Gyllenhaal. Gyllenhaal portrays two subtly different characters who can be hard to tell apart, which adds to the experience especially once the viewer understands what the story is telling.

Denis Villeneuve crafted Enemy (2013) with a lot of thought and detail which hasn't been fully appreciated by viewers, however it truly is a fascinating and engaging watch."
60,time_crimes,critics,fresh,p,"There is not a dull moment in the film and as it speeds along to its chilling climax, we can do only one thing. Watch."

64,time_crimes,critics,fresh,p,Hector's insane time-travel journey is an excellent example of high-concept sci-fi.
65,time_crimes,critics,fresh,p,"Watching ""Timecrimes"" is like stumbling in a pitch-black haunted house. Hitting walls where paths should be is fun, and time-travel tropes of choice versus fate are inventively goosed. Even with five minutes left, it could conclude in any number of ways."
66,time_crimes,critics,fresh,p,"The idyllic but mundane world of the film's opening segues smoothly into a sequence out of a highly intelligent slasher film, before finally settling into its niche as a darkly funny, and at times mildly disturbing, sci-fi thriller."
67,time_crimes,critics,fresh,p,That rarest of rare things: an intelligent time-travel movie that actually holds together on closer examination.
68,time_crimes,critics,fresh,p,"While I enjoyed the film a great deal, I honestly wonder if there'd be this amount of hoopla if the picture, say, starred a yamhead like Val Kilmer and was set in New Jersey."
69,time_crimes,critics,fresh,p,"A smart, occasionally thrilling science fiction tale..."
70,time_crimes,critics,fresh,p,A tight little movie where every setup is paid off

72,time_crimes,critics,fresh,p,Very cool.
73,time_crimes,critics,fresh,p,"The key here is to keep things moving without letting the logical (or illogical) complications weigh down the action, and [director] Vigalondo does this well."
74,time_crimes,critics,fresh,p,"Nacho Vigalondo's bleak time-travel thriller... [chronicles the travails of a] classic film noir schmuck: No matter what he does, sooner or later fate will stick out her foot and trip him up."
75,time_crimes,critics,fresh,p,His film is satisfying in its clever construction and vivid style.
76,time_crimes,critics,fresh,p,The first feature by a promising young director who doesn't know how to recapture the hare he has let loose.
77,time_crimes,critics,fresh,p,A film that exemplifies the popular artistic notion of inescapable tragic destiny.
78,time_crimes,critics,fresh,p,"An enterprising Spanish time-travel thriller, that's light on DeLoreans and lightning bolts, but heavy on fiendish cross-currents of temporal interaction."
79,time_crimes,critics,fresh,p,"Meticulous plotting, breathless pacing, paradoxes aplenty, and some surprisingly human dilemmas, all make this low-key sci-fi thriller well worth going back over again and again. It is a Primer-like triumph of ideas over budget."
80,time_crimes,audience,3.0,p,"Timecrimes features a well-constructed, complicated yet coherent plot that successfully satirizes the time-travel genre. However, the protagonist is so unlikable, and the other characters are so one-dimensional, that it's difficult to become emotionally invested in the story. Recommended primarily for time-travel aficionados."
81,time_crimes,audience,5.0,p,One of the most coherent time travel movies!
82,time_crimes,audience,4.0,p,"Middle-aged suburban ordinariness, until he sees the girl taking her top off - his voyeurism kicks it all off. Time travel and if he'd just do what he was asked, none of it would happen - but he's Joe Schmo - who messes it up. It gets darker and darker as he tries to fix it. It's all there as you watch it go horribly wrong. Tight setting, a plot that never over-convolutes and just a clever, intelligent little film."
83,time_crimes,audience,1.5,n,"The main character was such a moronic, unlikable psychopath, that it became hard to watch. This movie falls into that category of movies where everything could have been easily solved if the characters just talked for 5 minutes but no, that's not an option for the main character whoo couldn't see any way to 'fix' this problem outside of murder and sexual assault, so...

Anyway, Colossal is really good, so Vigalondo could clearly do better, and he did, thankfully."
84,time_crimes,audience,5.0,p,Takes your to wild ride that goes the extra mile.
85,time_crimes,audience,3.0,p,"Oh my God the time traveler in this movie is an idiot! Do as the time machine guys says and DON'T GO ANYWHERE FOR ONE HOUR. But nope, he's gotta go meddle with the timeline and create multiple versions of himself and events. 

I'm a sucker for time travel flicks, and for a very low budget Spanish import, it was fairly entertaining, but check out the much better ""Predestination"" instead if you haven't seen it."
86,time_crimes,audience,3.5,p,"Though characters make some questionable choices, Timecrimes is a mostly smart and enjoyable sci-fi thriller."
87,time_crimes,audience,1.5,n,"Interesante película que, con bajo presupuesto, logra articular una thriller de suspenso que interroga sobre las paradojas del viaje en el tiempo, y la (im)posibilidad de cambiar el pasado. Sin embargo, se ve muy opacada por una subtrama de abuso y asesinato que nada aporta a la historia, que -afortunadamante- no ha envejecido nada de bien, y que hoy funciona como registro del más explícito y burdo machismo en el cine."
88,time_crimes,audience,4.0,p,"Vigalondo's acting is not the best, Elejalde's acting is not his best, but their chemistry, the script and directing make you forget about anything wrong productionwise and let you enjoy this low-budget gem."
89,time_crimes,audience,5.0,p,An intriguing story this thriller is an interesting movie
90,mr_nobody,critics,fresh,p,"The plot, dealing with a branching personal timeline, is intricately complex yet masterfully coherent, despite what a few overworked film critics have written."
91,mr_nobody,critics,fresh,p,"Daring sci-fi with mature themes, sex, and violence."
92,mr_nobody,critics,rotten,n,"[Writer-director] Van Dormael seems unsure of what exactly it is he's trying to say, and thus Mr. Nobody rambles on for nearly two and a half hours."
93,mr_nobody,critics,rotten,n,"There are times when the film is entirely lucid in the points it wants to get across on love and the various choices we have to make throughout our lives, while at other times it seems lost in its overabundance of possibilities."
94,mr_nobody,critics,rotten,n,"Too clinical to have an emotional impact, not romantic enough to engage a standard audience, and not smart enough for viewers looking for an intellectual experience."
95,mr_nobody,critics,fresh,p,ambitious as all get out and a wonder from start to finish.
96,mr_nobody,critics,fresh,p,"While visual excess and occasional thematic bombast softens Mr. Nobody at times, the film nevertheless has poignant, often profound things to say about fate, mortality, consequence and love."
97,mr_nobody,critics,fresh,p,"a passionate, thoughtful, and inquisitive exploration of the meaning of life."
98,mr_nobody,critics,fresh,p,Never mind that several characters seem to gain or lose British accents throughout the course of the film. The lack of continuity only enhances the sense of deliciously dizzying disequilibrium.
99,mr_nobody,critics,fresh,p,"As philosophy, Mr. Nobody seems sillier than it is profound. But in a parallel reality, more movies would have this degree of insane ambition."
100,mr_nobody,critics,rotten,n,"At the 44-minute mark (I checked) of 'Mr. Nobody,' I loudly sighed and asked, ""Good God, when the hell is this movie going to START!"""
101,mr_nobody,critics,fresh,p,"A thoughtful investigation into the different variations of all our lives: the daydreams, the anxious worst-case scenarios, the futile digressions that went nowhere."
102,mr_nobody,critics,fresh,p,"Too strange for wide release, too provocative and arresting to sit on the shelf"
103,mr_nobody,critics,fresh,p,"This sprawling, ambitious sci-fi epic has a keen visual sense and a genuine interest in its deep topics."
104,mr_nobody,critics,rotten,n,The only truly graspable notion the film can be said to put forth is one of increasingly tedious sci-fi-romantic genre busy-ness.
105,mr_nobody,critics,fresh,p,Jaco van Dormael's most ambitious film to date is a mess and a miracle at the same time.
106,mr_nobody,critics,fresh,p,This big-budget English-language co-production shows that Europeans can compete in the sci-fi realm where high production values are king.
107,mr_nobody,critics,rotten,n,"The aptly titled Nobody is just a white ball bouncing around the roulette wheel, as likely to land on this number as the next. It's fun to watch ""Mr. Nobody"" go round and round, but where it lands doesn't really matter to us."
108,mr_nobody,critics,fresh,p,Messy but intriguing science-fiction film.
109,mr_nobody,critics,fresh,p,"Most viewers will have settled into a state of detached admiration. In the end, Mr. Nobody's title is simply too apt."
110,mr_nobody,audience,3.5,p,"It takes effort to watch, it's too long for how little coherent message it has to transmit, but there's something enjoyable about the style of it that doesn't allow me to take it down to a 6/10."
111,mr_nobody,audience,4.5,p,"Spoilers: What? Sort of epistemology meets cinematography meets astrophysics meets all you need is love meets Alice in Wonderland meets Benjamin Button. The joke is that at 118, evolutionary humanity-science-medical technology has made this guy the last mortal, which means Nemo's time has run out, but at the end, time has reversed so he gets the last laugh because his time ain't up after all. Sheese. The epistemological question is the key: How do we know, how do we know what we know, and are we kidding ourselves about knowing anything? Any piece with Jared, Diane, Sarah, Juno, Rhys, Natasha can't be all bad and they all delivered. So just when the human race figures they have it licked and nobody dies, all of reality going back to the Big Bang and forward may well reverse at some point and time may reverse, too, changing everything yet again. Putting all this thought into film, making it coherent was quite a challenge, and the coherence frequently devolved into chaos, which was the plan. So, in the end, it was fine to focus on Jared at his many jumbled ages, because we can relate to a guy's experience, comparing it to our own. So what is the point of the exercise? Is it just nobody knows much? So what do we do? Not all that much till it ends, which it probably will end -- or not. The moral of the story is Slaughterhouse Fiive-ish, as Billy Pilgrim hangs onto Montana Wildhack (Valerie Perrine) on Tralfamador in perpetuity. Nemo hangs onto the one captivating phenomenon that he was drawn to most in life: Anna. An eternity with Diane Kruger ain't a bad way to go. Better than digging a ditch. Maybe Lennon had it right when he sang: ""I just believe in me, Yoko and me -- that's reality."" Gotta look in awe at the creativity here, Van Dormael up with von Trier and others of the most imaginative, daring and gutsy filmmakers. We didn't know from minute to minute what was going to happen next in this one, reality mixing with wishes, dreams and hopes. Hey, ain't that life? Not sure how they cobbled together the dough to even film this. Way better than Every Movie, Sequel 9. This is art house fare, surely for filmophiles, as you have to bring a lot to it, and uses the title ironically, as Nemo is not nobody, he is somebody we kinda like, as all of us are somebody, but it leaves open the  possibility that he really is nobody, and us too, just to emphasize the weakness of all our definitions in such a vast and incomprehensible time and space continuum as is this universe or multiverse, 14 billion or so years old."
112,mr_nobody,audience,4.0,p,"I had to watch the movie three times before I began to understand it! I am a physics major and the ideas of time and space are hot topics of physicists. The ideas in this movie are as if Back to the Future and The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind were shmushed together. The lead character, Nemo/Mr. Nobody lives different lives in many timelines. One minute he's old and the next he's young; he's living with one girl and simultaneously living with another girl. The movie follows him through his different lives. That's what 'new physics' says - that there are many worlds, each with its own events. I guess if I'm living in another universe, I'm not writing this review. I'm dancing at my wedding. I doubt this movie will appeal to many people - they'll feel lost - like, what the heck's going on? But if you let your mind accept that maybe we all live many lives, you can enjoy the movie. The more I watched it, the more I liked it."
113,mr_nobody,audience,3.0,p,When will this movie never end?  And why must protagonists always have long hair and make them look a girl.  Sorry but I could not sit this one out!!!
114,mr_nobody,audience,4.0,p,"This is an amazing film, if you can find the time and, mostly, the attention required to fully enjoy it. Also, it demands multiple viewings. It's certainly not meant for the casual moviegoer, but for those who like non-linear and complex storytelling. Also, the  original soundtrack by Pierre Van Dormael is absolutely moving."
115,mr_nobody,audience,3.0,p,"This might be a movie that needs to be watched twice, but the bottom line is the non-linear timeline lacks clarity. Otherwise, it raises some great questions about mortality and paints an enjoyable picture of chaos theory."
116,mr_nobody,audience,5.0,p,A movie tailored for every professional liar with an identity crisis.
117,mr_nobody,audience,3.5,p,"In that family of films where you need to read an explanation on what it's about before seeing it. Either that, or watch it twice with the explanation in-between. Love the ambitious reach and it's pretty well done."
118,mr_nobody,audience,3.5,p,"It is hard to follow, but very interesting and worth a watch."
119,mr_nobody,audience,5.0,p,Great film. Kept me interested the entire time and it made me horny for love.
120,predestination,critics,fresh,p,"This twisting, turning, time-travelling thriller about the ability to change the course of destiny will leave you pondering long after the credits have rolled."
121,predestination,critics,fresh,p,"Challenges the ultimate impossibility with themes of existence, procreation, choices, destiny, and whether the end justifies the means...a 360-degree head scratcher. And the word ""360-degree"" will have a new meaning when you realize the full story."
122,predestination,critics,fresh,p,"Never what you expect, Predestination can become something of a narrative jumble, but it's always compelling to watch, and the landscape continually shifts beneath your feet."
123,predestination,critics,fresh,p,"Perhaps more ambitious than its means, it's a film that manages to intrigue and engross with a narrative that virtually creates the odor of the musty, yellowed pages of the writing style it's been borrowed from."
124,predestination,critics,rotten,n,Forget four dimensions; Predestination struggles to break out of two.
125,predestination,critics,fresh,p,"...a notably imaginative film noir that craftily elevates the genre into an alluring confection. Dark, moody and visibly challenging, Predestination gleefully plots and twists its way into a hearty submission of inspired Science Fiction contemplation."
126,predestination,critics,fresh,p,"In a way, Snook is the heart of Predestination... and by the time the film ends, you'll realize it is a strong and beautiful one."
127,predestination,critics,fresh,p,"This yarn - based on sci-fi legend Robert Heinlein's short story All You Zombies - is never less than intriguing, even if it does threaten to unravel at the slightest tug on a thread of loose logic."
128,predestination,critics,fresh,p,"Very smart writing and editing, and a rare film to get time travel right."
129,predestination,critics,fresh,p,"For a faithful adaptation of a short story, the film is packed with plot twists and narrative surprises and the challenge faced by the Spierig Brothers is obscuring details that would give away the twists without making it obvious."
130,predestination,critics,fresh,p,"This is cerebral sci-fi with a strong emotional undertow, largely thanks to Snook, who gives a heart-tugging performance as the gender-addled person of mystery."
131,predestination,critics,fresh,p,Trippy sci-fi thriller.
132,predestination,critics,fresh,p,"A largely faithful adaptation of a 1958 Robert A. Heinlein short story, Michael and Peter Spierig's Predestination is a time-travel yarn that worked fine as a 13-page read, but as a film the time-bendy elements come across as sub-Primer at best."
133,predestination,critics,fresh,p,"Hawks and Snook's performances pack a surprising emotional punch, and even if you spot the film's big twist coming you will still want to watch it all over again to spot all the deftly placed clues."
134,predestination,critics,fresh,p,"Sarah Snook gives an immaculate, wholly-formed Star Is Born performance of the first order."
135,predestination,critics,fresh,p,"Perhaps the best adaptation to date of a story written by science fiction legend Robert A. Heinlein. This is a very complex story and it is handled well by The Spierig Brothers, who co-wrote and co-directed the film."
136,predestination,critics,fresh,p,"... packs a powerful emotional punch thanks to its sensitive treatment of emotive themes and an incredible, multi-layered performance from Sarah Snook."
137,predestination,critics,fresh,p,"Had this been any more sincere or stony-faced it simply wouldn't work, instead thriving in the frivolity of it all."
138,predestination,critics,fresh,p,"The film leaps into a dizzy abyss of temporal paradoxes, made all the dizzier by its transgender premise - a modern Tiresias myth plaited into a Möbius strip."
139,predestination,critics,fresh,p,"A thoughtful, if wonky, small-scale epic of retro-futurism."
140,predestination,audience,5.0,p,"It's like The Endless - it's a never-ending, closed loop where all the fullness of a life is lived over and over again. We - the audience - see just one iteration, but I imagine this film plays on repeat for eternity. It is a Hell into which the players play their part with full knowledge of the futility of their hopes and desires, but what else can they do but play their part. 

Along with Primer, this is the best iteration of time travel put to film. While Primer focuses on mathematical precision and limitations of physics, this movie explores the deep suffering that time travel entails. To me, it is a thoughtful, melancholy expression of the hopes we all have in the face of the meaninglessness of choice and actions in our lives. We will  choose what we have always choosen, because it is the only choice that is possible. The pain and suffering that comes from it is simply woven into the nature of existence."
141,predestination,audience,2.5,n,"5.0/10 — ""Poor""/""Inferior""/""Amateurish"""
142,predestination,audience,5.0,p,"This is a time-travel story combined with a three word insult taken quite literally.

It's a pretzel that turns into a snake eating its own tale by violating the most basic rule of time travel stories.

To say much more would give away more than one great twist."
143,predestination,audience,5.0,p,"The story gets going at half time. Just after you think it's so bad, you want to turn it off. Hang in there. 
It's worth it in the end - absolute mindf1ck!!!"
144,predestination,audience,4.0,p,"Even watching this a second time, knowing what was going to happen, this sucked me in.  I had the weird feeling I was watching Edward Furlong, even though I knew that was not the case.  The plot is a twisted pretzel and a half.  There were points along the way I didn't follow what was going on - especially the motivational stuff, but it was clear and coherent enough to make for a compelling story."
145,predestination,audience,4.0,p,"This movie was suggested to me. When I asked for a very light description I was told ""the best description of this movie is 'what happens when someone tells you to go f**k yourself"". After watching I do understand. It is so twisty and keeps u guessing. When you think you got it, you dont. Well written and cast. Good pace and atmosphere. One of those you cant watch twice. But you want to watch someone else watch it."
146,predestination,audience,4.0,p,A film without no sense for a script with total sense. Good work of Sarah Snook and Ethan Hawke. My claps to the best time travel's movie that i ever seen. 8/10
147,predestination,audience,4.0,p,"Intrigante, los hilos del tiempo tejen una telaraña. Simplemente apagar el cerebro de la logica y disfrutar la aventura sci-fi. Excelentes actuaciones. De esas pelis que te gustaria no saber el final, para repetir la sensacion de descubrirlo (vistas 2)"
148,predestination,audience,4.0,p,Well worth a watch. It will keep you thinking about the movie well after it has finished. Pace could've been a little better.
149,predestination,audience,1.0,n,"Caveat - didn't watch the full movie as too irritated. Husband and I chose the movie on Netflix and I was expecting a time travel crime movie: forty minutes in and we've had ten minutes of a good introduction followed by a thirty minute sob story about an androgynous orphan that just goes on, and on, and on and I just did.not.care. Presumably there's a pay off later to justify such a risk with the story pacing, but I didn't have the interest to find out."
150,time_lapse_2015,critics,fresh,p,"a clever, low-budget genre flick with more ideas than money."
151,time_lapse_2015,critics,fresh,p,"Even so, among the many inexpensive indies shot around Los Angeles, Time Lapse stands out. It makes the most of its assets and never appearing to need any more than it has to tell a reasonably engrossing tale of speculative film noir."
152,time_lapse_2015,critics,fresh,p,"Competently acted and directed, Time Lapse isn't a cinematic revelation, but it does see the future-a sobering picture of the future of today's young people, flailing in a society that seems to give them limited options."
153,time_lapse_2015,critics,fresh,p,"While ultimately a flawed film, Time Lapse does do what every memorable sci-fi brainteaser should: it makes you blind to the obvious."
154,time_lapse_2015,critics,rotten,n,It's ultimately difficult not to feel more than a little disappointed by Time Lapse's complete failure...
155,time_lapse_2015,critics,rotten,n,"Its central gimmick runs out of steam pretty quickly, causing the story logic to crumble and the suspense to dwindle."
156,time_lapse_2015,critics,fresh,p,Discovering a neighbor's photographic time machine complicates life for three young L.A. flatmates in this clever fantasy thriller.
157,time_lapse_2015,critics,fresh,p,A great little sci-fi gem that plays with time paradoxes while adding elements of a self-contained paranoia thriller.
158,time_lapse_2015,critics,fresh,p,The biggest surprise ... is how the story continues to unsettle after it ends.
159,time_lapse_2015,critics,rotten,n,"The three central actors lack warmth or even basic rapport from the start, which makes it difficult to trust their fuzzy interpretation of the time-travel rules-or, for that matter, their tolerance for each other."
160,time_lapse_2015,critics,fresh,p,"A relatively contained three-hander, the main leads all deliver strong performances that are engaging and add to the tension."
161,time_lapse_2015,critics,rotten,n,Flat performances make this time-travel by Polaroid thriller flatline.
162,time_lapse_2015,critics,fresh,p,"What was a rather pedestrian ""Twilight Zone"" episode may have inspired this nice little fantasy thriller. That makes it well above average for time travel films."
163,time_lapse_2015,critics,fresh,p,"A nifty little cross between Primer and Shallow Grave, with a central MacGuffin that manages to maintain its plausibility until the credits roll."
164,time_lapse_2015,critics,fresh,p,Bradley King's Time Lapse turns run-of-the-mill roommate friction into a heated mystery with the aid of a machine that takes snapshots of the near future.
165,time_lapse_2015,critics,fresh,p,"Time Lapse is a funky little time-travel thriller that blends single-setting suspense with sci-fi tension, and despite some fuzzy logic, it makes for a surprisingly neat watch."
166,time_lapse_2015,critics,fresh,p,"The film becomes somewhat overwrought during its busy finale, but it's clever enough to be a candidate for cult status among genre aficionados who prize the pleasures of traditional storytelling."
167,time_lapse_2015,critics,fresh,p,"a paradox-filled, reflexive plot"
168,time_lapse_2015,audience,3.5,p,"Time Lapse features an extraordinarily clever plot about time and causality that holds up to scrutiny. It also generates genuine suspense. For me, these positives are enough to outweigh glaring problems of characterization, particularly the implausible ways characters react to discovering a fortune-telling camera."
169,time_lapse_2015,audience,5.0,p,This has to be one of the most screwed up movies I have ever seen. I absolutely loved it!
170,time_lapse_2015,audience,3.0,p,"the premise is interesting enough to keep your attention. however, seems more like a wasted concept that was executed poorly. still received some enjoyment nonetheless."
171,time_lapse_2015,audience,3.0,p,"Great concept and ‘time travel' movie, ‘time travel' is a bit of a hobby of mine, I've been of the borrowed belief for well over a decade that cameras and photographs make people believe they are quicker than they really are... unless you're me, then cameras and photographs make everyone think they are quicker than you."
172,time_lapse_2015,audience,3.5,p,"Um filme que sabe usar o tempo de maneira inventiva e interessante, te prende fazendo querer ver a cena seguinte e quando pensa saber o motivo dos conflitos, mostra q era outro o tempo todo, a certos momentos q poderiam terminará rápido, um filme simples q rende um ótimo entretenimento usando viagem no tempo de um jeito diferente e muito bom."
173,time_lapse_2015,audience,3.0,p,"It was a cool concept written well, but overall the script & acting were super corny. I enjoyed it, but I know I would've enjoyed it so much more in middle school."
174,time_lapse_2015,audience,2.5,n,"Liked the cast, the premise was also a pretty good one, but for me it didnt find its footing until close to the end."
175,time_lapse_2015,audience,3.5,p,It's worth a watch but I'd say there was an initial error in how Jasper manages to figure out which dogs to bet on. It would of made sense had there been a TV in the background of the future picture with the actual results being broadcast. He would not of been able to provide those for himself in the manner the movie depicted. Other than that though the movie was pretty good.
176,time_lapse_2015,audience,3.0,p,it is good as a new  idea of a movie but I no understand the end
177,time_lapse_2015,audience,3.5,p,"A very cool, concept, however it is only the concept that drives the movie forward.  There is a lack of believability in the personal interactions between the three main characters and their explanations of the various time paradoxes, and resulting actions.  Such a low budget movie of this genre requires a tighter script, direction and editing to really make it work."
178,the_cell_2000,critics,fresh,p,Tarsem Singh's vision in The Cell is unparalleled. It's a truly stunning and gnarly piece of work.
179,the_cell_2000,critics,rotten,n,"I, myself, was both impressed and appalled by the film. And I thought, ""If this filmmaker can ever put his extravagant visual sense to good use within a real story, he will really have something to offer."""
180,the_cell_2000,critics,fresh,p,"""The Cell"" is not for everyone, but some will find it a portal to some extraordinary sights."
181,the_cell_2000,critics,rotten,n,"It's eye candy, all right, but lacks any nutritional value."
182,the_cell_2000,critics,fresh,p,A must-see for fans of dark psychological thrillers.
183,the_cell_2000,critics,rotten,n,"Jazzy photography and fancy design in no way compensate for a dull, suspense-free screenplay and unwise casting."
184,the_cell_2000,critics,rotten,n,"Even if ""The Cell"" doesn't stand up to deep examination, it's nevertheless a strongly engrossing thriller that delivers ample chills and thrills with its hellish, Hieronymus Bosch-like images alone."
185,the_cell_2000,critics,rotten,n,The Cell is Hollywood at its most meretricious.
186,the_cell_2000,critics,rotten,n,"""The Cell"" looks spectacular. If only it never opened its mouth."
187,the_cell_2000,critics,rotten,n,"Ultimately, the reliance on a dream world tends to reduce suspense and even narrative logic. Thus, everything is possible and nothing is necessary."
188,the_cell_2000,critics,fresh,p,This is not your father's sci-fi thriller.
189,the_cell_2000,critics,fresh,p,"The stylised sections occasionally sit uncomfortably within the generic thriller framework. That said, this remains an often dazzling showcase for his imagination."
190,the_cell_2000,critics,rotten,n,"The story's not clever or scary so much as it is unpleasant and grisly with scenes of stabbings, an evisceration, and other such lovely excesses."
191,the_cell_2000,critics,rotten,n,The Cell is pretty silly. But I admired its cinematic ambition until the final scenes.
192,the_cell_2000,critics,rotten,n,"The summer's silliest cinematic experience has to be The Cell, ostensibly a slightly futuristic serial killer movie but, subtextually, a commercial for the Saatchi collection."
193,the_cell_2000,critics,fresh,p,"Like [anyone's] imagination, the movie's landscape is littered with half-remembered pop artifacts... what's different is that Tarsem, a commercial and video director here making his feature debut, sticks the protagonists in a garden of unearthly delights."
194,the_cell_2000,critics,rotten,n,"The deeper the movie goes into its characters' heads, the more it finds shallow, familiar scenes of sexual domination and submission"
195,the_cell_2000,critics,rotten,n,"If you thought virtual-reality thrillers and spin-offs of The Silence of the Lambs had run their course, guess again."
196,the_cell_2000,critics,rotten,n,"Almost worth seeing because there's nothing else like it, it's also easy to wish there never will be again."
197,the_cell_2000,critics,fresh,p,Rewarding even beyond the shockingly bold images that almost exclusively make up the film's final hour and change.
198,the_cell_2000,audience,5.0,p,"One of the truly great visual masterpieces. 
A stunning film, the story and the way its told is magical and horrifying.

Watch if you like aesthetically beautiful films. (I also happen to think its good regardless of the beauty)"
199,the_cell_2000,audience,3.0,p,"A rip off from another movie by Roger Zelanzy the ""Dream Master""!!!"
200,the_cell_2000,audience,3.5,p,"It's a shame the audience score doesn't reflect this hidden gem of a crime thriller. The Cell is a criminally underrated film highlighted by the brilliant performance of the always consistent Vincent D'Onofrio. Director Tarsem Singh comes from the world of music videos (along with David Fincher, Anton Corbijn, Mark Romanek, Michael Gondry...) and The Cell plays like a 2-hour music video that is both visually stunning and truly uncomfortable. And that is where some of the best art always comes from: pure discomfort. A gorgeous looking film."
201,the_cell_2000,audience,5.0,p,I love how the average Joe think they're a spectacular critic. Millenials are funny! No sense of depth. Real art.
202,the_cell_2000,audience,3.5,p,"although, except for Onofrio, the acting is awful, this movie has a astonishing photography and art, symbolically is intriguing and accurate."
203,the_cell_2000,audience,5.0,p,Very underrated movie. It was ahead for his time. This is a visual masterpiece with a good plot. Tarsem is a wonderful director who gave us this amazin experience. This is not a great story. It's more like a no-sense trip that lets you find the sense.
204,the_cell_2000,audience,5.0,p,"One of my favorite horror/thrillers of all time. This movie needs to be reevaluated. A visual masterpiece. Jennifer Lopez is amazing, as always! A cult classic!"
205,the_cell_2000,audience,3.5,p,"Lush visuals and D'Onofrio's performance prevent this from being just another thriller. While not without its faults, it excels at what it tries to accomplish. Presenting the cinematic version of anyone's psyche surely presents problems but it's done here in a way that's restrained yet striking."
206,the_cell_2000,audience,4.0,p,"The real story is about the serial killer himself, showing what we see at first as a monster starts off as an innocent person. How severe abuse can overcome and fill a person with darkness until it takes complete control of them. A sliver of his humanity remains, but it is powerless against the monster that has grown out of him. It doesn't ask us to forgive the murderer, but rather to understand that no one is born evil. Evil infects, spreading from person to person, abusers passing it on to the abused. 
It is a story about isolation, fear, depravity and mercy."
207,the_cell_2000,audience,2.5,n,"It’s an interesting premise, and fun enough to explore the possibilities. As with any movie that delves into pseudo-psycho-science, there’s not really any consistency in the rules of how things work, so you get the sense that it might be just a vehicle for Tarsem Singh to have fun with his visual style. He definitely has vision, but the serial-killer/detective narrative is clearly not his strong suit - it relied on a lot of cliches. Still looked cool, though."

21,1089671-13th_floor,audience,4.5,p,"Great movie! It was overshadowed by the Matrix which came out around the same time and appealed to a younger crowd. That probably caused this gem to be overlooked. This was more of a murder mystery with a film noir computer generated city. It kept you engrossed with the idea of being able to interact in a computer generated enviornment, much like being on the holodek in Star Trek The Next Generation. I actually liked it better than the Matrix."

But if you take the movie as it is and just enjoy it as it is at face value then it is hard to do better.  One of my favourites! Get comfortable, concentrate, pay a bit of attention and you will enjoy."
25,1089671-13th_floor,audience,4.0,p,"Great plot - just needed a bit of polish. An A-list actor would have made this a big hit.
Ignore the critics who think this is confusing - if you love sci-fi it will be interesting."
26,1089671-13th_floor,audience,4.0,p,"Much like Primer, The Thirteenth Floor is densely packed and doesn't waste time dragging the audience along, space out at your own peril. A noir-esque amnesia/murder mystery is the vehicle for a great sci-fi thought experiment. The studio did The Thirteenth Floor no favors releasing a month after The Matrix, but The Thirteenth Floor is a much more nuanced look at the idea of virtual worlds and their consequences on reality. An excellent film that shines brighter than it's small budget should allow, strongly recommended."
27,1089671-13th_floor,audience,5.0,p,All the finest thoughts that went to create The Matrix are present in this movie. I think there is some connection between the two.
28,1089671-13th_floor,audience,4.0,p,"The history and the plot is quite good, it makes you think about the reality"
29,1089671-13th_floor,audience,1.5,n,"The Thirteenth Floor has a premise that should hook me from the beginning. Not only does it set up a sci-fi concept where people are entering a virtual reality simulation, but then it sets off a complex murder mystery that seems to blend together things going on inside and outside of that computer-generated world. But this movie had a host of problems. First of all, it requires a lot of people to behave in completely ridiculous ways in order to keep the story going. Frequently, I was looking at the screen wondering why a character was doing something, which means it’s not even meeting the bare minimum requirements for a decent plot. There needs to be a reason people act in a certain way that I can justify through some combination of knowing their characters, and common human nature. The story also features a deus ex machina of sorts that is terribly contrived. Another difficulty that The Thirteenth Floor has to deal with, through no fault of its own, is existing in a post-Matrix world. I know this movie only came out a handful of months after that amazing film, so I assume it’s not a copycat, because it would have been in the process of being made long before The Matrix was released. But it covers some of the same thematic ground and does it in an inferior way. While I’d love to say that a handful of tweaks to the script and ignorance towards The Matrix would be enough to make The Thirteenth Floor good, it’s simply not true. There’s one more thing that was probably the biggest problem with this film...the cast. I’ll take Armin Mueller-Stahl and Vincent D’Onofrio all day, even though the latter is playing his roles a bit exaggerated. But Craig Bierko and Gretchen Mol are painfully bad. Just watching their awkward facial expressions and flat line delivery was enough to make me laugh out loud more than once. There was even one scene where I felt like they learned their lines phonetically because it was like watching two aliens fumbling through words despite the fact that they didn’t understand them. I could not even begin to get invested in a relationship between these two wax statues masquerading as actors. The unintentional comedy was off the charts, and it only got funnier when Bierko was given an opportunity to play a different personality. I was almost embarrassed for him when he played the villain for a moment. There is so much wrong with The Thirteenth Floor despite the fact that the idea has a lot of promise. And I hate that I was ahead of the film the entire way through because it was so predictable."

His uncompromising perspective on death, time and identity are what stand out most about Synecdoche, New York. While this movie may not be the easiest watch for most, if you really take the time to understand what is being expressed, not only within each scene, but throughout the entire film, you will find deep and brutal honesty."

This film is quite possibly the greatest dive into existential nihilism ever seen on the big screen.

For a film that, towards its conclusion, purports that it could well be about everyone, there sure was a lack of diversity of perspective.

85,paprika,audience,4.5,p,"To dream is to die, to wish for the ego-death and subjective oblivion that comes like a thief in the night, when consciousness gives up the ghost. In films, when the pitch black of a theater subsumes us and the kaleidoscopic fantasy overwhelms our senses, we die a little and so we dream a little—but we are forced to dream another person's vision, which in terms of this particular film a form of oneiric terrorism. Hence one person's dream (the filmmaker's) is another person's (the audience's) nightmare, and one person's (the viewer's) death is another person's (the director's) lifework. Life, too, is a but a dream, after all, the collective hallucination and cumulative imagination of scientists and artists, a cascade of inspiration unbound by language or time or space or intention—and so not so different from a sort of collective unconscious lived out not in sleep but in waking (albeit barely so) society. Hence all that is reality first began as a dream and all that is a dream (der Inhalt) was, likewise, once reality; condensed and displaced through the work of the Other/the Symbolic, the world of the day becomes the world of the night and the realms of our revelries will, through the work of other people, turn real again in turn."

Dennis Quaid is not a good actor and this movie shows off those talents.  Max Von Sydow and Christopher Plummer help keep this movie together, but this is not a must see movie from the 80's."
111,dreamscape,audience,4.0,p,"A interesting and trippy movie This Thriller is a hidden gem that I would recommend to people who like Sc-Fi, Adventure and even people don't really like horror movies can get enjoyment out of it"
112,dreamscape,audience,3.5,p,"Christopher Plummer is a very good at being bad.
In the 1984 film, Dreamscape, Plummer is Bob Blair, the head of a covert intelligence agency. He's also the head of a project where talented psychics enter other people's dreams to help them confront their worst nightmares. The late Max Von Sydow and Kate Capshaw are part of the project. They recruit Dennis Quaid's Alex Gardner. 

Quaid spends a lot of time running in the film. 

There's a chase scene where Quaid is running from agents. He grabs a dirt bike and rides across a horse race track.

David Patrick Kelly from The Warriors, among other roles, is pretty cold as Plummer's main enforcer. He's like a psychic Oddjob from Goldfinger.

The special effects are all '80's - they're dated. The cast is quite talented. There are a few leaps in logic, but the story is pretty decent."
113,dreamscape,audience,3.0,p,Great cast in a low budget movie that's not worth the price of admission unfortunately.
114,dreamscape,audience,3.0,p,"Between 2.5 and 3 stars. It has a powerful idea, but only scractches it (in opposition to whcih, years later, Inception will do)"
115,dreamscape,audience,4.0,p,"Underrated genre bending 80s movie with a young Dennis Quaid in full form playing his usual smirky good guy role that made his fortune throughout the decade.
Stellar cast including Max von Sydow and Kate Capshaw, but is David Patrick Kelly performance as murderous villain and his interplay with Quaid that really shines in the movie. Joseph Ruben directs with capable hand and handles surprisingly well a crowded plot line that mixes elements of sci fi-horror and action thriller with a comedic vibe. Imagine a very successful mix of David Cronenberger and Chris Columbus. Such efforts allow the self-indulgence of the special effects to get a pass."
116,dreamscape,audience,2.5,n,"Dennis Quaid played the same guy in all of his early work: smirking jock. Here that character has psychic abilities that allow him to smirk and to enter dreams just in time to save The President (Eddie Albert, pocketing an easy paycheck) from his bad dreams. Max von Sydow and Christopher Plummer, hearing that easy paychecks we're being giving out, stop by to get theirs too, why not? This could have been more, but it isn't, so what?"
117,dreamscape,audience,4.0,p,An 80's journey into the psyche and imagination. Completely B-movie material but fun. Not as fun as They Live! And probably won't hold the attention of a millennial or GenY. But maybe nostalgic for GenX who enjoyed the campy 80s.
118,dreamscape,audience,2.5,n,"Dreamscape: 5 out of 10: Not to be confused with Innerspace (The one with Martin Short) Dreamscape has Dennis Quaid as a psychic mind reading never do well kidnaped by a government agency to work in their dream program. A great cast and premise are let down by a poor script and story as well as some underwhelming action beats.

The Good: The cast here is great across the board. Max von Sydow and Christopher Plummer? Why you are just one, Christopher Lee, away from a trifecta of awesome. Dennis Quaid is at maximum smirk level, Kate Capshaw is surprisingly sexy and you even have George Wendt in a cameo of sorts. 

The premise of being able to enter peoples dreams and change their minds or fix their psychosis is a fun one that has been revisited over the years by better properties. (Or even the same year by Nightmare on Elm Street.)

The Bad: All movie universes have rules. The rules can change throughout the movie as a major plot point (See The Matrix) but overall good stories work within the rule set that they themselves set up. Dreamscape is all over the place.

It is established Dennis Quaidâ(TM)s character is psychic which allows him to enter other peoples dreams. Can he also see the future? The movie is unclear. Obviously reading peoples minds would not help him win money at the horse track. Yet the film sets him up as doing just that. (Poker player is a much more obvious choice.) They also have him being chased by track people for I assume winning too much which makes zero sense if you have any inkling about how betting at a large state-run horse track works.

On the other hand, if he can see into the future why would he make the idiotic choices that he does?  Câ(TM)mon to think of it if he can read minds why doesnâ(TM)t he realize who the bad guys are well before the audience. (In all fairness you donâ(TM)t hire David Patrick (Warriors, come out to play-i-ay.) Kelly to be a good guy. 

Can you die in a dream? The entire plot revolves around a planned assassination during a dream but the opening dream sequences clearly show that you are not killed in a dream. The movie seemingly changes its own rules halfway through. 

The Ugly: What is Christopher Plummerâ(TM)s endgame in this thing. Here has a tool to enter peoples minds and change the way they think  (Inception) and instead he is thinking all Freddy Kruger complete with claymation snake monster. Even if he succeeded one can clearly see it would not work out the way he wanted it to. 

In Conclusion: Great cast basically wasted on tepid sci-fi premise. Special effects are of the time so I can excuse them but the action sequences wouldnâ(TM)t be out of place in a lighthearted Quincy episode. The charisma of the leads isnâ(TM)t enough to carry the tepid romance and the excellent chops of the bad guys are helpless against their lame-brained scheme. Passable curiosity piece and time capsule but it never really rises above its own averageness. 



Dreamscape (Rifftrax edition): 4 out of 10: Janet Varney and Cole Stratton guest star as riffers and it does not work out well. Dreamscape provides plenty of material for a really good riff, unfortunately, our guest riffers leave most of it on the table. What they do bring to the table is some very low hanging fruit punctuated by lots of silence. There is also seemingly no real connection or banter between the two where one feels they recorded their riffs separately. Honestly, they add nothing to the movie and are at best a distraction."

I love the fact that I was paying close attention and super engaged in order to catch every detail of this vivid complex world and the fascinating storyline. The story follows the digitalization of aging actress Robin Wright, and how signing up for her final acting job has consequences that will affect her in ways no one would have considered. This animated sci-fi uses a bright and exciting colour palette that is equal parts captures both a trippy and thought-provoking film.

The films proposed conception of making movie stars into a unit makes the viewer realize how much this story relates to the reality many feel when they sign a contract into stardom. The film's blending of reality and animation also brings attention to the possible pitfalls of drug addiction and how one can lose touch with reality when they avoid facing their addiction. Robin Wright is amazing in this, bringing emotion to each scene as she goes from superstar to the face of a revolution that she hates. She shows how a person's love for their child can be the driving force in keeping their sanity, and the film is a reminder that the ones who love you are the people that will go the limit for you. It's an amazing film that highlights Hollywood's corruption, dependency, & the loss of humanity we face in this world, and I can't wait to watch it again."
148,the_congress,audience,3.5,p,"Why do people make films?

To entertain us is the most obvious answer. But some films are made to educate us. Some great films inspire us to envision and create a better world.

And then there are films made simply to rake in cash, films with no intelligence or humanity, like The Transformers franchise or almost anything starring Adam Sandler. And to support this bottom line of greed, a new reason for making films has emerged: to anesthetize us.

In The Congress, a performer named Robin Wright is played by Robin Wright. She's offered a very unusual contract by a ""Miramount"" studio executive (played with oily perfection by Danny Huston).

After giving Wright an obscene amount of money, Miramount will use advanced technology to scan her image with such precision that they she never needs to appear on a film set. Miramount owns her likeness as a performer, and can do anything with it — while she is not allowed to perform on film or even in public herself. Robin Wright the human being is no longer an actor, while Robin Wright the actor is now computer code owned by Miramount.

Twenty years later, she has aged most gracefully. But her computer likeness is ever youthful, appearing as a kick-ass Matrix-like superhero. It makes no matter that the flesh-and-blood Robin Wright is actually far more beautiful and interesting than her computer likeness. That is of no value to a film studio looking for the next profitable action franchise.

In this future, Wright is invited to a convention or ""congress"" at Miramount. But before entering the property, she is required to inhale a drug that causes her to see everything as a brightly-colored cartoon. (Imagine an LSD trip as illustrated by Max Fleischer.) This makes it hard to know exactly what's real, and that's the point. In this bright, shiny cartoon world, Hollywood has joined forces with the pharmaceutical industry to ensure the masses are less and less in touch with reality. They are obedient consumers.

As Wright says at the congress after storming the stage and grabbing the microphone away from a speaker: ""Wake up, people. Wake up.""

The Congress is based on the 1971 novel The Futurological Congress by Polish sci-fi writer Stanislaw Lem."

170,1198124-shutter_island,audience,5.0,p,Best twist in movie history
171,1198124-shutter_island,audience,5.0,p,"Shutter Island lingers in your mind like pain.

Director Martin Scorsese crafts a brilliant psychological horror mystery with his haunting picture Shutter Island (2010). Scorsese makes you believe in every clue and hides all the terrible truths through wonderful deceptions. Shutter Island has an eerie tone, especially with the assorted classical soundtrack that bursts into hearing with sudden melodies. I appreciate sound designers Eugene Gearty, Marissa Littlefield, Philip Stockton, and Tom Fleischman's creepy echoing noises. From dead silence, building up dread, into these distant screams and richoting noises.

Writers Dennis Lehane alongside Laeta Kalogridis come up with endless narrative red herrings and clues to Scorsese's magnificent mystery. I really love how Shutter Island's story is more about repressed emotions and romantic understanding than any mind blowing twist. I feel like Scorsese wants you to empathize with his hero, so that you can understand his pain and relate to his conflicted confusion. Shutter Island is an exercise in trusting others over your own senses, while also expressing profound grief, and earnest acceptance as an admirable and necessary trait.

Leonardo DiCaprio is truly phenomenal as United States Marshal Teddy Daniels. His every pessimistic sneer and intelligent jab show Teddy's sly wit and careful observation about Shutter Island and its curious patients and staff. I continue to be stunned by DiCaprio's emotionally honest performance that he just lets loose with devastation at Shutter Island's shocking reveals and painful memories. Michelle Williams is wondrous as DiCaprio's dead wife Dolores Chanal in flashbacks and visions with her raw intensity and gentle sweetness that conveys a very peculiar atmosphere to Shutter Island. Her final scene is so upsetting that it is burned into my mind forever.

Mark Ruffalo is excellent as the attentive and steadfast U.S. Marshal Chuck Aule alongside Leonardo DiCaprio. You feel like Ruffalo is right along for Scorsese's dark adventure into the mind and the past. Ruffalo ensures that you're always in on each new detail and hints at unlocking the door of truth to Scorsese's mystery. Sir Ben Kingsley is fantastically entertaining as the blunt Dr. John Cawley with his nonchalant remarks delivered with a deadpan like only Kingsley could muster. Emily Mortimer is very touching as Rachel Solando with her emotional clarity and genuinely empathetic performance. Max von Sydow's supporting role as Dr. Jeremiah Naehring is bold and philosophical as a neat foil for DiCaprio.

Jackie Earle Haley has an absorbing and scary cameo as George Noyce with his violent manner and viciously delivered dialogue. Patricia Clarkson's cameo as Rachel Solando is fascinating and still keeps me guessing. Ted Levine is sinister and delightful as Shutter Island's blood-lustful Warden. John Carroll Lynch is pleasant and straightforward as Shutter Island's Deputy Warden McPherson. Elias Koteas channels his inner Robert De Niro as the unsettling Laeddis. You never know which character actor will appear next as Scorsese's cast for Shutter Island is splendid all around.

Scorsese plants an idea in your head from the beginning only to lure to an island of emotional horrors. His direction is fascinating as he will use subtle storytelling by having editor Thelma Schoonmaker cut in a flashback to concentration camps or a foreboding lake house. Shutter Island is so enthralling to me that it's formidable 138 minute run-time only feels like an hour.

I love cinematographer Robert Richardson's wide shots of this ominous, brooding island. All of Richardson's close-up shots of Leonardo are quite effective at showing his increasing paranoia and harrowing psychological experience while on Shutter Island. Dante Ferretti's production design creates all these rundown mental facilities and an opulent office for the head doctor of Shutter Island. Every creaking door and wet path feels intentional to imply the island's fearsome potential for murder or anguish. Set decorator Francesca Lo Shiavo finds all these antiques for the office, while providing sterile, cold medical and prison furnishings for the main buildings. 

Art directors Robert Guerra, Christina Ann Wilson, Barbra Matis, Patricia Woodbridge, Hinju Kim, Max Biscoe, and Marion Kolsby drew really striking imagery for Shutter Island's thoughtful frames. From a wife crumbling into ashes to her getting absorbed in a car explosion, Shutter Island is full of visual delights and conceptual tragedies. Sandy Powell's costume designs look retro in aesthetic with pleasant yellow Summer dresses to neat orderly uniforms, but there's a sorrow to each outfit in how they all look too nice. It's like there's something wrong the entire time. Make-up artists Manlio Rocchetti and Sian Grigg meld sweat into water and nerves into facial expressions with brilliant use of gritty bruises and ethereal looks.

My favorite Scorsese shot ever may be Leonardo DiCaprio embracing Michelle Williams amongst the cinders of a flame long past being lit. I am amazed at the breathtaking CGI from visual effects artists Ron Ames, Matthew Gratzner, Ben Grossmann, Christina Graff, Paul Graff, Magdalena Wolf, David Sanger, Shannon Blake, Gans Robert Legato, and Jonathan Stone. I feel chills when the water suddenly appears on Michelle Williams or the fiery inferno bursts forth onto her figure. Shutter Island is a gorgeously shot film with impeccable nuance even in Scorsese's visual metaphors. Scorsese and Richardson's visuals are captivating and startling. 

In conclusion, Shutter Island gets me gripped and finally releases this cathartic emotional reveal that still shocks me more than a decade later. I highly recommend seeing Shutter Island at least once for a dark and enchanting mystery from the master Martin Scorsese himself."

Why do I give this 5 stars? If you have empathy…. And a belief that this is not it all ends in slow ride in a hearse.. This movie will move you if you have ever lost someone close. You will be pissed and crying at times thinking of the ones that have past. But.. If you ever meet again in Heaven with your loved ones this is the way I would want it to be. The Cinematography is spectacular! Go in open minded and in the end you will be smiling! Rest In Peace Robin Williams!"

22,what_dreams_may_come,audience,4.0,p,"An imaginative meditation on the afterlife that may get overly ambitious, What Dreams May Come is a tale of the distances love can travel to be complete, that is both lovingly and heart-rendingly led by Robin Williams."
23,what_dreams_may_come,audience,1.5,n,"Really annoying. The visuals are too much in my opinion. I cab see why some people liked it but jesus it's so high contrast it was headache inducing. Also, you can never really depict something like heaven in a way that can ever live up to people's imagination. I feel that the movie fell drastically short on this front. Some parts even made me bust up laughing like the dog pouncing on williams. I did not like this movie at all. I didnt like the visuals I didnt like the story progression, i didnt like the characters, nothing."
24,what_dreams_may_come,audience,5.0,p,This movie is so heartbreaking and yet so beautiful. Robin Williams always knew how to touch my heart with his films. I miss him. I think I've seen this movie over 6 times and I still ball my eyes out watching it..

26,what_dreams_may_come,audience,4.5,p,Very beautiful and tear jerking. The only little thing that throws me off a bit is the visible 10 year age difference between Annabella Sciorra and Robin Williams. What are you gonna do?

32,truman_show,critics,fresh,p,"Director Peter Weir's signature lyricism pervades, with masterful performances from Carrey and supporting actors Ed Harris, Laura Linney and Paul Giamatti."
33,truman_show,critics,fresh,p,The ahead-of-its-time film spoke volumes about everything from politics to the rampant rise of reality TV.
34,truman_show,critics,fresh,p,My favorite role of Jim Carrey's career
35,truman_show,critics,fresh,p,"Ahead of its time, The Truman Show remains one of the best scripts ever. Clever and sweet, Peter Weir's execution is near perfect. Oh, and Jim Carrey is fantastic. [Full review in Spanish]"
36,truman_show,critics,fresh,p,"The Truman Show is one of the most startlingly original American movies in years, enough to give one faith in the salutary and inspiring nearness of the new millennium."
37,truman_show,critics,fresh,p,"[A] masterfully executed cautionary tale... Yet there's something missing here: While Weir delivers both sharp wit and gentle poignancy, Truman's end catharsis needs greater emotional heft."
38,truman_show,critics,fresh,p,"As Truman, Jim Carrey turns his usually frenetic acting style down to a subtle level many would have thought beyond him."
39,truman_show,critics,fresh,p,"You can't take your eyes off Jim Carry. He's the most likable clown since Charlie Chaplin, and his sunny smile lightens the serious subject matter. He's the perfect subject to make Reality TV a reality."
40,truman_show,critics,fresh,p,One of the greatest American films of the 1990s.
41,truman_show,critics,fresh,p,"One of the smartest, most inventive movies in memory, it manages to be as endearing as it is provocative."
42,truman_show,critics,fresh,p,"The premise of Peter Weir's The Truman Show is both reasonable and ludicrous, its execution sublime."
43,truman_show,critics,fresh,p,Most movies are lucky to have one idea rattling around inside. The unusually resonant Truman positively vibrates with themes.
44,truman_show,critics,fresh,p,"A disturbing, spooky but eventually uplifting drama/satire/horror film starring Jim Carrey."
45,truman_show,critics,fresh,p,The Truman Show finds a near-miraculous balance of humor and feeling in the keen intelligence of the script by Andrew Niccol and the prodigal inventiveness of Dead Poets Society director Peter Weir at his very best.
46,truman_show,critics,fresh,p,"To be sure, the movie has plenty of laughs, but like sunlight on the deceptively calm surface of the sea, its light humor dances fitfully over dark and dangerous undercurrents."
47,truman_show,critics,fresh,p,"Peter Weir's film is so cleverly conceived and brilliantly executed that it almost seems like a fresh thought. And even if it doesn't, it nevertheless forms the basis of a very witty exercise."
48,truman_show,critics,fresh,p,"Director Peter Weir has created a strikingly subversive piece of information-age paranoia as visionary as anything Hollywood might manufacture this summer, or this decade."
49,truman_show,critics,fresh,p,"The Truman Show will probably be the most thought-provoking ""big"" movie to come out this summer, and that says a whole lot more about other movies than it does about this one. You should, however, see it for Carrey's newly unveiled charms."
50,truman_show,audience,4.5,p,"I watched this as a kid and remember it as being far more profound then as I did watching it as an adult. I'm sure I spent weeks looking for signs that I was in a reality TV show and my viewing experience holds a permanent spot in my memory. My wife had never seen it before but had seen Pleasantville, so we traded experiences of sharing a similar childhood movie with each other, that was nice. I think Carrey is at his best when he doesn't try to fool you into thinking he's not a funny dude. He does some real, pure dramatic roles after this one that are just nowhere near as good; it's like he wanted to prove that he can still act with his hands tied behind his back, and he's right, but it's still not as entertaining as watching him in peak form like this. The most surprising part of my rewatch was how noticeably excellent Linney was in her role as hers was clearly the most difficult performance in the movie and she handled it with aplomb."

59,truman_show,audience,5.0,p,A true masterpiece of the cinema
60,total_recall,critics,fresh,p,"Total Recall as a film and Verhoeven as a filmmaker both have serious thematic concerns, beyond the simple, iconoclastic joy of throwing as much blood and boobs at the screen as they could get away with."
61,total_recall,critics,fresh,p,"...much more than just an Arnie vehicle, it's got the logic of a bad dream, and that makes for one of the great sci-fi action movies..."
62,total_recall,critics,fresh,p,Forget about the disposable Colin Farrell remake from 2012.
63,total_recall,critics,fresh,p,"From the outstandingly inventive prosthetics to the nonstop, volatile hullabaloo piled high with death and laugh-out-loud humor, the film is essential science-fiction viewing."
64,total_recall,critics,fresh,p,"Though the movie might make you think twice before embarking on a virtual staycation, Total Recall is ideal ""escapism"" - a big action movie with something to say."
65,total_recall,critics,fresh,p,The film's visual invention is offset by its visceral nastiness. Schwarzenegger's self-deprecatory good humour prevails none the less.
66,total_recall,critics,rotten,n,"Suffice it that machines crackle, futureworlds whirl and beings human and animal metamorphose before our eyes. Sci-fl addicts, see and enjoy. Everyone else may await, though not over-eagerly, the video."
67,total_recall,critics,fresh,p,"You get the action, the cheese, and some good sci-fi and practical effects. What's not to love?"
68,total_recall,critics,fresh,p,"Schwarzenegger is never going to make the De Niros and Hoffmans of this world lose a night's sleep, but he has acquired a new confidence as an actor under Verhoeven's guidance."
69,total_recall,critics,fresh,p,"Total Recall is slick, sly and subversive, and if some of the special effects have aged somewhat, that only adds to the charm."
70,total_recall,critics,fresh,p,"All told, Total Recall is a powerful brew of mordant humor, keen wit, refreshing originality and graphic violence."
71,total_recall,critics,fresh,p,"As Quaid, Schwarzenegger continues to stretch beyond his reach as an actor, relying on physical prowess to keep him in character."
72,total_recall,critics,rotten,n,"Total Recall went through four directors before Verhoeven finally took it on, and four writers worked on the script. It's no wonder the finished film emerges without a unifying style, or a single performance worth mentioning."
73,total_recall,critics,fresh,p,"If the movie sometimes seems overwhelmed by its budget and its legendary third-act problems, it's still entertainingly raw and brutal, full of whiplash pace and juicy exaggeration."
74,total_recall,critics,fresh,p,"If Total Recall isn't as much fun as I'd hoped, it's not as dreary as I'd feared. I wouldn't call it totally awesome, but it's far from being a total loss."
75,total_recall,critics,fresh,p,"The movie is a cartoon, though a mammothly enjoyable one."
76,total_recall,critics,fresh,p,"This rip-roaring slice of sci-fi excess remains Arnold Schwarzenegger's most satisfying film since his breakthrough hit, The Terminator."
77,total_recall,critics,rotten,n,Arnold Schwarzenegger brings an effective blend of machismo and innocence to his role. Too bad director Paul Verhoeven lets brainless violence and tricky special effects swamp the cleverness of the tale itself.
78,total_recall,critics,rotten,n,"Total Recall begins to self-destruct not long after Schwarzenegger arrives on Mars, and the story degenerates into a violent, stunningly foul-mouthed enterprise."
79,total_recall,critics,fresh,p,"If you don't ask too many questions, or just accept that it's all a dream so logic and science don't matter, then this is an enjoyable romp."
80,total_recall,audience,3.5,p,"The movie is good, energetic, violent, and well-written. But it still is an average early 90s sci-fi action film"
81,total_recall,audience,4.0,p,"Muy buena película, un verdadero clásico del genero de ciencia ficción. La trama es muy buena y original, con una historia entretenida y con muchos giros a todo momento que te enganchan mas y para que al final quedes sorprendido. Los efectos especiales de la película, a pesar de haberse hecho hace poco mas de 30 años, me parecen muy buenos. La acción de la película es genial, muy bien hecha e implementada. Por otro lado, todos los escenarios que crearon para las escenas son geniales y están muy bien hechos. Las actuaciones están bien y además siempre es muy bueno ver a Arnold Schwarzenegger en un papel. Por otro lado, toda la parte final de la película se me hizo larga y tediosa, aunque después el final me gusto. En conclusión, yo creo que es una película muy buena, que es una vista obligada para los fanáticos de la ciencia ficción."
82,total_recall,audience,2.0,n,"Normally I don't mind cheesy stuff, but this movie takes it to a whole new level. I didn't mind some of the action scenes which were pretty cool and decent plus some good one-liners, but the plot and certain events that took place were so ridiculous that I couldn't help but want the movie to end. It was also too unnecessarily sexualized and some of the special effects don't hold up unlike other movies that came out around that time."
83,total_recall,audience,4.0,p,"Great concept (based on the short story) The ending got ridiculous. Seems to influence other movies like The Matrix, Truman Show and Inception."
84,total_recall,audience,5.0,p,"Arnold movies in our household were not defined by its 'rating' but rather by the creativity of the deaths and the quality of the one-liners that followed. My dad would randomly blurt out 'Arnie' one liners while wandering around the house. 'What happened to Buzzsaw??' ...'He had to split.' 'Let off some steam, Bennett.' It was a glorious childhood. BUT Total Recall BLEW MY F*KING MIND. I still think to this day it would be one of the movies I would want with me if I ever found myself stranded on a desert island. I had previously watched Verhoeven's Robocop, ANOTHER movie that my parents got into an argument over whether or not I should be able to watch it. Somehow common sense gave way and my dad won the argument with the it's SO violent that it would come across not disturbing... but comical. Thanks dad. The melting henchman splattered by a ford taurus still haunts me to this day. BUT I remember watching Total Recall and it was like a new kind of movie I had never seen before. Science fiction, action, mystery, comedy... It rendered my 10 year old brain into useless grey mush. It had Arnie splatting and crunching guys left and right but ON MARS. The makeup and effects... are still amazing. Even with the '2 weeks' woman's disguise sectioning off and revealing an obviously practical Arnie head (which there's gotta be a good amount used in this movie) with a giant metal bracket behind for what reason?? Who cares... I still LOVE. And Kuato... or 'SEE YOU AT THE PARTY RICHTER!' Not to mention one of the best villain deaths of all time. God, I just love this movie. I'm actually gonna wrap this up and go watch it... see ya."
85,total_recall,audience,4.5,p,"Paul Verhoeven directed one of my all-time favorites in Starship Troopers and created a sci-fi psychological thriller seven-years earlier with Total Recall. There's enough indulgent violence and sex for the teenagers (a woman in a futuristic Mars bordello flashes her thrice-breasted chest), and enough existential questions for the adults. That's not to say there aren't visual delights for the rest of us, for Total Recall has a secret weapon — Rob-f****n'-Bottin (The Thing), the master of practical effects. If you're a long-time reader of my blog, you'll know I gush for practical effects, and Bottin gets to flex his muscles with the eye-popping, head-deformed, mini-humanoid-bulging-out-of-his-brother's-body moments. As an adaptation of a Philip K. Dick short-story (We Can Remember It For You Wholesale), the movie includes many of the signature futuristic, sci-fi elements that have become staples of the genre: self-driving cars/cabs, omnipresent screens, body scanners for weapons/contraband, holograms, space colonies, etc. But what is centrally featured in Total Recall is the timeless concept of memories and dreams. Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is just your average construction worker (bet your ass we get a shot of his sleeveless arms working a jackhammer) with dreams of travel… or he's a secret agent… or he's the memory of a secret-agent inside the mind of an average construction worker? Quaid travels to Mars (or he doesn't) to answer the question of who he really is, or he pays the Rekall company to have these action-packed, sex-filled memories implanted in his brain — the 2089 equivalent of a ""staycation"". *Side Note* I love how Arnie's accent, in any movie, is never questioned, sort of an unwritten rule. Sure, the film has typical stupid action movie moments — when he arrives at Mars comes to mind — but I suppose it's part of that Verhoeven schlock. The ""red light"" district on Mars is one of the coolest sets I've seen and the film has a bunch of the same actors we later see in Starship Troopers: Michael Ironside, Marshall Bell, and Dean Norris. Pretty standard message of ""whoever controls the resources (here, air) controls society"". Total Recall is a must-watch for sci-fi fans. So long as you don't mind a badass dwarf (Debbie Lee Carrington) shooting a machine-gun, three-breasted prostitutes, eyes being sucked out of heads and other gratuitous violence, you will also enjoy this film."
86,total_recall,audience,4.5,p,"This movie was really fun to watch. Though at times cheesy, Total recall is a film that keeps you engaged and interested to know what's coming next."
87,total_recall,audience,3.5,p,"As you know, I've banged on about my love for Paul Verhoeven repeatedly, but I realised at the weekend I was a fraudulent fan; I'd never seen Total Recall. How I'd managed this is beyond me, but I have now thankfully have rectified this shortcoming, and, of course, Total Recall is brilliant. Verhoeven's eye for depicting futuristic dystopias is masterful, most notably in Robocop (1987). Totall Recall is loosely based on a Philip K Dick short, much like Blade Runner several years earlier, and although Total Recall is no match for that in terms of masterpieces of sci-fi, it doesn't aim to be. There's some wonderful world building both in the scenes on Earth and on Mars, as a fantastic Arnold Schwarzenegger runs riot trying to work out whether is mind has been stolen from him, whether it's all a dream, or indeed whether he actually exists or not. It really is a blast, but Verhoeven's attention to detail (especially in a seedy bar area of the Mars colony) puts you front and centre of the mayhem, and goes to pains to ensure the effects are impressive, and they even hold up well today. It's a shame I have to once again point out not to bother with the 2012 remake, but even more shameful on my part is that I saw the 2012 version first. My only defence is that I have at least now, tried to right my wrongs as best I can in that respect."

92,primer,critics,fresh,p,"Certainly there are many flaws with this project, most from a technical standpoint and obviously due to the budget, but despite those shortcomings, Primer still stands out as the most intellectually stimulating film of the year."

116,primer,audience,3.5,p,"""Cinema is a time machine,"" suggested Sontag, and from that theoretical vantage, Carruth's intricate indie becomes just a bit more intelligible, for in a sense he really has made something that allows viewers to travel in time, a complex object that demands to be revisited and rewatched and relived to be understood. Just like the characters on screen, the audience must enter into the black box of the film, experience the timeline it presents in full, then return again to the beginning—as only recorded art allows—to make use of our newfound knowledge. Beyond mere metaphor, the movie is an allegory of its own creation, cobbled together from spare parts on a budget and bordering upon impenetrable, its recursive structure needing to be stopped and apprehended only from within itself."

142,being_john_malkovich,audience,5.0,p,"I am deeply impressed by that wonderful, thought-provoking film. Maybe one of my favorite of all time, seriously. Odd, dark and yet so funny, this movie got me on so many levels. It made me anxious, but so entertained. After all, it was a big drama about a men that wants to change is life because he is not good in his after finding a way to be John Malkovich but it turns out his wife and colleague/mistress also want that so because he doesn't care about his life he sees it being stolen. He lost his life to be someone else. That is the philosophy of Being John Malkovich. Being someone else isn't necessarily good. Be yourself just like her wife who just fell in love with an other woman.

The movie may be dramatic and full of questions but it is also funny and entertaining. That is why I said it caught me on a lot of levels. It's not only that I found the message good. I also liked the cinematography, the acting and the fact that this movie is completely weird. It is off the tracks but it is so good! It covers almost every genres of movie: Comedy, drama, fantasy (yes it has a bit of fantasy), romance, etc. I think I will never see John Malkovich the same way after seeing this.

The film actually tackles issues that are extremely pertinent today; for example after going into the mind of Malkovich Craig's wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz in a career best role) claims she's never felt so right in the body of a man, and is considering becoming a transexual. These topics are beautifully written alongside some truly hilarious scripting, and Kauffman's insane screenplay is directed with panache by Spike Jonze. As well as Diaz, Cusack is fantastically weird as Craig, and John Malkovich pulls off what is without doubt the best display of someone playing both themselves (and several other people) I've ever seen. It's truly a masterpiece."
144,being_john_malkovich,audience,4.5,p,"Es una película tan buena como extraña e interesante a la vez por su trama tan original y bizarra. John Malkovich tiene una gran actuación mientras alguien más finge ser él; también John Cuscak, Catherine Keener y Cameron Diaz tienen actuaciones destacables. La recomiendo muchísimo ya que te mantiene entretenido con una historia muy original y con actores muy buenos."
145,being_john_malkovich,audience,5.0,p,"This is among my top 10 films, along with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It's weird and thought-provoking in all the best ways."
146,being_john_malkovich,audience,5.0,p,"I wish I could go back in time and scrape the blue-green filter Spike Jonze used on this masterpiece (I hate that Instagram filter!), but, this movie gave me all sorts of wild dreams after I saw it, and I would shoot up in the middle of the night with ""Malkovich Malkovich!"" on the tip of my tongue.

There is lots of God/Goddess dramedy going on in this for me; the depressed puppeteer longing for his work to be taken seriously while simultaneously desiring a spiritual lover, and putting on inappropriate puppet shows (not for kids, but kids show up) on the street to demonstrate his longing.

Of course the puppeteer's wife takes care of all the animals, and is the very desirable Cameron Diaz in a bad wig, but, on with the show...

This film would take many moons to dissect, and it's one the viewer really needs to break apart and put back together themselves."
147,being_john_malkovich,audience,2.0,n,Not as good as it thinks it is. Starts out somewhat strong but then decides to become weird beyond comprehension and relies on interpretation
148,being_john_malkovich,audience,5.0,p,"Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman are just a good duo. Back when original movies were still being made — that magical cinematic year of 1999 — Kaufman wrote this jaw-droppingly interesting script that gives us the gem, Being John Malkovich. I first viewed it years ago, and remembered the main premise, but had completely forgotten about the love-triangle (quadrangle?) between the characters. Upon a 2020 viewing, it felt prescient in the commentary on the omnipresence of live-streaming and reality-TV — they even make a note of the experience being 15 minutes inside of Malkovich (John Malkovich), your 15 minutes of fame. But focusing only on this feels superficial, as Kaufman's work centers on deeper concepts, always, herein being consciousness, self-control, destiny, and reincarnation. What I love about BJM is that there's really no one to root for. Craig (John Cusack), Lotte (Cameron Diaz), and Maxine (Catherine Keener) are all pretty shitty in their own ways — Lotte being the least shitty, but not the most sympathetic either. There's a lot here to discuss for a pocket review, so I'll only address the reincarnation concept, which I actually think could've been expanded on more and introduced earlier. It's an area I've been super interested in recently, but here it felt sloppy; all of the sudden, a bunch of elderly individuals are going to live inside Malko's head… together? Will they control him, like Craig does? I also didn't completely understand how Craig stayed inside for months/years. I loved how the puppeteering became a larger part of the plot and not just a way to show Craig is unique. There's also commentary here on the privilege of the celebrity-class. As Craig is inside of Malko, his skills as a puppeteer have remained the same, but because he's now a well-known celebrity, he ""reinvents"" himself as a master puppeteer and given credit for reviving the art form — when Craig (inside Malko) tells his agent he wants to quit acting for puppeteering, his agent responds, ""Okay. Great. Fine. Poof! You're a puppeteer."" (para.) Cannot help but compare it to the recent Chrissy Teigen-Alison Roman spat. Other notes: The ""Many Malkovichs"" scene is unforgettable, Keener was really good in her diabolical role, and John Cusack makes the same facial expressions as his sister, Joan. It's such an interesting and original film, I'd think any sort of cinephile has viewed it already, but Being John Malkovich is a must-see for pretty much anyone."
149,being_john_malkovich,audience,4.5,p,This movie is so fantastically weird and interesting and John Malkovich delivers such a great performance while someone else is pretending to be him and all the same time it shows an emotional performance from John Cuscak and Catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz this movie will make you be happy for originality

151,possessor_uncut,critics,fresh,p,"If an artistically crafted, sci-fi thriller dealing with technology, humanity with body horror elements is your favorite, you may love this film."
152,possessor_uncut,critics,fresh,p,"Possessor is a tough, grim, smart, hellishly good-looking film, completely committed to its own engines and determined never to let us off the hooks of voyeurism and complicity."
153,possessor_uncut,critics,fresh,p,Cronenberg's germ of a thesis in Possessor about the precarious boundaries between our various identities is still one that I find compelling despite the film's shortcomings in fully exploring them.
154,possessor_uncut,critics,fresh,p,"There is a such a delicate balance undertaken here: Possessor is in turns shocking and tragic, suspenseful and inevitable, repellent and enticing"
155,possessor_uncut,critics,rotten,n,"About half way through the film, ""Possessor: Uncut starts to become a blurry mess."
156,possessor_uncut,critics,fresh,p,A much more mature intellectual exercise than [Brandon Cronenberg's] debut feature Antiviral. [Full review in Spanish]
157,possessor_uncut,critics,fresh,p,"It's a tour-de-force of New Weird genre work, a blast of old-school body horror, and a strangely empathetic portrait of slipping sanity."
158,possessor_uncut,critics,fresh,p,"Both at the top of their game, it's Riseborough's performance that really lingers - and her honest, human emotion that grounds the film in enough sanity..."
159,possessor_uncut,critics,fresh,p,Flesh and identity. Blood and pain. What a delight.
160,possessor_uncut,critics,fresh,p,"While Possessor is a must-watch for fans of horror and dark science fiction, it never quite takes possession of us."
161,possessor_uncut,critics,fresh,p,"Once again proving himself to be as provocative and imaginatively horrific as his father, Cronenberg equally disturbs and delights viewers with Possessor, the weirdest and most unique horror film in recent memory."
162,possessor_uncut,critics,fresh,p,"There is a chilly contemporary sheen to this that is all the film-maker's own, a mood bolstered by powerful performances from Riseborough."
163,possessor_uncut,critics,fresh,p,"Dystopian sci-fi thriller Possessor features some brief but intense scenes of highly textured violence; you can really feel the teeth shatter, the bones crack and the skulls crunch as they give way."
164,possessor_uncut,critics,fresh,p,"Believe the hype: Possessor is as good, if not better, than you've heard"
165,possessor_uncut,critics,fresh,p,"Delivering some of the most inventive sequences of the year (sorry, Tenet), Possessor is a visceral, soul-shattering experience unlike anything you've ever seen before"
166,possessor_uncut,critics,fresh,p,"Though Cronenberg does an expert job of creating the berserk visual scenes, the acting is an incredible standout."
167,possessor_uncut,critics,fresh,p,"The destabilizing Francis Baconesque montages and detonations of extreme gore in Brandon Cronenberg's brainy, bloody thriller may be as psychically disruptive for the viewer as for Andrea Riseborough's contract killer"
168,possessor_uncut,critics,fresh,p,"The psychological terror evoked masterfully by Cronenberg, the cast, and the crew is unmatched...Style, craft, technical prowess and sheer defiant will to create are on display here."
169,possessor_uncut,critics,rotten,n,"Possessor Uncut has its moments, but there's still a disconnect between body and mind."
170,possessor_uncut,audience,4.0,p,"""Possessor"" is undeniably original and shocking. The first act is amazing with an even better hook, with mysterious performances by Andrea Riseborough and Jennifer Jason Leigh (who is going deeper in good independent films after ""The Hateful Eight""). The second act (the beginning of the main mission) is dragged. The pace stalls, I felt tired and what held me is the curiosity about what was going to happen. Fortunately, I was rewarded with a surprising and disconcerting third act that almost made me cry. Brandon Cronenberg knows how to use violence to disturb the spectator. He directed another movie in 2012, Antiviral. I'll see it today, he is a director with great potential for extreme psychological horror."
171,possessor_uncut,audience,2.5,n,"Whether or not Possessor was intent on being a confusing and alienating viewing experience, it succeeded in being just that. The film starts well enough with a heightened sense of intrigue with its Black Mirror-esk Sci-fi framework, but shortly devolves into a muddled arraignment of sequences that vacillate between tedious filler and scenes that could be described as a ""bad trip."" 

Anchored in almost all these scenes is our lead character, Tasya, whom is an unfeeling sociopath we are stuck with as she beings losing her sense of self while far more likeable supporting characters are excessively butchered throughout.  

While it's a visually appealing film that may very well have some deeper themes newcomer director Brandon Cronenberg wants you to explore --which pretentious film school students can spend years dissecting-- there's no denying that the film is just unpleasant."
172,possessor_uncut,audience,0.5,n,"Tired of this sort o0f non-nonsensical, waste of time. Half a star is probably too  much."
173,possessor_uncut,audience,2.5,n,"Decent movie to pass the time, could easily have 20 minutes shaved off.

You can really feel how hard it wants to be an art film with shock value, but then again, what do you expect from a Cronenberg?

It would've worked better as a straight up action/thriller. But the message of ""identity... what is it"" and the CONSTANT post-modern imagery just muddles the entire movie.

But again... what do you expect from a Cronenberg? Haha"
174,possessor_uncut,audience,5.0,p,"Very smart film.  Leaves you with a lot to think about.  Like, are we a similuation?  Scifi mixed with psychological horror.  The main character Tas Vos posses other peoples bodies and turns them into assassins.  But due to the complexeties of the ""neural lace"" the assin programing gets janky and this is where the story begins.  Elon Musk talks about neural lace, truth is stranger than fiction.  Could this be how some murderers are made in real life?"
175,possessor_uncut,audience,5.0,p,Great debut from Brandon.
176,possessor_uncut,audience,5.0,p,Like Kubrick...only better.
177,possessor_uncut,audience,5.0,p,"Ficção científica de qualidade e terror pesado pra caramba, o Cronen filho não tenta emular o estilo do pai, mas constrói uma atmosfera de terror forte, uma ficção científica que não  perde tempo explicando muita coisa, ótimo filme, digno do pai."
178,possessor_uncut,audience,3.5,p,It's a good film but a brilliant concept. It felt pretty flat when trying to visualise the mental state of the main character. However the overall story time and the final product make it a pretty good watch.
179,possessor_uncut,audience,5.0,p,"Brandon is definitely his fathers son! Tasya is one crazy b**** as portrayed through Christopher Abbott's amazing performance. This film is brutal, bloody and totally dark and original. Can't wait to see what's next from him. I guess hijacking people's body and mind for murder isn't such a good idea."
180,wander_darkly,critics,rotten,n,"As the film spins its wheels on the question of what is real and isn't, that gimmicky mystery overwhelms whatever interest Miller generates in her character's plight."
181,wander_darkly,critics,fresh,p,Wander Darkly is thoroughly Just Fine.
182,wander_darkly,critics,rotten,n,Sienna Miller is a formidable centrepiece in the drama about a couple forced to review their relationship history after a car crash. But she is held down by a story that feels like it was clipped together in a rush.
183,wander_darkly,critics,fresh,p,"Watching a couple bicker is never much fun but, while the good times are rolling, the film's high concept and abundance of passion are impressive."
184,wander_darkly,critics,rotten,n,Wander Darkly is a superficial relationship drama lazily gussied up in the form of a clunky metaphysical thriller.
185,wander_darkly,critics,fresh,p,Not to worry. The phoney-baloney sunbeams can't mar the dark magic of what's gone before.
186,wander_darkly,critics,fresh,p,"The film's account of how memories shift and evolve has a fizzy confidence, so Miele could surely have afforded to make it weirder, instead of tidying it up with a pat ending."
187,wander_darkly,critics,fresh,p,"The fluidity of Tamara Meem and Alex O'Flinn's editing here is astonishing, and heavily reminiscent of 2004's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind - though director Tara Miele never pushes for the same level of absurdity."
188,wander_darkly,critics,rotten,n,Wander Darkly is ambitious and striking yet infuriatingly tricksy.
189,wander_darkly,critics,fresh,p,"...somewhere between Ghost and Jacob's Ladder, but more blurred, adult and agonising than either..."
190,wander_darkly,critics,fresh,p,"Miller is at the heart of the film; her natural and believable performance touches so many emotions, and makes them all look so real."
191,wander_darkly,critics,fresh,p,"Nevertheless, Miller does a lot with what she has and ensures the film never tips its hand about what's really going on until Miele is ready to do so."
192,wander_darkly,critics,rotten,n,An ambitious failure.
193,wander_darkly,critics,fresh,p,"A beautifully made, visually stunning exploration of life's broadest questions. Though it dazzles, there is a shallowness and unanchored nature to the film, one which dilutes its potential."
194,wander_darkly,critics,fresh,p,"While mostly a downer of a film, Wander Darkly gets points for not trying to gloss over the faults of its characters, delivering a story that earns its emotions thanks to its authenticity."
195,wander_darkly,critics,fresh,p,"Wander Darkly is a surreal romance, a painful, yet beautiful expression of what it means to be in love, and what two people will do to achieve that connection."
196,wander_darkly,critics,fresh,p,"Here is a movie that feels specifically tied to a woman's ruminations on grief and guilt. It moves past revelation to resolution, and becomes rather touching along the way."
197,wander_darkly,critics,fresh,p,"The plot keeps folding in on itself. The answers might not be as sharp and smart as you'd like, but the disjointed trip there is worth the price of admission."
198,wander_darkly,critics,fresh,p,"An elegant, emotionally moving feature that provides a new perspective on the complexity of relationships."
199,wander_darkly,critics,fresh,p,"Wander Darkly is a heavy, somber film that felt experimental at times, but the two leads made it watchable. Despite the film's flaws, I commend Tara Miele for taking such a harrowing personal experience into an art form."
200,wander_darkly,audience,3.5,p,"Wander Darkly is a truly fascinating film. A film that is both soulful and experimental. It's an ambitious film that manages to pull it off mostly. Adrienne and Matteo are a couple experiencing strife within themselves despite having a child and a home together. While driving away from a party, their arguing causes an accident that leaves them hospitalized. At this point the film goes on a trip that involves their past and their separate and combined memories. We never quite know where the truth lies but it never gets actually confusing, a testimony to the direction and the great editing to make it all work. It's a visceral film where emotions run high and the memories play tricks. Thanks to great performances from Diego Luna and Sienna Miller the emotions are real and centered. A very clever film where execution matches ambition."
201,wander_darkly,audience,3.0,p,"Writer-director Tara Miele's leap from TV to feature debut is essentially a love story with a touch of the supernatural. When the film begins, it's obvious something is not right in the relationship between new parents Adrienne and Matteo, played by Sienna Miller and Diego Luna. One accident later, the film begins retelling their love story via a fluidly executed narrative mechanism that flits between two possible states of mind: is she dead or is she just concussed and confused? To an extent, it's your typical examination of two people falling in love and eventually deciding to live together and have a child, where everything in between is then reassessed with a certain amount of hindsight. The film has something intriguing, if not insightful even, to say as it charts how the couple is challenged as the passion slowly burns away and external forces and pressure intervene. Despite a few clunky dialogue (if you have a shot every time Matteo asks Adrienne do you remember something, you'd be drunk half-way into the film), Miele maintains an effective and mysterious surreality as the film transitions through scenes, time and events, keeping it all dreamily atmospheric while constantly propelling the narrative forward on different levels at the same time. Miller is a solid lead who anchors well and her Adrienne is sympathetic and understandable. In films like this, the best resolution is one that's hidden in plain sight, something that makes sense yet might not have crossed the audience's mind. Even though my suspicion as to where the film was heading is proved correct, I was satisfied with the ending because I didn't feel cheated by it, even if it turns out to be a different and sadder film than I first anticipated."
202,wander_darkly,audience,4.0,p,"Heartfelt drama with an ambitious dreamlike style.

Writer and director Tara Miele's surreal romance drama Wander Darkly (2020) is quite moving if you have patience and empathy enough to lose yourself to its dreamy surrealism. Tara Miele is a director to look out for as her creative vision with her endearing script and flowing direction is captivating to Wander Darkly's entire quick 97 minutes. Miele's direction feels similar to Tree of Life, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, i'm thinking of ending things, Inception, Interstellar, and Shutter Island. It's a curious way to shoot a romance drama story while weaving in and out of memories, but Wander Darkly really works. You're absorbed by each scene without ever quite predicting the endless twists. Tara Miele's writing comes across as realistic marriage drama dialogue, existentialism, with hopeful conversations and conclusions. Wander Darkly is satisfying and a curious picture like few others.

Sienna Miller absolutely steals the entire film as the adorable and endearing Adrienne. She's devastating as I really felt for each emotional disturbance or sweet memory with her. Her subtle facial expressions display a genuine understanding for her character's unique suffering. Sienna Miller is phenomenal in Wander Darkly with her nuanced performance. I like her as an actress ever since I was stunned by her beauty, wit, and charisma in Casanova with Heath Ledger. But Miller is particularly touching in Wander Darkly with a grounded sense of pain and love within her intimate acting. Diego Luna is fantastic as Matteo in one of his best dramatic roles in Wander Darkly. He plays the concerned husband, estranged spouse, and loving boyfriend. He feels gentle and sincere, while also hiding something.

Vanessa Bayer is cute and likable as Adrienne's close and supportive friend Maggie. Aimee Carrero is gorgeous and playful as Matteo's flirty other woman Shea. I wish Bayer and Carrero were in Wander Darkly much more to flesh out their characters a bit. Beth Grant's stern and obstinate mother Patty is excellent. You hate and sympathize with her immediately. Brett Rice is good as Adrienne's father Steve, who just doesn't seem to know how to handle his daughter's emotions. Tory Kittles is pretty good as Adrienne's potential other man Liam with his charming personality.

Editors Tamara Meem and Alex O'Flinn cut seamlessly in between dream sequences with fluid pacing and natural motion. Their sleek editing pairs nicely with Carolina Costa's cinematography. Costa's shots are gorgeous in breathtaking wide shots and visually creative close-ups. Her perspective choices are varied and inventive with a pleasant moving camera that flows around the central characters with a warm empathy. Katie Byron's production design allows for esoteric cold hospital hallways and genuinely cozy homes alike. Christopher Lawrence's costumes are pretty modern with an authentic contemporary appeal. Sienna Miller looks stunning in every dress and outfit combination from Lawrence.

Alex Weston's score is so light and romantic with a mesmerizing fantasy feel I really loved. Wander Darkly already looks incredible with vivid colors and bright lights flaring into faces, but alongside Weston's ethereal music, I was swept away to those lovely Mexican sea waters."
203,wander_darkly,audience,3.0,p,"Really interesting concept in this metaphysical Romantic drama, but it's all just a little too vague and aimless to fully satisfy. Though I will say, it's the type of film that will have you talking after, trying to unravel the meaning of it all. That and Sienna Miller is excellent in it. Something I never thought I'd say about Sienna Miller..."
204,wander_darkly,audience,2.5,n,"Consistently intriguing, but just as frequently frustrating given the premise of the film pits a woman (Sienna Miller finally making me realize the value of ""Starring Sienna Miller"") dealing in the trauma, uncertainty, and fragility of life as she moves through her memories while wading between life and death that is all undermined by the fact she spends it dealing with someone she clearly should have never been with in the first place. Diego Luna's Matteo epitomizes ""bad boyfriend"" vibes or just wasn't the right fit for Miller's Adrienne, I don't know, but either way - the lack of connection or care either of them have for the life they were building together can't help but to translate to the viewer as well. While sporting some cool ideas, some innovative editing, and Miller giving it her all Wander Darkly is ultimately unable to make-up for the lack of engagement (and I mean that in more ways than one) we feel with these people even if we want to sympathize with their circumstances."
205,wander_darkly,audience,3.5,p,3.5 out of 5 stars. Wander Darkly is a pretty fair film about a couple Adrienne (Sienna Miller) and Matteo (Diego Luna) who are struggling with there relationship. When an accident leaves them in a trauma. Where they face the past and current conflict with there relationship. They try to resolve there conflict that is holding them back. The plot i can not say much more without going into spoiler territory. It was surprisingly good. A car accident affecting them both. Such as facing life after death. Dealing with loss and grief. And how a humans mind work itself in dealing with trauma. Adrienne and Matteo are dealing with a troubled relationship. Where they test each others love for one and another. It is an emotional movie. And has a twist that will keep you guessing til the end. Diego Luna and Sienna Miller did a great job with there roles. I did find the exposition being too dragged on. And slow in the end. But it is a wonderful film.

23,nine_days,audience,5.0,p,"Nothing like some light existentialism before breakfast.

The fact that each of us is even here is mind cripplingly remarkable when considering the odds in the evolutionary lottery which, when taken into consideration, should make the pain involved with living feel like less of a burden.

I don't think I have seen a film more up my alley so far this year. The dazzlingly creative concept, well honed performances and beautifully moving score were all perfectly suited and really created some heavy feelings, thoughts, and emotions throughout. There were times I felt intense joy, and others equally intense sadness, while also going off into my own reveries of reflection.

While never feeling derivative in the slightest this film definitely had a Damon Lindelof feel to me, which I say as a huge compliment to Oda as Lindelof is a favorite storyteller of mine. Aside from nailing the ending and credits scoring, I prob give Oda the MVP here for that bicycle ride. I will definitely be looking for Edson Oda again, and if any future work is half as creative and stimulating as this, I will surely be all in."
24,nine_days,audience,3.0,p,"Nine Days is a disappointing indie drama that had such a terrific premise full of potential that was solidly realized in its somewhat interesting first half, but the second half was very dull in its slow pace and quite repetitive in structure. The dialogue is fine as are a couple of its acting performances, but the directing and writing needed to have been better."

34,luxor,critics,fresh,p,"A truly beautiful film, with stunning shots of the city and desert, and a journey of one woman's past trauma to future happiness."
35,luxor,critics,rotten,n,"Full of gorgeous scenery, but only desultory drama, the pokey picture often feels as aimless as its heroine, and seems unlikely to find many fans beyond armchair travelers looking for an Egyptian jaunt."

42,luxor,critics,fresh,p,"Nabbing Andrea Riseborough for her sympathetic lead, it's a subtle rumination on the depleting forces of trauma, pondered glibly through a brief respite in a city wherein the troubled intrigue of ghosts from an ancient culture are forever nigh."
43,luxor,critics,fresh,p,"Sometimes a little meandering, this lovely (visually and otherwise) tale works as a moment of meditative stillness, a passing shelter against global chaos-chaos that can be ignored or denied for a time, yet which never goes away."
44,luxor,critics,fresh,p,London-born Arab writer-director Zeina Durra's Luxor is sort of a meditative throwback to the '60s era of art-house cinema when movies were allowed to not always fill in the plot blanks for audiences.
45,luxor,critics,rotten,n,"This is one of those movies that gives the notion of an ""arthouse"" film a bad name."
46,luxor,critics,fresh,p,"Luxor is a character in its own right, and for a film without much conflict or action, it feels like you're watching a virtual tour - a perfect escape during these quarantine times - but it's also an intimate, spiritual story of second chances."

51,luxor,audience,5.0,p,"Excellent film. An intriguing story about a doctor, Hana, and a former lover that she runs into in Luxor, Egypt.  She's on furlough from practicing medicine in a war zone. Hana is physically and emotionally exhausted from the horrific work and things she saw. As she visits one of the ruins, the tour guide asked the question, "" How do we conquer our own inner demons?

There's little of value here, unless you like people thinking and not speaking.  Final Score: 2/10"

56,luxor,audience,2.0,n,The film is a bit tedious. The main character is difficult to relate to and the story is weak. I did enjoy the views of Luxor but found the movie much too dull.
57,luxor,audience,3.0,p,"The film follows a doctor, played by Andrea Riseborough, recuperating from working in a war zone.  She meanders around ancient Egyptian temples in Luxor, a place she is familiar with.  The writer-director Zeina Durra captures her dislocation from her current surroundings and her attempts to reconnect through the two-thousand-year history in which she is immersed.  However, despite the unique and stunning location, this is also a fairly painful process for the viewer and is ultimately unengaging and unmemorable."
58,luxor,audience,0.5,n,"Complete waste of time and money, avoid and watch paint dry instead. Depressive main character never cheers up, no story, dull travelogue for Egyptian tourist sites. Film ends with no evident solution but relief for the viewer that it's over. Avoid."

75,surge,critics,fresh,p,None of this can be viewed as fun. Surge is a downer from start to finish. But it is also hugely effective.
76,surge,critics,rotten,n,"Surge does not raise further questions for the viewer, it feels like a straight-ahead story about a man who is suffering from a mental health collapse."
77,surge,critics,fresh,p,It crosses the line between the anxiety-inducing and the merely irritating in sticking us with a hero whose nervous breakdown is showy but meaningless.
78,surge,critics,fresh,p,"It's gripping, even if we're already worn out halfway in."

82,surge,critics,fresh,p,"The intensity of Surge's scattered, myopic realism isn't for naught. Even with its familiar visual and dramatic approach, the movie packs an odd little punch."
83,surge,critics,fresh,p,"Surge is a thrilling first-person rush, one that takes us head-first into the chaotic state of mind of someone who's finally reached their breaking point."
84,surge,critics,rotten,n,"Ben Whishaw makes for an ideal portrait of a mild-mannered bundle of frustration, but there is an urgency missing from this story that would have effectively put us within the mindset of someone who has finally lost it."
85,surge,critics,fresh,p,What Surge achieves most impressively of all is how it pulls us into the sensory experience of being completely overwhelmed to the point where it untethers Joseph from reality entirely
86,surge,critics,rotten,n,"Some audience members may very well be looking for this brand of sadism (Joker fans, I suppose), but most will find it grating. There's nothing edifying or satisfying about Joseph's crime spree... and there's really no point at all."

88,surge,critics,rotten,n,"Some might find catharsis in this depiction of middle-class rebellion, but it lacks a method to the madness."

91,surge,critics,fresh,p,"What follows is a series of increasingly manic actions that will mesmerize you, especially because of Ben Whishaw's utterly brilliant performance as Joseph. It's acting taken to an entirely new level."
92,surge,critics,fresh,p,"A ferocious showcase for Whishaw, who's never been nervier, and a promising first feature from a filmmaker with energy to spare."
93,surge,audience,0.5,n,Awful plot without progression nor explanation of the different mood change whilst he still retaining normal thought process and never gets caught.... Also the fact he was able to get up right after being hit in an auto accidental.... Beggars version of Split ?
94,surge,audience,2.5,n,"Want to watch a movie about a guy losing his mind? Well, here you go.
""Descent into madness"" movies are nothing new, from ""The Shining"" to ""Taxi Driver"" and scores of others that did it far better than ""Surge."" 
Played with manic abandon by Ben Whishaw, Joseph is a neurotic, discontented guy in London who works as a security checker at the airport, has a parlous relationship with his parents, and bites into a water glass just because he's frustrated with his prosaic life. 
One day, Joseph goes nuts at work and walks off his job. He goes to an attractive co-worker's flat to help her hook her laptop computer to her TV, but when he runs to a nearby store to get a cable, his debit card doesn't work. He tries an ATM, but it eats his card. So he robs a bank (without a gun). Then, he fixes his friend's TV, has sex with her, and robs another bank. Later, he checks into a luxury hotel, completely trashes the room (including ripping open the mattress and climbing inside), and he crashes a wedding party.
Is he rebelling against the constraints of society, or is he just insane? I suppose that's the big, existential question the movie poses, but I honestly didn't care. 
The jerky, hand-held camera work is intended to portray Joseph's disjointed mental state, but it's nothing but artifice. In several scenes, the cameraman literally shakes the camera back and forth. Thirty minutes into this movie, I was dying for a mounted camera, or at least a Steadicam.
This is the kind of movie that pretentious, artsy Sundance types consider ""revolutionary"" and ""daring."" (Whishaw won a Sundance Special Jury award for his acting).
Four stars for Whishaw's committed performance. He really does knock himself out. One star for the annoying cinematography."
95,surge,audience,5.0,p,"If you want to understand mania, watch this film."
96,surge,audience,2.5,n,It was good but also lost in it's overt pace. Nausea accompanies the jumpy camera work and that makes for a point drop to me. I get it. You want us to feel his angst. But I want to watch a movie not feel ill whilst doing so.
97,surge,audience,5.0,p,The most original and captivating film I've seen in years! Just brilliant!
98,surge,audience,5.0,p,Ben Whishaw dances with the camera. Brilliant filmmaking.
99,surge,audience,3.5,p,"Whishaw has always been on my radar since The Perfumier. Unfortunately he doesn't get much work like this due to the dense expectations of the current movie goers. He's exceptional here, playing an individual who has low expectations of himself due to disparaging parents and workmates who don't allow him to fit in ( been there ). Rather than a descent into madness, it's more about his epiphany and doing things that allow him to break the shackles and announce himself in a rather non standard fashion. The perfect example being the scene with the mattress, very clever."

103,promising_young_woman,critics,rotten,n,"In a strange combination of drama and satire, I didn't find Promising Young Woman to be either revolutionary, nor funny. It lacked the courage to show the true horrors behind its truth. Mulligan is tremendous. [Full review in Spanish]"
104,promising_young_woman,critics,fresh,p,"It's certainly not everyone's cup of tea, and is perhaps not as original as it thinks it is. However, as a thriller exploring what happens when one decides to take justice into their own hands, it's strikingly unforgettable."

120,promising_young_woman,critics,fresh,p,Carey Mulligan shines in a colorful twist to revenge movies. [Full Review in Spanish]
121,promising_young_woman,audience,4.0,p,"Pretty good, but cheesy at times"
122,promising_young_woman,audience,5.0,p,"The movie Promising Young Women, directed by Emerald Fennel in 2020, starred Carey Mulligan & Bo Burnham. Is about Cassie a empowered feminist women getting revenge on men who took advantage of her best friend while she was drunk. She makes men feel morally wrong for taking advantage of vulnerable women who are blackout drunk, but she acts to be drunk at bars to then trick the men that go after her, and threatens them to not go after women who are drunk just to have sex with them. But her main goal was to go after the guys who raped her best frined by linking up with her past ""friends"" and she blackmails and manipulates people into giving in and feeling guilt for what they did and not speaking up about it.

One aspect that stood out to me would be the music and lighting. Because the music supported the emotions and actions that were going on in the scenes. Especially when she confronts the people that she is looking for and targeting.

I feel like the movie was well made overall and it can seem sort of dark at times. But its a very solid movie that shows the intentions of men that see vulnerable women as a thing they can exploit for their own pleasure. Which happens in the real world and many get away with it because there's no ""proof"" so to say, And I would recommend this to other people of age to watch it because the movie is constantly making you guess what's going to happen next with unexpected turn of events."
123,promising_young_woman,audience,3.5,p,"Let me start by saying trigger warning as this film contains difficult subjects such as rape and assault. The film is dark and unique (sick at times).  Major parts of the plot is predictable, yet an entertaining thriller that will have you wondering how it'll all end."
124,promising_young_woman,audience,5.0,p,"Wow! This movie is absolutely astonishing with surprising plot twists and suspense that makes it hard to breathe. The music is the kicker here. This is by far the most creative use of pop songs in a movie I have ever heard and it just adds another layer of perfection to it. On top of that, the movie is about an important issue and makes you think long after you finished watching it."
125,promising_young_woman,audience,4.5,p,"Promising Young Women is a thriller/comedy directed by Emerald Fennell in 2020. This film stars Carey Mulligan, Bo Burnham, Alison Brie, and Clancey Brown. Promising Young Women takes place in suburban Ohio. Cassie Thomas who is played by Carey Mulligan was a medical student. She dropped out of medical school and she worked at a coffee shop after. She dropped out to comfort her best friend, Nina. Nina was also a medical student, but she was raped by a fellow colleague. No one believed Nina's story of rape, except Cassie. Nina eventually fell into a depression and this led to her death, suicide. Nina's death traumatized Cassie. This caused the beginning of Cassie's revenge story where she would go to bars alone, act drunk, and then she would lure men to see if they would take advantage of her. That is where everything all began.
	One thing that stood out to me was how the medical students Ryan and Al both knew that they did wrong, but they made the excuse that they were ""just kids"". Al raped Nina while she was drunk and passed out. Ryan took part in the assault by watching and he recorded everything when he had the power to stop it. They were both grown men with successful medical practices, but they both acted like they should have been exempt from all the trauma that they caused since they were ""just kids"". 
I really liked the film, Promising Young Women because the director, Emerald Fennell, did a good job of keeping the audience guessing. There were many plot twists throughout the film. I really believed that Bo Burnham's character, Ryan, was going to change Cassie for the better. I thought that her nights of going out to bars and acting drunk were going to come to an end because of him. He really liked her and she started to like him as well, but everything was ruined when Cassie found out that he was involved in Nina's assault. This really surprised me because I thought he was good. I really liked how throughout the film I could not tell if Cassie was depressed or actually psychotic. The quality of the movie was good, the lighting was different from all the other films that I have watched. I would recommend this movie to young viewers like myself because it shows a very serious topic in a somewhat comedic way. I would give this film 4.5/5 stars."
126,promising_young_woman,audience,3.5,p,"It's a good story, just a bit heavy handed.
But it's definitely watchable."
127,promising_young_woman,audience,5.0,p,I was very impressed by this movie. It's a very entertaining and thought provoking film. My congratulations to Emerald Fennell and the cast for a movie well done.
128,promising_young_woman,audience,4.0,p,Love the concept! The movie was great. Didn't get five because the ending was kinda weird not what you were expecting.
129,promising_young_woman,audience,4.5,p,"Interesting, great performances and thrilling to the end."
130,promising_young_woman,audience,4.0,p,"What goes around comes around.  An obsession never ends well.  Carey is on a quest to right a wrong from her friend and her past.  The men and the women who laughed at a girl being drugged drunk, raped and beaten are sick, beyond sick.  Girls watch it and alcohol ALWAYS clouds the picture and you hope you have a nice guy.  I took several drunken girls home in my time and believe me I could of but what I could not do afterward would be to live with myself if I did.  However, how many guys and women could???"
131,the_go_gos,critics,fresh,p,"The Go-Go's is a punchy, vibrant look at the quintet who stormed punk stages (even if it was just for a minute, Belinda Carlisle was one of The Germs and Gina Schock played drums for Edith Massey) and set pop records."
132,the_go_gos,critics,fresh,p,"A refreshing film with some great insight in to instant fame, and the eighties."
133,the_go_gos,critics,fresh,p,"That it's hardly groundbreaking or seriously in-depth is likely the source of its charm -- in just under two hours it provides a surprisingly satisfying ""Behind the Music""-style survey of the career of a fascinating and criminally underrated band."
134,the_go_gos,critics,fresh,p,"Directed by Alison Ellwood, The Go-Go's delivers everything you'd want out of a rock doc."
135,the_go_gos,critics,fresh,p,Anyone skeptical of serious musicianship coexisting with pop effervescence should seal their lips upon watching The Go-Go's.
136,the_go_gos,critics,fresh,p,"As director Alison Ellwood shows in her briskly entertaining documentary -- The Go-Go's -- the band's members can explain away, with enormous charm, the naked ambition that made them the most successful ""girl group"" ever."
137,the_go_gos,critics,fresh,p,"The doc's goal: Don't think of the Go-Go's as a bit of Reagan-era nostalgia, the musical equivalent of a Rubik's cube. Think of them as a first-tier, kick-ass rock group, period, full stop, the end. Mission accomplished."
138,the_go_gos,critics,fresh,p,"""The Go-Go's"" is an entertaining and well-put together package on a musical group who should command the respect of their male peers."
139,the_go_gos,critics,fresh,p,Perhaps this film and the buzz surrounding it can finally deliver the accolades and recognition The Go-Go's so richly deserve.
140,the_go_gos,critics,fresh,p,"Even though the Go-Go's story has been told before (and some would say better) on Behind the Music, this documentary is interesting enough, but not essential, for people who want an overall history of the band."
141,the_go_gos,critics,fresh,p,The band deserves this fine film.
142,the_go_gos,critics,fresh,p,Anyone with even a passing interest in the Go-Go's... must watch Alison Ellwood's documentary.
143,the_go_gos,critics,fresh,p,"The Go-Go's have not yet been awarded their proper place [in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]... After the world sees Alison Ellwood's splendid documentary, that omission is bound to be put to rights."
144,the_go_gos,critics,fresh,p,[Director Alison] Ellwood ultimately shows the group as a proper rock band without the female asterisk; you're left seeing more than some all-female blip in musical history.
145,the_go_gos,critics,fresh,p,"Watching the film, it's pure pleasure to witness such scrappy exuberance, such mayhem so enthusiastically pursued."
146,the_go_gos,critics,fresh,p,"Overall, The Go-Go's is an amazing biopic of a band with a great story, chronicling the great stories of the individuals who made it all happen."
147,the_go_gos,critics,fresh,p,"Combining in-depth interviews ... and copious archival footage, Ellwood paints a three-dimensional portrait of the group and their ascension to the summit of fame and success."
148,the_go_gos,critics,fresh,p,They still Got the Beat.
149,the_go_gos,critics,fresh,p,"This film isn't always ""upbeat,"" but it is honest. It's the story of a still underrated, pioneering rock band - who, like a lot of pioneers, sometimes got a little lost."
150,the_go_gos,critics,fresh,p,A fine tribute to an immortal band.
151,the_go_gos,audience,5.0,p,Amazing documentary about The Go-Go's! Really interesting to learn the story of how they started out. They are a very special group of ladies!! And one of the greatest bands ever!!
152,the_go_gos,audience,4.5,p,"What a nifty documentary that felt authentic and not a whitewashing of history.  A refreshing trip back in time for the all-female pop band, The Go-Gos.  If you're into 80s rock you'll like the inside story.  There are some candid tales in this heartfelt journey.  You have to love a doc where even the people who may be part of the history, but may not like the central figures are honest about the good times and the bad times.  A fantastic film!  Final Score: 8.8/10"
153,the_go_gos,audience,4.0,p,Actually better than the band. Served as a great tour of the late 70's early 80's LA punk and Indi scene.
154,the_go_gos,audience,5.0,p,Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!
155,the_go_gos,audience,5.0,p,This movie is a great story of not only the origins and formation of one of the greatest rock and roll bands of all time but also a great story of friendships and sisterhood and the bonds friends make and how through adversity that bond is always there!!!
156,the_go_gos,audience,5.0,p,"Great doc about the early days until their original breakup of this band. I want to see more. The movie ends at 1984. Fun footage, and excellent interviews."
157,the_go_gos,audience,5.0,p,"The Go-Go's.  I had a great interest in seeing this documentary film because I am, and was a dedicated fan since the 1980's, the beginning of the Go-Go's career.  Full disclosure: I was a huge Go-Go's fan.  So, no surprise that I watched the premiere of the documentary on the day it was released, July 31, 2020.  Since then, I have seen the film 4 times.  I rated this documentary high for the following reasons:
1.  I felt like the director brought in authentic truthful comments from the people portrayed in the film, mainly the artists that worked with the Go-Go's and the Go-Go's themselves.  There was no ""real-life but scripted"" feeling at all.
2.  The documentary's background history of the Go-Go's was something new and fresh that I had never known before as a young fan; and I found it fascinating that I really didn't know a lot about the Go-GO's , who they were, their talents, their story,  and where they came from.
3.  I saw so much in this documentary that would be familiar to a genuine fan but I also saw new photos, news-clippings, and video that I had never seen before.

When the documentary was over, my immediate reaction was I  felt like it was too short and I wanted more. It also made me happy and I knew I would watch it again."
158,the_go_gos,audience,5.0,p,A favorite documentary of the year. I love the Go-Gos and their story but I love this telling of it. There is great humor and care and love in all of it. I look forward to watching it again
159,the_go_gos,audience,3.5,p,"I was never a big fan back in the day but I wasnt a hater either. I liked some of their tunes. What I found appealing about this doc was the humble, yet brutal honesty. Not just about their R&R lifestyle, fame, or breakup which had the usual traps, but their honesty that the sanctity of music wasnt the driving force behind their formation. That it was the punk/ska scene they just wanted to be a part of and music was but a means to an end. One of them says basically ""We sucked. But we didnt care. Nobody did. It was punk. We just plugged in and played and whatever happened, happened."" Not exactly a Prince or Buddy Holly perfectionist, respect the craft mindset. But its who they were and they didnt deny it. It wasnt until they added a few key pieces that the musicianship, work ethic, and quality elevated...which ultimately paid off. I also respect their Pioneer legacy and the guts it took to make some of the uncomfortable decisions & changes they had to make to become what they did. Its not ""If I Leave Here Tomorrow"" but its still a good music doc definitely recommended."
160,the_go_gos,audience,4.5,p,"I was never huge Go Gos fan. Simply enjoyed their ugly pop songs. This documentary has given me a much better appreciation for their music, the women behind that music, their achievements and struggles. I was moved."
161,bad_hair_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The film isn't quite as trashy as you might like, but it scratches all the itches you might want scratched by a movie about a killer weave. Bring on the sequel."
162,bad_hair_2020,critics,rotten,n,What began as social commentary about the pressures Black women are placed under to transform our hair... turned into a scathing and rather insulting critique of Black women and our culture of protective styling.
163,bad_hair_2020,critics,rotten,n,"""Bad Hair"" is interesting because of its subject matter and its denunciations, but will probably not satisfy the majority of horror fans."
164,bad_hair_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Whilst the genre elements are purposely over the top and often more amusing than scary, the stylish Bad Hair does a great job of getting its message across."
165,bad_hair_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Dripping with satirical comments, including the title, throughout the film, Justin Simien knows exactly what he wants to say and how to say it."
166,bad_hair_2020,critics,rotten,n,"In his quest to create a fable about Black women's hair, Simien overlooks the actual function it plays in Black women's lives, opting instead for a superficial finger wag about the value and importance of natural beauty."
167,bad_hair_2020,critics,fresh,p,BAD HAIR is successful at showing all the steps along the way to giving up what makes you special as a person to obey society's demands that you become one of the many.
168,bad_hair_2020,critics,rotten,n,There are sparks here and there but the film mostly fails to deliver thrill or commentary in the right dose.
169,bad_hair_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Aside from the excruciating hair weave operation, and the pain that follows, I found much of this dark comedy amusing, just because it is so off-the-wall crazy."
170,bad_hair_2020,critics,fresh,p,This undercurrent of darker humour balances the silliness of some of the hair attack scenes and ensures that the film succeeds as both horror and comedy whilst having more to say than most of what emerges from either genre.
171,bad_hair_2020,critics,rotten,n,A Black experience film whose horror satire is good for a few laughs.
172,bad_hair_2020,critics,fresh,p,It's a weave that has a thirst for blood. What's not fun about that?
173,bad_hair_2020,critics,fresh,p,Socio-politics and cultural relevance are just part of Simien's obvious admiration for horror movie heritage. Bad Hair is delightfully old school.
174,bad_hair_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Quite simply, this is a fun film with a message, and some suitably-ropey special effects that should have been made in 1989 but thankfully has finally been made in 2020."
175,bad_hair_2020,critics,fresh,p,"We liked a lot about this movie at #Sundance2020 and this final (shorter!) version is even better. A fun, campy, referential horror film about a weave with its own ambitions - #BadHair has a lot of social commentary, but has fun while saying it."
176,bad_hair_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Funny satire has social commentary, gore, sex, and language."
177,bad_hair_2020,critics,fresh,p,"There's always room for another spin of the Faustian wheel, and this clever throwback to late-'80s psycho-thrillers is a worthy addition to the field."
178,bad_hair_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The script tries too hard in some areas but not hard enough in others, but on the whole, it's a refreshing genre take on intraracial politics -- like School Daze meets The Exorcist."
179,bad_hair_2020,critics,rotten,n,"Bad Hair works as a delivery device for well-worn but effective creepshow kookiness, but its politics are muddled and faintly mean-spirited."
180,bad_hair_2020,critics,rotten,n,"Bad Hair isn't a bad movie. Few of 2020's horror pictures are, for better or for worse, this memorable. But in the end, Simien's execution doesn't match his ambitions."
181,bad_hair_2020,audience,3.5,p,I absolutely loved it! An excellent 90s style horror with some cultural commentary. A little bit of comedy and a little gore to keep the story going.
182,bad_hair_2020,audience,5.0,p,"Loved it, people say it's a finger wagging at black womens protective styles. It's not. It's a camp horror. I'm a black woman who has worn weaves, and who no longer does. I can laugh at it without it being a criticism of black women. It has a message, I got that message. Interpret how you will but I thought it was fun!"
183,bad_hair_2020,audience,3.5,p,"I like folk-tale horror, I like cheesy jump-scares and cool one-liners, I liked Bad Hair and will show it to more people on easy late nights."
184,bad_hair_2020,audience,0.5,n,super cringe execution. premise a bit lame.
185,bad_hair_2020,audience,1.0,n,Was like watching a lobotomy
186,bad_hair_2020,audience,3.5,p,I liked this but I feel like it could've been a little more powerful if it was just slightly less campy? Also it's wild to me that nobody figured out the fix for so long lol
187,bad_hair_2020,audience,2.0,n,Honestly the best part of the movie was the trailer. Started off interesting and then got incredibly convoluted. Basically everyone had the same hair...apparently.
188,bad_hair_2020,audience,2.5,n,"5/10. I commend this movie for it's social commentary - even if it lacks subtlety, there is a unique perspective explored in some creative and insightful ways. But for a film billing itself as a horror/comedy, it isn't at all scary, and aside from a few throwaway lines, the biggest laughs (which are few) derive from the B-movie caliber horror effects. There is a solid foundation that the right creative team might have made something great with, but what we are left with is a film that's demand to be taken seriously is muted by it's mediocrity."
189,bad_hair_2020,audience,2.0,n,"The movie starts off with an interesting premise, a black perspective on issue of image politics.  A black girl being pressured to change her look to that of white corperate america, gets a sew in weave that changes her life, litterally... but not in the way she wanted.  {insert horror string swell}....

The first act of the movie starts off promising, the late 80's setting and initial character development were all well done, but the middle of the film towards the begining of the 3rd act things start falling apart quickly.  

The plot points/lore behind the hair are never really fleshed out very well, and are never explored beyond a few vague scenes. This is a missed opportunity as it really could have made the lore of feel a lot more important, and gave more weight to overall story.  Overall, the second half of the film feels rushed and thrown together.  During the climax, the settings and character motivations stop making sense. The visual effects were pretty trash for a film in released in 2020. From the prosthetic scar from relaxer in the first scene, to the gore from various scenes after, they were all pretty lame looking, and thats unfortunate because the overall cinematography and visual style were great overall.  The quality of editing also took a nose dive during the 3rd act as well.  

Although there are some glaring weak points, I did enjoy the cast.  the actors, and actress did an excellent job, considering what they were given to work with."
190,bad_hair_2020,audience,1.0,n,"I get that it's suppose to be comedic but it just comes off poorly done and not funny. The story is also weak, with the message that anything other than natural black hair is evil.  On top of all that the horror aspect isn't good either with poor effects and just overall cornyness that doesn't seem intentional."
191,run_sweetheart_run,critics,fresh,p,RUN SWEETHEART RUN is a multi-layered and very personal portrait of a woman in danger and a bold feminist statement of women's lot in life and the inherent danger of being a woman that society frequently glosses over.
192,run_sweetheart_run,critics,fresh,p,Run Sweetheart Run is a fun and well-paced horror that makes for good fun despite its ambitions being far beyond reach.
193,run_sweetheart_run,critics,fresh,p,"The first two-thirds of Run Sweetheart Run is hella fun for genre fans, a relentless cat-and-mouse game that is elevated by a strong and physical performance from Balinska, who makes for an empathetic and compelling protagonist."
194,run_sweetheart_run,critics,fresh,p,A highly entertaining and tense game of cat-and-mouse that quickly reveals its cat to be of the supernatural variety.
195,run_sweetheart_run,critics,fresh,p,"Ella Balinska stars as the ""first and final girl"" in writer/director Shana Feste's horror film, filled with visceral thrills and real-world commentary."
196,run_sweetheart_run,critics,rotten,n,"A slick, flashy and trashy genre hash too knuckleheaded to be much fun even as a guilty pleasure."
197,run_sweetheart_run,critics,fresh,p,Run Sweetheart Run is broadly successful in trying to have genre thrills with a feminist premise that becomes more and more obvious.
198,run_sweetheart_run,critics,rotten,n,"Run Sweetheart Run tries to be a feminist horror movie while focusing on a wholly uninteresting protagonist whose most defining traits are, yes, her maternity and her menstrual cycle."
199,run_sweetheart_run,critics,fresh,p,"Feste flips the script on femininity in horror, unabashedly wielding the female body to her protagonist's advantage."

201,run_sweetheart_run,critics,rotten,n,"It's not all bad with Run Sweetheart Run, but it's bad enough."
202,run_sweetheart_run,critics,fresh,p,"A lighthearted survive-the-night style romp. One that's unafraid to convey what it's like to be female, but with enough playfulness and horror to feel inclusive for all. Centered around a woman's curse, it guarantees to be divisive."
203,run_sweetheart_run,critics,fresh,p,Run Sweetheart Run is an exhilarating horror flick and a scorching social commentary.
204,run_sweetheart_run,critics,fresh,p,"""Run Sweetheart Run"" isn't just about how it feels to be violated by a single person in a position of power, but how the prevailing power structures can continue to enforce and expand those same violations."
205,run_sweetheart_run,critics,fresh,p,"Confronts toxic masculinity and patriarchy head-on, like an atomic bomb full of social and political horror."
0,the_fight_2020,critics,fresh,p,How hard is the ACLU fighting? This hard.
1,the_fight_2020,critics,fresh,p,"It's tough as a viewer to treat every ideology equally when there is a clear faction inflicting or invoking harm... The film mostly avoids reckoning with this, except in the Charlottesville case, which does not give a satisfying conclusion"
2,the_fight_2020,critics,fresh,p,"...what we have is an eminently well-meaning call to arms, with a closing reminder from the subjects that it's not lawyers but We, the People, who can turn things around."
3,the_fight_2020,critics,rotten,n,Jamming all of this into a brief documentary results in a shallow montage of soundbites.
4,the_fight_2020,critics,fresh,p,It's a solid film if you care to see the inner workings of the ACLU.
5,the_fight_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Reminds us that all is not lost, that there remains an opportunity to right even the worst wrongs and that...even the most insurmountable obstacles can be overcome."
6,the_fight_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Very informative. It's not an ""eat your vegetables"" thing at all; it is shot and cut very thrillingly and you really come to care and appreciate the hard work that these folks put in."
7,the_fight_2020,critics,fresh,p,It's a fairly thrilling and gut-wrenching examination of how these things work.
8,the_fight_2020,critics,fresh,p,The Fight allows us to see the humanity of these lawyers and their role in the high stakes battle for what American democracy is and what it might become.
9,the_fight_2020,critics,fresh,p,"This is a movie for everyone who believes in the law, who appreciates the complex American legal system, and who relishes judicial combat."
10,the_fight_2020,critics,fresh,p,"A hugely engrossing, intellectually stimulating achievement that will leave viewers torn between hope and despair."
11,the_fight_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The Fight excels at presenting these attorneys working under the pressure of defending our civil rights, and the burden it places on them and their families."
12,the_fight_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Separately, any of the cases and causes could be a documentary onto itself, but collectively, it is absolutely raw and riveting. To say that The Fight is timely and necessary is an understatement."
13,the_fight_2020,critics,fresh,p,"An engaging, quick-paced film."
14,the_fight_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The Fight is a documentary about how the ACLU is working hard to make sure ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" doesn't become just ""the pursuit"" under President Trump."
15,the_fight_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Many documentaries capture the times under the Trump administration, but few films so accurately convey the exasperating insanity of keeping up with it."
16,the_fight_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The Fight probably won't change a lot of people's political opinions. However, for anyone interested in what politically liberal attorneys at the ACLU are doing behind the scenes ... The Fight offers an insightful peek into this process."
17,the_fight_2020,critics,fresh,p,Compelling documentary about the ACLU and its attorneys.
18,the_fight_2020,critics,fresh,p,"It's worthy, educational, ambitious, sometimes depressing and occasionally even fun, even if it doesn't have the ability to be comprehensive."
19,the_fight_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Despite its frequent slides into insulting disingenuousness, however, the film's sheer strength of character keeps it truly engaging, as it describes an important roadmap to a far better world."
20,the_fight_2020,audience,3.5,p,Good documentary. Good choices on the content to include. Nice camera work. Glad they included the video of Charlottesville. Even more glad that the reality of what was actually going on is clear in each case. 3.5 stars
21,the_fight_2020,audience,4.0,p,"An impassioned look at an organization whose sole purpose is to fight for civil liberties under the constitution.

30,herself,critics,fresh,p,"The movie is a well-crafted, soulfully acted glimpse at what victims of abuse suffer."
31,herself,critics,fresh,p,Director Phyllidia Lloyd (Mamma Mia!) does a masterful job of bringing Sandra's experiences together into an immensely watchable and frequently touching narrative.
32,herself,critics,fresh,p,"It's got foundations rooted in reality. The body off the house is in-between the dream and the fulfillment, and it's roof has its head in the air...I enjoyed it very much."
33,herself,critics,fresh,p,"Lloyd makes something genuinely nightmarish of the worst attacks, but Dunne's creased vulnerability ... keeps us tethered to waking reality."
34,herself,critics,fresh,p,Ultimately uplifting in every sense...
35,herself,critics,fresh,p,"Two parts reality, one part wishful thinking, Herself is heartfelt, female-driven, people-positive and mostly feelgood. But bring tissues."
36,herself,critics,fresh,p,"Slightly too good to be true at times, it's nevertheless rather lovely."
37,herself,critics,rotten,n,"Dunne, who also co-wrote the script, brings admirable grit and pathos to her character without allowing her to become a victim. Still, the film's abrupt tonal shifts are jarring."
38,herself,critics,fresh,p,"Dunne is an outstanding lead, whose emphatic performance is bolstered by the always reliable Walter and Hill."
39,herself,critics,fresh,p,"Herself is smart in the way it balances the importance of individual charity and the need for wider reform - one provides the hope, the other provides the answers."
40,herself,critics,fresh,p,"Both harrowing and heartwarming, Herself tackles the issues of domestic abuse and the Irish housing crisis with a deep sense of humanity and hope."
41,herself,critics,fresh,p,"Herself is upsetting and inspiring in equal measure, and Dunne, who co-wrote the screenplay, is excellent as a cornered but resilient woman whose story is all too universal."
42,herself,critics,fresh,p,A... schematically uplifting story about rebuilding a life and having faith in the inherent goodness of others.
43,herself,critics,fresh,p,Lloyd's radical fairytale is enchanting.
44,herself,critics,fresh,p,"Ultimately, Herself will break your heart but it will also put it back together again."
45,herself,critics,fresh,p,"This is never maudlin and never tips into sentimentality. Lloyd's direction is so sure and restrained that she somehow manages to balance the raw, hard-hitting, viscerally impactful scenes with the lighter, hopeful ones."
46,herself,critics,fresh,p,Mamma Mia! director Phyllida Lloyd takes a welcome swerve into social realism for this visceral drama...
47,herself,critics,fresh,p,"Can the film's potentially unstable mixture of cruelty and kindness hold? The unlikely answer is that yes, it does."
48,herself,critics,fresh,p,"There's a strong basis of originality here, and the warmth and good nature of the movie carries it along."
49,herself,critics,fresh,p,"Herself tells a compelling story, but combining a tough realist drama about domestic abuse and homelessness with an optimistic tale of solidarity weakens the foundations of this otherwise admirable film."
50,herself,audience,4.5,p,"Well acted and probably fairly accurate depiction of a woman's struggle to leave an abusive relationship. Good cast.   I saw this film at an independent art space, why do the big multiplexes ignore the unusual films in lieu of wall-to-wall blockbusters?  It deserved a bigger audience."
51,herself,audience,5.0,p,"Excellent film. It stayed with me awhile after viewing it. I thought the script was very well done, as was the acting. A story very well told. Hats off to everyone involved."
52,herself,audience,2.0,n,"FARFETCHED.  Although the acting was alright, the whole plot was completely far fetched  and not plausible.  Waste of my time."
53,herself,audience,4.5,p,"There is a balance of sweet, inspirational moments with dramatic, downright heartbreaking moments to match this perspective all too much with reality and a glimmer of hope."
54,herself,audience,5.0,p,Fabulous film. Well acted and an important story
55,herself,audience,4.5,p,"HERSELF is brilliant. Rather than focusing on the physical and emotional violence perpetrated against Sandra, the movie explores the incredible challenges faced by a mum with two children who, after escaping from her abusive husband, has to navigate a bureaucracy that does little to really support her. But with the help of friends and others who genuinely care, she is able to rebuild her life and become herself.
Clare Dunn (who also co-wrote the screenplay) is stunning as the mother and Molly McCann and Ruby Rose O'Hara are totally convincing as her two kids. This story, while harrowing, is such a refreshing change to the typical Hollywood take on domestic violence. It's a relatively slowly told story but it is riveting as it digs deep into the emotional and social toll that survivors of abusive relationships experience.
The story is told with incredible sensitivity, empathy, and without exploitation. I can't recommend this one highly enough."
56,herself,audience,5.0,p,"As a child who grew up in a home with domestic abuse, I have to admit that Dunne's Sandra is the mother I've always dreamed of having. How she can continue to push even after all she's been through wouldn't even be humanly possible for someone like me. The extensive physical and emotional abuse that she suffered, only to surpass, and be hit with even more battles is honestly tiring. Tiring, but in a good way. It takes a toll on the viewer thanks to Lloyd's directing skills, and makes whoever is watching glad that they aren't in Sandra's shoes. It's exhausting watching her go through all of that hurt, so we can only imagine how exhausting it is actually living through it. That is the best way I can sum up this move— tiring, but in a good way."
57,herself,audience,3.5,p,"Another story of the evils of man, a husband who treats his wife and daughters and things rather than people. Great cast. Sad at times, victorious at other times."
58,herself,audience,5.0,p,"The beautiful performance of Clare Dunne is the best you will see of this film since it is one of the best films at the beginning of the year, because it writes and portrays a difficult story to see, that you will feel a very painful experience, but if you have patience, it will be the most emotional, perfect and glorious thing that anyone has ever seen, and that will lead her to be recognized in Hollywood and I hope to see her in more movies, since this one offers a great example for all women, who will feel identified, together with a great message that you should know: the only way to feel free is to reconnect with the most important person in your life: yourself."
59,herself,audience,4.5,p,"Great performances all around, but Clare Dunne was sensational!"

93,crip_camp,critics,fresh,p,"Crip Camp is the kind of documentary whose name circulates in must-watch lists for months: it's an inspiring true story, accessibly told."
94,crip_camp,critics,fresh,p,"Chronicling the rise and ultimate passage of the Civil Rights Act, this is a film that brings previously unsung heroes to the forefront and helps show commonalities between the able and disabled."
95,crip_camp,critics,fresh,p,"This documentary sneaks up on you, grabbing your interest with music and history, but keeping it with the candid footage of souls, both young and old, asking for acceptance."
96,crip_camp,critics,fresh,p,The heart and soul of Crip Camp is about the healing power of an accepting community and the ways such a community can change the lives of those who belong.
97,crip_camp,critics,fresh,p,Crip Camp is an extraordinary look at a segment of society whose national campaign for civil rights largely flew under the radar.
98,crip_camp,critics,fresh,p,"You will tear up watching the marchers climb out of their wheelchairs and crawl up the steps of the U.S. Capitol. ""I don't care if it takes me all day,"" a courageous child shouts as he climbs one step at a time like a real-life ""Rocky."""
99,crip_camp,critics,fresh,p,The title of Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution is somewhat misleading because the movie is more about the 'revolution' than it is about the 'camp.' The movie itself is an inspiring but unevenly edited documentary.
100,crip_camp,audience,4.5,p,"Summary: Camp Jened was more than just a summer camp. Here, teens with disabilities, exhausted from living in the margins, could finally be their true selves. As campers grew, so did their friendships and their activism.

Takeaways: From Camp Jened to Washington D.C., Judy Heumann and others became civil rights advocates for people with disabilities. When U.S. leaders refused to sign Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (one of the first federal civil rights laws to ensure certain rights and accessibility for people with disabilities) the longest sit-in demonstration was born."
101,crip_camp,audience,4.0,p,Incredible.  Makes you feel like you're one of those people just taking up space in this world.
102,crip_camp,audience,5.0,p,Powerful to watch. Very humbling to see the struggle these people faced to create a better future.
103,crip_camp,audience,5.0,p,This was the best documentary of the year! I learned so much and have such a new respect for their achievements!
104,crip_camp,audience,4.0,p,"From the title, you would not know that the Camp story is the lead into the larger (and longer) story of the fight for the civil rights of the disabled.  (In which several of the campers became pivotal figures.)
Having worked in Easter Seal and private camps for the disabled in my youth, similarly situated in rural New Jersey, the camp scenes were bittersweet reminders of the people we lived and worked with and the often incandescent optimism they radiated under heartbreaking circumstances. I also worked for a short time in state run 'hospital' for the disabled, a less uplifting experience. The continuing story of rights for the disabled reminds us of the way things used to be in the (not so) ""good old days"", how far we have come as a society, and how far there is still left to go."
105,crip_camp,audience,3.0,p,"I think ""Crip Camp"" defiantly has an important story to tell, but the documentary is barely about the camp itself. I understand the camp was a huge influence for most of the disabled rights activists, I just wished they explored that more than 'this is where the future activist camped for a summer'."
106,crip_camp,audience,3.5,p,Oscar nominated documentary about how a summer camp for teens with disabilities in the 70s led to groundbreaking civil rights gains by the disabled community.  Informative and entertaining.
107,crip_camp,audience,3.5,p,"Interesting coming-of-age story that led to aiding in resilience. The camp is nice background to where these bonds were created and where they were able find themselves. But the most intriguing point of this documentary was the positive public and political changes that it led to. I think the documentary could've benefited from a better focus on ""why"" this story is important--the events around the coming societal changes or the need for more camps (or something similar to camps). Maybe also better psychological understanding of their repression so the antics of the camp make sense to the average viewer. Overall, it's an important story unapologetically told with some charming moments. But something is missing in it for me that would tie it all together with a nicer packaging. Better focus, maybe?"
108,crip_camp,audience,4.0,p,"Fantastic and charming, a beautiful rigid and assembled production."
109,crip_camp,audience,3.5,p,"When the 1960s civil rights movement got into high gear, one constituency seeking equality felt left out -- disabled Americans. But they were not to be denied, and they began finding their voice through a summer camp in the Catskills designed to enable them to experience the feelings of mainstream living. Drawing upon their time here, they would later adapt the lessons learned to push for the equal rights that would eventually become embodied in the Americans with Disabilities Act, an initiative that would go on to have implications internationally. Through a wealth of archive footage and interviews with camp residents and counselors (many of whom were hippies and minorities, themselves seekers of reform and equal rights), directors James Lebrecht and Nicole Newnham tell this little-known story in a revealing and often quite surprising documentary, filled with an array of moments ranging from touching to heartbreaking to inspiring and even hilarious. However, for all its strengths, the film is not without its shortcomings, such as not enough linkage between camp life experience and the legacy it inspired, as well as some less-than-ideal selections of archive footage that seem more incidental than enlightening, material that could have easily been cut. Still, it's indeed captivating to see what can emerge out of humble (and seemingly unrelated) beginnings and the tremendous impact they can have, perhaps the film's greatest asset of all."
110,palm_springs_2020,critics,fresh,p,If you can handle more repetition in the name of fun and entertainment there's actually a lot to be gained from the film's gentle dissection of human foibles and the meaningless nature of time.
111,palm_springs_2020,critics,fresh,p,"What starts as a goofy, skit-like Groundhog Day morphs into a pleasant and interesting existential romance."
112,palm_springs_2020,critics,fresh,p,"In theaters, this kind of brainy weirdo comedy nearly always underperforms. But in the arena of the streaming world, it breaks through and offers you a psychic daiquiri. Good enough."
113,palm_springs_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The chemistry between Samberg and Milioti shines through in one of the funniest, absurdly charming movies of 2020."
114,palm_springs_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The movie comes out of the gate with a speed and charm that's difficult to match. It's fittingly self-reflexive, though, that the movie's only real letdown comes after looping through so much fun."
115,palm_springs_2020,critics,rotten,n,"By the time the end credits roll, Palm Springs has created its own sort of loop: you have seen it all before, and you will likely see it again."
116,palm_springs_2020,critics,fresh,p,"""Others films may have done [the time loop concept] better, but the emotional journey the characters go on is a little different here, and the time loop idea plays into that journey."""
117,palm_springs_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Palm Springs covers the big topic of finding something to live for and the value of companionship, but with a unique goofiness mixed with unexpected poignancy. I"
118,palm_springs_2020,critics,fresh,p,"For while it's certainly not original, it is funny, crowd-pleasing and nicely played out by its two leads, Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti."
119,palm_springs_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Fans of sci-fi, buddy movies, sitcoms and towering love stories alike can rejoice: Palm Springs finds the sweet spot in all of them, understanding love and pain as transcendental, fear and desire as lifeblood."
120,palm_springs_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Play it again, Samberg."
121,palm_springs_2020,critics,fresh,p,This meaty genre subversion brings out its perceptual metaphor of our generational angst and stasis -- and in turn manifests what it takes to better ourselves in a seemingly unworthy and emotionless world of existential dread.
122,palm_springs_2020,critics,fresh,p,"This may just be the most perfect use of 90 minutes of screentime that we've seen in a long time, let alone the best use of a time loop/Groundhog Day narrative."
123,palm_springs_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Surface similarities to Groundhog Day are relegated to background noise, thanks to the crisp writing and the nihilistic bite of the humour."
124,palm_springs_2020,critics,fresh,p,"A philosophical comedy that is not afraid to aim the odd joke below the belt or, as resolution looms, to give in to sentimentality."
125,palm_springs_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The boredom, the dread and the existential terror. It's all there. Only this time it's funny."
126,palm_springs_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Max Barbakow's debut film, written by Andy Siara, offers a new way to look at a familiar format."
127,palm_springs_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Surprisingly, the film is able to tackle some pretty hefty existential issues, all the while offering up a genuinely heartening love story."
128,palm_springs_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Part comedy, part cautionary fable, Palm Springs lands its big ideas as lightly as its punchlines."
129,palm_springs_2020,critics,fresh,p,I'd like to watch it again.
130,palm_springs_2020,audience,3.5,p,Quirky little action comedy that revolves around the same premise as Groundhog Day.  Fun movie that makes you laugh and makes you think.  It is a bit dark on the comedy and feels more like a dramedy most of the time.  I had a better opinion of it once I got through it than I did while it was on.  I think it is worth a look.
131,palm_springs_2020,audience,4.0,p,A hilarious romance that inflicts the same sensations of the drugs digested in the film itself.
132,palm_springs_2020,audience,4.5,p,Fun movie to watch!!
133,palm_springs_2020,audience,5.0,p,"While the characters are stuck in a time loop, I can see myself being stuck watching this movie in a loop. However, I will enjoy it."
134,palm_springs_2020,audience,3.5,p,"A fun Groundhog Day style romantic comedy that sometimes strives to be a little more than what it is and although, not quite failing at it, wouldn't call say it's exactly successful either."
135,palm_springs_2020,audience,3.5,p,"Interesting premise. Brisk opening, suffers a bit from pacing issue afterwards. The ending might not be that satisfying and unforgettable."
136,palm_springs_2020,audience,5.0,p,"Amazing Movie. Its jokes are always perfectly timed and well placed, and they work in quite a few serious events and moments too, there's a really good mix of both of them. I also like he choice of actors, there's very good chemistry between them."
137,palm_springs_2020,audience,4.5,p,"This movie relies on a previously used formula but does it so much better. So many laughs and after this one, I finally get the point of the groundhog day theory."
138,palm_springs_2020,audience,3.5,p,Not the most original story but definitely a good movje
139,palm_springs_2020,audience,2.0,n,"Too simple, predictable and boring. It's a copy of Groundhog Day but not as good."
140,charm_city_kings,critics,rotten,n,TV scribe Sherman Payne's script is as predictable as they come...
141,charm_city_kings,critics,rotten,n,The natural style and authentic locations add a great deal of excitement and purity to 'Charm City Kings.' I just wish the story weren't so predictable.
142,charm_city_kings,critics,fresh,p,"With its challenging performances, elaborate dirt-biking stunts, evocative cinematography, and unique setting for a coming-of-age narrative, it's one of the great gems of 2020."
143,charm_city_kings,critics,fresh,p,Charm City Kings has a lot of heart underpinning the flashy trappings of the bike riders' subculture.
144,charm_city_kings,critics,fresh,p,"The performances, especially by Winston and Mill, are tremendous"
145,charm_city_kings,critics,fresh,p,The title refers to a nickname for Baltimore.
146,charm_city_kings,critics,fresh,p,A fantastic performance from Jahi Di'Allo Winston in this Baltimore based film.
147,charm_city_kings,critics,fresh,p,Powerful drama highlights the power of choices; violence.
148,charm_city_kings,critics,fresh,p,The spirit of old-fashioned coming-of-age fare roars in director Angel Manuel Soto's sun-dappled Charm City Kings.
149,charm_city_kings,critics,fresh,p,"Soto's winning mix of polished style and gritty authenticity, along with Winston's ace screen presence, go a long way toward making Charm City Kings' familiar story stick with us."
150,charm_city_kings,critics,fresh,p,"It may be a familiar coming-of-age story, but it wears its heart on its sleeve with captivating breakout performances to boot."
151,charm_city_kings,critics,fresh,p,"Charm City Kings unearths its timeless ruminations with precision and verve, throttling forward a narrative that is equally impactful and enthralling."
152,charm_city_kings,critics,fresh,p,A really engaging story worth watching for the performances.
153,charm_city_kings,critics,fresh,p,Di'Allo turns in a strong enough performance for me to want to root for him to stay out of trouble.
154,charm_city_kings,critics,fresh,p,"Ultimately, Charm City Kings passes the Baltimore smell test, which is saying a lot."
155,charm_city_kings,critics,rotten,n,"[F]or all the energy both in front of and behind the camera, this thing rides the clutch way too much. It's not necessarily that it's disengaged; it's that it's so rocky."
156,charm_city_kings,critics,fresh,p,"Even if the ending feels forced, the richly textured screenplay captures the moral dilemma of its adolescent protagonist while also effectively confronting the broader ethical questions surrounding a lifestyle it could have easily glorified."
157,charm_city_kings,critics,fresh,p,"Angel Manuel Soto is a director to keep an eye on. He's sharp, passionate, skilled and fearless."
158,charm_city_kings,critics,fresh,p,Soto and screenwriter Sherman Payne ... have crafted a convincing tale ... of a kid who isn't sure what wants -- but knows he wants it right now.
159,charm_city_kings,critics,fresh,p,"In its view of a world where kids make their own fun and also, sometimes, their own bad choices, it rings true."
160,charm_city_kings,audience,4.0,p,"Great acting, powerful story and great pace of story telling. So much better then I thought it would be."
161,charm_city_kings,audience,1.0,n,This movie does not take viewers into urban street bike culture as the title and previews would suggest. The first real glimpse into that world comes during the closing credits.
162,charm_city_kings,audience,3.5,p,Very well acted and engaging movie.
163,charm_city_kings,audience,3.0,p,The movie sadly falls in all the coming of age in the suburbs cliches without bringing anything really new or fresh to the tables. The characters are pretty as stereotypical as the setting and it is kind of a shame because the performances are effective and there's a great work done in the directing with very nice riding shots and a good sense of editing. Not special but enjoyable...sometimes it's enough depends on your mood.
164,charm_city_kings,audience,4.0,p,Great drama with a lot of meaning to it. It seems to unfortunatly have truth to it and happens to a lot of kids across the world. I think it gives perspective to kids who grow up not having to worry about money.
165,charm_city_kings,audience,1.0,n,"Come on critics. I know it is Netflix but come on. This movie is ok but nowhere near 60%. The story is lame, acting is ok but not great. Camera work is on a highschool level. Same movie with different actors would get 30%."
166,charm_city_kings,audience,4.5,p,"This movie was so good, really liked pretty much everything about it . It’s only once in awhile you get a great performance from kid actors . All three were perfect in this movie and even meek mill was awesome 4.3. I felt like meek was even a mentor to me just watching this . Hopefully there are a lot of people like him out there on the streets. I never realized Baltimore had an accent until this movie either . I really wanted mouse to listen the whole time so badly"
167,charm_city_kings,audience,3.5,p,Great story about redemption and righting wrongs!
168,charm_city_kings,audience,5.0,p,It was great! To understand you must understand the life
169,charm_city_kings,audience,2.0,n,This movie is based off of the wonderful documentary called 12 o'clock boys.  This movie sucks in comparison to the original.

172,the_courier,critics,rotten,n,"Despite having a rather committed performance from Benedict Cumberbatch, 'The Courier' is a spy thriller in the code of Le Carré that operates on conventional grounds without any tension or anything that is thrilling. [Full review in Spanish]"
173,the_courier,critics,fresh,p,The cast is very good but -- little surprise -- it's Cumberbatch who steals the show.

177,the_courier,critics,fresh,p,The second half surprises as the drama builds. [Full Review in Spanish]
178,the_courier,critics,fresh,p,"Following in the hallowed footsteps of le Carré, Dominic Cooke's The Courier is a smart, sophisticated Cold War espionage tale that proves facts can sometimes be more fantastical than fiction."
179,the_courier,critics,fresh,p,Turns out to be so much more than a history lesson... A daunting drama.
180,the_courier,critics,fresh,p,"The heart of the story doesn't come from Wynne's relationship with his wife, but from the bond he forges with Penkovsky."
181,the_courier,critics,fresh,p,"This is a riveting look behind the historical headlines, tracing a complex series of events with both clarity and nerves of steel."
182,the_courier,critics,fresh,p,"In this film, it's the rich character development, and the deep chemistry between the two leads, Ninidze and Cumberbatch, that does the heavy lifting."
183,the_courier,critics,fresh,p,"As Cold War thrillers go, this is top class - tense and stressful to an almost unbearable degree."
184,the_courier,critics,fresh,p,"Stylish, old-fashioned and enormously satisfying, like one of the old Daimlers you see purring around in the background of the film, catching the lights of 1960s Soho in its curves."
185,the_courier,critics,fresh,p,Combines plenty of the ingredients for a first-class espionage thriller but doesn't quite deliver.
186,the_courier,critics,fresh,p,Intriguing and genuinely heartfelt without ever veering into melodrama or hackneyed spy movie tropes.
187,the_courier,critics,fresh,p,"The Courier may have its moments, but it's also burdened with certain expectations."
188,the_courier,critics,fresh,p,"This is a damn good, explosively tense story that focuses on the friendship that develops between two men on opposite sides. And it is plainly wonderful."
189,the_courier,critics,rotten,n,"Unfortunately, The Courier is so slow and drab that there's plenty of time to play Cold War movie cliché bingo."
190,the_courier,audience,2.5,n,"A very mild telling of a personal drama losely tied to the Cuban Missile crisis. If you want to be entertained, watch a Bond movie."
191,the_courier,audience,4.0,p,Top notch thriller about an incredible chapter of the Cold War.
192,the_courier,audience,5.0,p,It has you on the edge of your seat with fear that he will be caught.  The fact that is a true story makes this a real winner.
193,the_courier,audience,3.0,p,"6.3/10 — ""Okay""/""Watchable""

-(Seen on 11/26/21)"
194,the_courier,audience,5.0,p,Very good historical thriller.
195,the_courier,audience,4.0,p,"There are countless movies dealing with the cold war and espionage between the United States and Russia. It is not a particularly original topic. But originality is not an essential requirement for a movie to be good or disastrous.

The Courier gives you the empathy necessary to enter the valley of feelings and emotions that the protagonists are showing. It keeps you on the edge of the seat, giving you the desire to know how everything will end (except if you already know how the real events happened). The script mixed with the good editing of the film create an accelerated and constant rhythm of scenes, giving the right tone and atmosphere to accentuate the most important moments.

The script is very well written, the acting is good, highlighting the role of Cumberbatch. The setting of the time in which the story takes place is very well done, both on set and digitally, including costumes and decorations.

My only weakness would be the lack of rawness in the adverse events in the last third of the film, which takes away a bit of realism, but at the same time, makes it a piece of film for almost all audiences.

In short, it exceeded expectations."
196,the_courier,audience,4.5,p,"A deceptively light spy-thriller approach to a tale that delivers an emotional wallop due in large part to the amazing Benedict Cumberbatch. 

Reminds us that for some, the Cold War wasn't so cold."
197,the_courier,audience,3.0,p,Nitel cam pe formula dar Benedict
198,the_courier,audience,4.5,p,Shot in B&W as to symbolize communism.  Real good spy movie set during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Excellent job by all.

201,the_last_thing_he_wanted,critics,rotten,n,"Despite an all-star cast of respectable and often captivating actors, The Last Thing He Wanted ultimately falls apart due to its convoluted storytelling and slavish devotion to its source material."
202,the_last_thing_he_wanted,critics,rotten,n,The sense of tension and the stakes remain high from frame to frame; it's just what connects them that's often absent.

212,the_last_thing_he_wanted,critics,rotten,n,Messy book-based political thriller has mature content.
213,the_last_thing_he_wanted,critics,fresh,p,"The Last Thing He Wanted might not be the thriller you're looking for, but stay for Anne Hathaway and Rosie Perez, at least."
214,the_last_thing_he_wanted,critics,rotten,n,"With its strong performances, pacing and imagery, The Last Thing He Wanted is one (fairly hefty) script revision away from theoretical year-best territory. Instead it missteps, with increasing frailty."
215,the_last_thing_he_wanted,critics,rotten,n,What's most frustrating about the film's incoherence is that there are still good sequences amid the chaos.
216,the_last_thing_he_wanted,critics,rotten,n,"Begins in a state of near-total incoherence and somehow meanders further from there, plunging into almost experimental territory with its choppily edited mess of ridiculous dialogue and hyper-dense plotting."
217,the_last_thing_he_wanted,critics,rotten,n,This film is both heavy on cryptic discourse while lacking any coherent order.
218,the_last_thing_he_wanted,critics,rotten,n,"Hathaway at times seems lost, unable to single-handedly conjure the suspicion and paranoia bubbling in the plot; Dafoe opts to chew scenery; Affleck is a non-entity."

What I don't get is, did anyone at Netflix actually see this film? Did any of the actors have read the screenplay. Boy, is this a boring, nothing makes sense film. Going to the dentist ist more exciting than this ""thriller"""
221,the_last_thing_he_wanted,audience,0.5,n,"A total waste of time, What was their thinking , if they did ?"
222,the_last_thing_he_wanted,audience,1.0,n,"Pointless film. No real point of view, no pressing story to tell, got more lost the longer in continued. There’s no takeaway message, no point to the film. And the storytelling is confusing and at times silly."
223,the_last_thing_he_wanted,audience,1.5,n,According to Netflix's ranking service it was #2 in the U.S. when I watched it.  I don't see why.  I really didn't think it was all that good.  I'm not a big fan of Anne Hathaway or Ben Affleck.  That might have colored my view of the film. They've always made questionable choices of films they are in and as their careers fade that only seems to be getting worse.
224,the_last_thing_he_wanted,audience,5.0,p,"In this neoVonnegut masterpiece, Hathaway's character's spirit, after spending 35 years in purgatory and under relatively heavy after-death antidepressant usage retells  this suspenseful thriller as best she can through idealism, memory, and emotions."

228,the_last_thing_he_wanted,audience,1.0,n,"Confusing. All over the place. Don't waste your time.

Why did they give Anne Hathaway's charachrer a Donald Trump orange tan?

1,beast_beast,critics,fresh,p,"The lives of three young people collide in Beast Beast, a patchwork-like, dramatic observation of the devastating effects of gun violence."
2,beast_beast,critics,fresh,p,"A dramatization of how crumbling families, malleable values, and identities propped up by digital validation can create an increasingly trigger-happy society."
3,beast_beast,critics,fresh,p,The well-acted coming-of-age drama overcomes its clumsy gun commentary.
4,beast_beast,critics,fresh,p,Takes the insecurities and anxieties of these young people and spins them into a vibrant and vivid portrait of growing up in this fragmented world.

8,beast_beast,critics,fresh,p,"For all the movie's soupiness, we're still left with a handful of memorable characters at a pivotal time in their emotional development, and for that, ""Beast Beast"" can boast a well-intentioned, caring integrity."
9,beast_beast,critics,rotten,n,It's in the push to explain a moral that it stumbles over its own good intentions.
10,beast_beast,critics,fresh,p,"If ""Beast Beast"" is grand at anything, it's in pulling truth out of these connected individuals, and in making all of us empathize honestly with them, no matter what they do. It's wonderfully magical in this way, without any trick attached."
11,beast_beast,critics,fresh,p,"While writer-director Madden's approach isn't particularly subtle, it definitely gets us thinking."
12,beast_beast,critics,fresh,p,"This drama starts out quietly, but it slowly simmers until it's at a full boil of angst and trauma related to issues affecting teens today..."
13,beast_beast,critics,fresh,p,Great acting and storytelling in one of the most authentic depictions of growing up.
14,beast_beast,critics,fresh,p,"Chen is extraordinary in a third act that strips Krista down to the bone, and it's easy to imagine how this entire movie would've fallen apart with a lesser actress to steer it home."
15,beast_beast,critics,rotten,n,"If you've lived long enough, or have seen enough movies, you can easily predict every single thing that takes place here, including its jarring tonal swing."
16,beast_beast,critics,fresh,p,Danny Madden has delivered a strong indictment of the teenage experience in a film that should only grow esteem with age.
17,beast_beast,critics,fresh,p,The main and secondary actors' naturalness... is essential. [Full review in Spanish]
18,beast_beast,critics,fresh,p,"Based on his own short film called Krista, it feels like Madden searched for a full-length plot to piece around the original short and it blurred the message along the way."
19,beast_beast,critics,rotten,n,The way in which gun violence is used to propel the story and characters forward among all of this feels far too abrupt that the story and characters feel short changed in the end.

21,beast_beast,audience,5.0,p,"My friend took me to see this at a theater in N.Hollywood. Wow. Such a fresh filmmaking voice. This film is dynamic, it's paced like teenage life and each of the three storylines feels unique. Some blemishes, but I can accept that as low-budget charm and would rather see that than some predictable, sterile storytelling. For a first time filmmaker this shows real promise. I LOVE Shirley Chen in the main role. Also Jose Angeles and Will Madden give grounded, emotional performances, and the sound design is something special (watch it with good headphones/nice speakers). This film hit me hard; that's the only way I can explain it. Big thumbs up!"
22,beast_beast,audience,5.0,p,"Sometimes I get exhausted with indy flicks, but this one was really well crafted and sincere. Would watch again"
23,beast_beast,audience,5.0,p,"A battle of three truths, where no one and everyone is to blame for the tragedies that ensue. Funny, relatable, complicated, jarring, and cautionary, this film earns 5-stars all-around. Refreshingly realistic performances by the leading actors, dazzling direction by Danny Madden, and an anxiously exhilarating soundtrack (that's more of a heartbeat than a score), make this film an instant Gen Z classic. A must see for the roaring 20s, and any film viewer looking for the real deal."
24,blast_beat,critics,fresh,p,"The sibling rivalry dynamic carries this film along with a unique element not normally associated with a Latino story, metal music. A reminder that Latinos aren't a monolith and the every immigrant story is unique."
25,blast_beat,critics,fresh,p,It's grounded in sincere emotion and very thoughtful in its exploration of the American Dream.
26,blast_beat,critics,fresh,p,"The movie has some flaws (including an ending that's just a little too rushed), but Blast Beat overall will make a memorable impression on viewers of this unique immigrant family story."
27,blast_beat,critics,rotten,n,"... establishes some intriguing character dynamics, yet as a broader examination of the immigrant experience, it lacks the depth and nuance to make an impact."
28,blast_beat,critics,fresh,p,"Cluttered with too many ideas, this drama still gets credit for its three-dimensional portrayal of the immigrant experience in America and its love-hate portrait of brothers."
29,blast_beat,critics,fresh,p,"The filmmaker nails the ups and downs of a sibling relationship - largely thanks to the two charismatic leads, whose bond feels authentic."
30,blast_beat,critics,fresh,p,"All in all, Blast Beat has much appeal, especially for young audiences and those who share the American Dream. But does it work for everyone?"
31,blast_beat,critics,rotten,n,"""In trying to force a plot and purpose upon this ordinary story, the filmmakers end up drifting away from the movie's stronger elements."
32,blast_beat,critics,fresh,p,"""Blast Beat"" is a showcase for the Arias brothers. ... Together, they look like opposites, ... but their brotherly bond shines through whether the Restrepo siblings are fighting or helping each other out."
33,blast_beat,critics,fresh,p,Blast Beat is both riveting and elegant in its portrayal of the American dream.
34,blast_beat,critics,fresh,p,"""Blast Beat"": a drama that sharply inspects the concept of the American Dream and those who either pursue it or reject it altogether."
35,blast_beat,critics,rotten,n,"Too bad the film opts for classic Hollywood closure rather than following through on the promise of its painful, shifting origins."
36,blast_beat,critics,rotten,n,"The film wants to talk about so many topics, and yet it ends up shortchanging all of them so that it can make for one massive emotional scene after the next."
37,blast_beat,critics,rotten,n,"It fails to progress towards the maturation that it requires. Simply put, Blast Beat unfortunately fails to find the right beat."
38,blast_beat,critics,fresh,p,"""Blast Beat"" powers through its clichés by cranking up a soundtrack of Synapticide and the Eastside Boyz."
39,blast_beat,critics,rotten,n,"There's plenty of potential here to bring original insights to the immigrant experience, but not enough skill in the plotting or execution to tap into it."
40,blast_beat,critics,fresh,p,"A terrific bilingual debut that keenly scrutinizes the American Dream, those who pursue it vehemently, and the ones who reject it as the sole avenue to fulfillment."
41,blast_beat,audience,4.0,p,"A fun ride. Characters didn't feel like movie characters I've seen in countless other films, it felt fresh."
42,the_mole_agent,critics,fresh,p,"Funny, heartwarming and sometimes heartbreaking, we follow our spy as he struggles with the tech he needs to use for his mission and as he finds immerses himself in the lives of the various characters in the nursing home in this touching, insightful film."
43,the_mole_agent,critics,fresh,p,Alberdi's eye is perceptive and poignant.
44,the_mole_agent,critics,fresh,p,"Chilean director Maite Alberdi's elderly spy documentary is so compelling, audiences will wonder if it's really a documentary or a scripted film pretending to be a documentary."
45,the_mole_agent,critics,fresh,p,"Director Maite Alberdi's creative, captivating new film The Mole Agent feels like a rather slow narrative feature, in which not enough happens, until you remember it's a documentary."
46,the_mole_agent,critics,fresh,p,Chilean director Maite Alberdi's genre-bending The Mole Agent is a portrait of advanced age unlike any I've seen. The filmmaker deftly mixes documentary with spy thriller.
47,the_mole_agent,critics,fresh,p,There's no question that it tells a memorable story with a meaningful message...
48,the_mole_agent,critics,fresh,p,A very particular and ingenious mix of reality and invention. [Full review in Spanish]
49,the_mole_agent,critics,fresh,p,"Initially staged as a grand mystery, 'The Mole Agent' eventually is a mere reminder to visit any friends or relatives you might know who are in care facilities."
50,the_mole_agent,critics,fresh,p,"Terrific, thought-provoking entertainment."
51,the_mole_agent,critics,fresh,p,"The premise of the movie is so bizarre we can hardly believe it's not staged, even though most of the characters could never be imagined as actors."
52,the_mole_agent,critics,fresh,p,"Alberdi sees the change he brings to people who haven't been paid this much attention in years, and also the change the spy gig brings in Sergio - and sharing her affectionate gaze is easy in this thoughtful film."
53,the_mole_agent,critics,fresh,p,"The Mole Agent, an intriguing fly-on-the-wall documentary from Chile, takes an unusual approach to the subject of the treatment of the elderly."
54,the_mole_agent,critics,fresh,p,"The Mole Agent is simultaneously both a very soft and very hard film to watch retrospectively in the context of the coronavirus, but it is always humane."
55,the_mole_agent,critics,fresh,p,"Unforced and without any formal narration, director Maite Alberdi fashions a gentle, moving, insightful portrait of people who, for some, appear to have lived too long."
56,the_mole_agent,critics,rotten,n,"The Mole Agent is borderline insulting in its approach, and not nearly as clever as it thinks it is."
57,the_mole_agent,critics,fresh,p,Maite Alberdi shows us a reality from a point of view that could not be more human. [Full Review in Spanish]
58,the_mole_agent,critics,fresh,p,"I don't really care what we call it, as long as we acknowledge that it's charming and good."
59,the_mole_agent,critics,fresh,p,"The Mole Agent offers an entertaining and emotionally moving portrait of humanity in a Chilean retirement home. However, the 'spy' aspect of the story seems as contrived and cutesy as some of the documentary's scenes."
60,the_mole_agent,critics,fresh,p,Alberdi's film makes a subtle case for bringing that level of compassion and dignity back into the eldercare debate...
61,the_mole_agent,critics,fresh,p,What starts as a detective mission quickly turns into a heartfelt treatise on the ways in which our elderly has been systematically forgotten by their children instead.
62,the_mole_agent,audience,4.5,p,"Absolutely loved it. Maybe a bit staged at times. But laughed hard at times, and felt challenged by the end of it. Great Documentary."
63,the_mole_agent,audience,4.0,p,"🇨🇱 El documental chileno nominado a los Oscars de 2021 en el que un detective privado contrata a Don Sergio de 83 años para que viva tres meses como agente encubierto en un hogar para adultos mayores, debido a denuncias de maltrato. Ya infiltrado, le cuesta asumir su rol de topo y se transforma en uno más al interior de la casa de reposo. Un documental inusual pero enternecedor y compasivo que nos recuerda la terrible soledad que deben soportar los adultos mayores cuando sus familiares se olvidan de ellos tan pronto son internados. Llena de momentos divertidos y momentos algo tristes, se puede definir con una palabra: humana."
64,the_mole_agent,audience,4.0,p,"Fácil, directo, bien hecho, una pequeña triquiñuela para recordar una gran verdad. Algunos ya pasamos por ahí, algunos podemos ver nuestros errores ahí, algunos ""sentimos"" por lo que se muestra ahí, algunos experimentamos mucha melancolía..."
65,the_mole_agent,audience,4.0,p,What started off seeming as just a funny spy documentary became much more deeper and emotional by the end.
66,the_mole_agent,audience,4.0,p,Good-hearted and charming with a powerful message and reminder of true love and familial duty
67,the_mole_agent,audience,0.5,n,"For a documentary, it's staged and it doesn't show the actual reality. It's acted and staged, clearly not reflecting what actually happens on the elder houses"
68,the_mole_agent,audience,3.0,p,"This Oscar nominated documentary has an 83-year old man going ""undercover"" at a nursing home... though that aspect gets dropped fairly early on and it becomes a rather touching look at life inside the home."
69,the_mole_agent,audience,5.0,p,"Not at all what I expected. heartwarming, heartbreaking, and wholly relatable if you have older family members. and we all do or will."
70,the_mole_agent,audience,3.0,p,"When the daughter of a nursing home patient suspects that her mother is being subjected to elder abuse and theft of her possessions, she hires an investigator to verify the claims through surveillance conducted by an elderly ""spy"" he recruits to check in as a temporary resident. What the mole finds, however, doesn't exactly jibe with the accusations but, instead, reveals a very different truth about what it's like to be a resident of one of these facilities. Despite this, though, director Maite Alberdi's latest documentary offering struggles with telling its story, leading viewers to believe it's headed in one direction while actually moving in another less-than-apparent manner, one that's not well delineated until the film's closing moments. What's more, it's not always clear just how much of a ""documentary"" this release really is, given a premise that seems to be more than a little ""planned"" in nature. Also, its attempts at humor, though cute at first, fade as the picture progresses and reveals a more substantive, serious narrative, one that makes its comedic material look cheeky as a consequence. There indeed is an important message here, but its presentation deserved better treatment in the finished product."
71,the_mole_agent,audience,5.0,p,"Fantastic Movie, so touching!"
72,falling_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Mortensen, in his first effort behind the camera, proves to be an unflashy director, and that's fine for his simple goals."
73,falling_2020,critics,fresh,p,"If not for the commendable acting from the stars of the movie, Falling would be a very unpleasant chore to watch."
74,falling_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Viggo Mortensen's directorial debut nonetheless proves to be a powerful, beautifully shot and incredibly performed honest portrayal of dementia."
75,falling_2020,critics,rotten,n,"Falling for Mortensen's work as an actor is one thing, but his directorial debut is a lot harder to fall for."
76,falling_2020,critics,rotten,n,"Has a certain base competence to it, but the takeaway is ambiguous as it reaches for a lyricism that never coalesces."
77,falling_2020,critics,rotten,n,"Based on a largely superficial grasp of American social life, the stock in trade of Hollywood liberalism, Mortensen's film is neither terribly convincing nor terribly perceptive."
78,falling_2020,critics,rotten,n,Falling fails to justify why the audience should care about and uncomfortably endure this draining melodrama of a wretched mean-spirited human being and his enabling codependent accomplice.
79,falling_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The strength, patience and universal need to forgive and bridge generational gaps Mr. Mortensen is aiming for have a devastating effect."
80,falling_2020,critics,rotten,n,"It's a bold approach, but too often ""Falling"" comes off just as incorrigible as its lead character."
81,falling_2020,critics,rotten,n,"Trying to generate sympathy for its characters, Mortensen's screenplay winds up wallowing in their misery."
82,falling_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Lance Henriksen gives one of the great ""rage, rage against the dying of the light"" performances"
83,falling_2020,critics,rotten,n,"Some successful, but mostly not..."
84,falling_2020,critics,fresh,p,It's beautifully done and intense with some very dramatic scenes.
85,falling_2020,critics,rotten,n,"Ultimately, this grueling, overlong picture - think a chamber piece but with multiple characters and locations - never zeroes in on what it wants us to think or feel about Willis or John. But if it's sympathy, it doesn't get there."
86,falling_2020,critics,fresh,p,"To add shading, Mortensen includes scenes -- moments, really -- in which Willis shows genuine affection for his son...providing much-needed nuance about the complexity of a bullying relationship."
87,falling_2020,critics,fresh,p,"There's a lot of realism in this, and that's what makes it work."
88,falling_2020,critics,rotten,n,"You have to give Mortensen credit though for his uncompromising viewpoint. Still, ""Falling"" is an agonizing watch."
89,falling_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Mortensen draws on his experience as a committed, collaborative actor of intense emotional truth and deep research for his powerhouse late-career directing debut. The result is a visceral and urgent drama."
90,falling_2020,critics,fresh,p,"First-time feature director Viggo Mortensen auspiciously writes, composes, produces and copes with fab co-star Lance Henricksen, as a combustible father spitting out deep-rooted prejudices now without mental filters being slowly disabled by dementia."
91,falling_2020,critics,fresh,p,Falling is engrossing as a drama while equally vile and revolting in Henriksen's career-topping supporting turn.
92,falling_2020,audience,3.0,p,"A remake of ""The Father"" influenced by a sequel to ""Green Book"": is the non-linear structure due to the point of view of paternal dementia or the confusion in the childhood memories of Viggo on his directorial debut? He has forced the character of the couple of protagonists to the point of a caricatural parody of the polarized political, ideological and moral souls of the contemporary United States: an intermediate agonic phase between two mutual inability to take care of a dying person, at the beginning and at the end of the film. 
(Mauro Lanari)"
93,falling_2020,audience,1.0,n,"C'est l'ennui qui prédomine dans ce drame sans réelle situation dramatique, ou en tout cas, sans que les situations dramatiques ne soient assumées jusqu'au bout et exploitées en tant que telle. On a l'impression d'assister à une suite de scènes inintéressantes, se contentant sans nuance de montrer toujours les mêmes défauts d'un père qui semble tous les accumuler (machisme, homophobie, racisme etc). Même le travail sur la lumière est raté. Et on ne voit pas non plus l'utilité des deux narrations mise en parallèle."
94,falling_2020,audience,4.0,p,"This movie really frightened me because my father was just like his, he had to be cruel and knew just what to say to punch my buttons.  Also his father is a very good actor, and his son too and the sons daughter, I rate this movie very highly!!!!"
95,falling_2020,audience,5.0,p,Finally a great dramatic film. The role of the father was relentless.
96,falling_2020,audience,0.5,n,Pointlessly traumatising and hard to watch. Viggo's performance as a gay man is limited to effeminate gestures and nothing else. The movie should come with a trigger warning for strong anti gay slur used almost like a badge of honor and no apparent reason.
97,falling_2020,audience,4.0,p,"This one's brutally honest as to what many go through while caring for aging loved ones. All the actors did a superb job but some stood out more than others. I was extremely impressed by Lance Henriksen's outstanding oscar worthy performance, he's superb.  Sverrir Gudnason was also a presence to be reckoned with. awesome performance. Laura, Terry & the rest of the cast also very impressive. Last but not least  Viggo Mortensen wore many hats as writer, actor, director & more to combine all these wonderful actors into a heartfelt movie that we can all relate with in some way.  His scene with Lance as the son eventually loses his cool really stood out to me, excellent performance. 
The line ""I'm not afraid of grandpa"" will forever be imprinted in my mind. This movie's a must see, especially for so many that feel they're alone in taking care of loved ones with dementia."
98,falling_2020,audience,3.5,p,"Viggo Mortensen dons multiple hats including directing, writing and scoring for his debut feature, a fictional piece that's obviously intensely personal to him. As a film, it may look like your very typically indie about a father and son relationship, but it is an engaging, intriguing and lyrically composed one, despite some frantic intercutting between the present day, where 70-year-old Willis, played by Lance Henriksen, is struggling with old age and dementia, and flashbacks that fill in the blanks on how his family dynamics developed through the years with Sverrir Gudnason as the younger Willis (an inspired bit of casting as he looks like both a younger Henriksen and a younger Mortensen who plays his son John). Willis is a flawed man drowning in regrets who takes his frustration and anger out on his family, lashing out indiscriminately at all those around him, using language that's both vile and provocative. Yet in spite of all that, Henriksen's unfiltered central performance, perhaps his career-best, remains sympathetic. Ably supported by a cast that includes the always reliable Laura Linney and a controlled performance by Mortensen as a son who has the patience of a saint and remains calm and collected despite the abuse that's thrown at him, the film seeks to see beyond Willis' crusty and awful exterior. As a family drama, it is empathetic and quietly assured in its exploration of how communication and love can bring two people that have a chasm of differences between them together; and I did find myself rather moved and captured by this beautifully crafted character study of a film, even though it wobbles into arty fuzziness in the final sequence of scenes when it becomes unsure as to where and how to wrap things up."
99,falling_2020,audience,4.0,p,"Falling is an amazing collage of one man's life and how he's impacted upon and continues to affect the lives of those closest to him, even as he draws closer to his end. This raw, realistic and artfully crafted movie draws your nerves and emotions in every conceivable direction with an almost nauseating effect as you can feel yourself in every woeful situation the characters face.
Great film and thoroughly rewatchable."
100,falling_2020,audience,3.5,p,"Viggo Mortensen the actor is great, but Viggo Mortensen the director not so much. His first directorial feature, Falling, well, falls into the repetitious cycle of insults and confrontations throughout most of the runtime with the third act being disappointing. Still, the complicated and deeply troubled father-son relationship at the heart of it is well realized, its heart is clearly in the right place, and the performance from Lance Henriksen is truly fantastic as he inhabits this truly awful, hateful and irredeemable human being impressively effortlessly."
101,falling_2020,audience,3.5,p,A tough one to watch. The acting from Lance Henriksen is pretty exceptional. It almost makes me wonder if he has dementia because he works it perfectly.
102,into_the_deep_2020,critics,fresh,p,"A great documentary that is incredibly difficult to watch. The story is incredible to begin with, the fact a documentary was filmed during the events is unbelievable."
103,into_the_deep_2020,critics,fresh,p,"A documentary that is truly hard to shake, it provides an intimate glimpse at true evil living amongst those who only saw the warning signs and red flags after the fact."
104,into_the_deep_2020,critics,fresh,p,"I left Into the Deep in a daze, not knowing how to apply its lessons to everyday life. I suppose that if I ever meet someone who makes multiple jokes about beheading people, I'm getting the hell out of there."
105,into_the_deep_2020,critics,fresh,p,A knockout doc.
106,into_the_deep_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Restrained, humanist and chilling, ""Into the Deep"" is both a portrait of evil and a story of the workers left ashore floundering to understand how they devoted their lives to a fiend."
107,into_the_deep_2020,critics,fresh,p,A remarkable piece of cinema just in its very existence.
108,into_the_deep_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Into the Deep is a unique beast in a documentary landscape that's more consumed than ever with the true-crime genre, and it is a must-watch for anyone even slightly curious about the events of this bizarre and tragic crime."
109,into_the_deep_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The kind of film that, through the dark fortune of timing, starts off as one thing and then proceeds to become something far more important and disturbing, effectively interrogating itself."
110,into_the_deep_2020,critics,fresh,p,Emma Sullivan has a major accomplishment under her belt with Into The Deep.
111,downhill_2020,critics,fresh,p,"People who have seen the original film will appreciate that film more than the remake... for me, I enjoyed it."
112,downhill_2020,critics,rotten,n,"Overall, the writing team maintains some effective elements from their top-notch source but never fully meld mildly funny moments with the truly thorny issue that jumpstarts the story."
113,downhill_2020,critics,rotten,n,"[The film] isn't funny enough to be a comedy, but lacks any necessary depth to truly resonate with audiences or engender investment in the outcome."
114,downhill_2020,critics,rotten,n,There's hardly anything redemptive of Downhill and none of it is enough for me to claim any love for the film... We can make room for other stories.
115,downhill_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Ferrell and Louis-Dreyfus are as good together as you'd expect, and we'd love to see them pair in something again soon, be it more serious or far less so."
116,downhill_2020,critics,rotten,n,"""The remake turns a serious magical movie into a shallow one."
117,downhill_2020,critics,rotten,n,"At first, glance seeing the pairing of Dreyfus and Ferrell seems promising; however, the opportunity for cinematic hilarity was wasted."
118,downhill_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Downhill puts two titans of comedy into some supremely difficult situations, and the process of seeing them go through them is more rewarding than a straight-up comedy would have been."
119,downhill_2020,critics,rotten,n,"By the end, it feels like maybe it would have been more fun to have jumped off the edge of a mountain than have watched this couple fight on one."
120,downhill_2020,critics,fresh,p,"It's a bitter little pill, but it worked for me. Proceed with caution and you will be rewarded with an insightful drama."
121,downhill_2020,critics,rotten,n,I realise why you take great foreign language movies and remake them for English speaking audiences but I'm not sure there's a single element of Downhill that is the equal of the original film.
122,downhill_2020,critics,rotten,n,"Force Majeure literally means ""superior force"" in French, so maybe they had no hope, but there's also something ugly about this latest in a long line of US studios breaking foreign films an attempt at remaking them."
123,downhill_2020,critics,fresh,p,"""Downhill"" retains the essential DNA of ""Force Majeure,"" and therefore remains a strange and prickly piece of work."
124,downhill_2020,critics,rotten,n,'Downhill' is a perfect word to describe the steep slide into disappointment that your expectations will take when you think about how this movie wastes the talents of Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell.
125,downhill_2020,critics,fresh,p,"If you're looking for something a little more than a pretty good comedy/drama, you might come away slightly disappointed."
126,downhill_2020,critics,rotten,n,You'd be better off seeking out the more effective original than settling for a pale facsimile.
127,downhill_2020,critics,fresh,p,"...it accomplishes what it sets out to, but overall the film seems out of balance. For every moment that is genuinely hilarious and great, there is another that drags on or doesn't quite land."
128,downhill_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The story still works, with the bigger revelations and solutions packing a punch, though it's a shame that it's not original."
129,downhill_2020,critics,rotten,n,Downhill lives up to its title. [Full review in Spanish]
130,downhill_2020,critics,rotten,n,Takes a troubling and uncomfortable study of human relationships and turns it into mildly entertaining sitcom.
131,downhill_2020,audience,1.5,n,Supposedly a dark comedy about a marriage falling apart.  It wasn't funny.  It is mostly depressing and makes you want to slap some sense into all the characters.
132,downhill_2020,audience,0.5,n,"Pretty awful throughout, not much more I can say"
133,downhill_2020,audience,2.0,n,"I didn't enjoy this one, but it is at least half my own fault because I didn't prepare properly. It was labeled a comedy-drama, but I had assumed with two pure comedians as the leads that there would be a lot more laughs than there ended up being. It was like I showed up for a birthday party with a kazoo and never got an opportunity to blow that thing because the birthday kid's parents were arguing the entire time. The premise is very good & I do like the idea of subverting expectations by setting up a comedy and then ruining it with an unexpected event, but something about the choice of leads (particularly Ferrell) had me missing the boat on this one."
134,downhill_2020,audience,3.0,p,"I didn't didn't see the original film, and maybe that was a good thing? So I had nothing to compare it to. It seemed strange to me that it was set it in Europe (I didn't quite get that) or why Will's co-worker/friend was there too. Maybe I missed something. 

I like all four actors - I knew three of them and love Julia and Will. That being said, I didn't think this was a comedy at all. And I know the main three for their comedy mostly. I really liked Julia in this. I could relate to her character though. I thought her acting was excellent. 

I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone to watch, because I don't think it was good enough. I remember watching them give interviews when it came out originally, and I thought it would be much better than it was. It just fell flat. 

Honestly, I just like Julia and can relate to her character - so I sat through it. The three female characters were great. Very well acted."
135,downhill_2020,audience,2.0,n,The movie couldn't decide if it was a drama or a comedy...it failed at both.

163,the_assistant_2020,audience,2.5,n,"So. Very. Slow.

Julia Garner is a talented actress, but I don't know if this script this movie really even called for one.  
Not all movies need to adhere to the standard story arc formula - meet protagonist, rising action, climax, falling action, closure.  Plenty of movies adhere to a different, albeit somewhat formulaic, storyboard.  But this movie had NO rising or falling.  It was essentially a flatline throughout, with even the characters themselves appearing to be half-awake/half-dead through the majority of the film.
I won't give a synopsis, but it's a relatively candid slice of life movie.  A couple of weeks in the life of an assistant.  Not a compelling premise, but with such high reviews I assumed it was thusly MADE in a compelling fashion.  Not so.  The movie may as well have been about the day in the life of a New York City pigeon, or street sweeper.  
Anyway, only if you have the absolutely longest stretch of time you need to fill, would I consider recommending this movie.  But even then, you're better off simply rewatching a good movie."
164,the_assistant_2020,audience,4.0,p,"Not since Tom Hardy in Locke have I seen a standalone performance more effective at inducing anxiety using small, everyday environments than that of Julia Garner in The Assistant. 

What could have been a token response to the bevy of sexual assault allegations in the entertainment industry over preceding years, and the upswell of female empowerment in film as a response, instead becomes a dark portrayal not only of the inadequacy of current methods to disincentivize abusive behavior in the workplace but also the dread of the bottom-rung employee. Being neither a woman nor Green does an excellent job of conveying that distinct combination of the fresh hire - simultaneously faceless but first on the call list when something goes unexpectedly wrong, going about your day with the fear that any one of your necessary-but-dull tasks could unravel into a place in the unemployment line. 

Tight, empathetic, and chillingly plausible, The Assistant is far more than what some may judge it as based on the cover alone (a Weinstein retort), but is instead a top-shelf workplace drama with good camerawork, a great lead performance, and well-designed characters that toe the moral line in their willingness to look the other way. (4/5)"
165,the_assistant_2020,audience,1.0,n,"Horrible. Don't trust ""TOMATOMETER"". A silent film would be more interesting with more of a plot."

167,the_assistant_2020,audience,3.0,p,"The story and the realism behind it is truly impactful. Garner puts forth another truly fantastic performance as well. However, the movie seemingly drags on and it doesn't progress throughout the duration like you would expect. It falls into a problematic cycle of focusing just on the message and not the product of the movie. The movie will hardly keep the majority interested for its entirety."

169,the_assistant_2020,audience,4.5,p,"Summary: Fresh out of college, Jane accepts an entry-level position for a god-awful film producer. Throughout the course of a single work day, her every move is scrutinized. 

Takeaways: The main character, a frail and duteous worker, is a symbol for women in the workplace. The manipulative, power-hungry boss shames and belittles her just because the system allows him to. During the film, your skin will crawl. After the film, you will have a precise example for what work culture shouldn't be."
170,the_assistant_2020,audience,4.0,p,"""The Assistant"" is basically a horror movie about a woman working in a production company, and even though so much people hated this film for being VERY slow paced, i think it gives an idea of how boring and depressing working in a company is. Also it shows how everyone ""shits"" at her and no one gives a shit about the thing she do. When she does something wrong they get mad while sitting on a luxurious couch  buying new gucci clothes. This shows the bad side of capitalism and thats why it didnt get any awards oscar type. It's too real."

20,relic,audience,4.0,p,"Relic uses what seems to be a demonic possession, and the imagery of mold, to talk about dementia and how it affects the family. It's a very sensible subject that can make the movie hard to watch but despite the promise that can sound exploitative it's a very intelligent movie that use slow burns, emotional stakes and creative visuals to share its message. The acting is also a strong point here, the three actresses playing the grand-mother, the mother and the daughter succeed in the intense challenge that asks this movie.

As a horror movie, it works very well despite few scary moments, the atmosphere is oppressive and the climax is worth the slow building."

26,relic,audience,5.0,p,"Scary, unique, and for people who can relate (maybe also those who cant) emotionally devastating"
27,relic,audience,4.0,p,"8/10. While it seems content working within the pre-established boundaries of modern horror, ‘Relic' is a showcase for generating increasingly agonizing spookiness while also working as a sympathetic metaphor for the difficulties of senility for both the aging and their loved ones alike. You can't ask much more from debuting director and writer Natalie Erika James, a talent who already displays full command of her craft. James' mastery of her skill-set is best represented in her exercise of restraint. She uses just enough gore to disturb without disgusting, enough slow-burn to chill without boring, and enough heart in her story crafting to earn its final payoff without feeling cheap or tonally disjunct. It's a delicate balancing act, but James pulls it off to satisfyingly scary effect. Her next step will be defining a distinct voice and style – while this movie was incredibly well done, I didn't see anything that felt like a signature, or that might suggest a new trajectory or offshoot for which this new golden age of horror might be made to account. It certainly stands shoulder to shoulder with much of the great horror films we've seen this past decade, but it doesn't do much to stand out. I might disagree with myself whenever we get to see her follow up, as it sometimes takes a few works before seeing what makes a person's art truly *theirs*. In the end, ‘Relic' is a fine, fully effective horror flick that has something poignant to say, and suggests great things to come from it's creator."
28,relic,audience,5.0,p,"Unsettling as it may be, Relic should be required viewing for everyone (if I had my way). However, as it is not a by-the-numbers haunted house story, I would widdle down that demand to those interested in literature, or at the very least, those looking to dig a little deeper into the films they watch. At the forefront of my praise is the expertly presented sound design. The crispiness of each creak, crack, and crunch is so visceral, it's like a multi-course meal for your ears, though maybe not an appetizing one. While visuals do obviously add necessary quality to film, your mind's understanding of what it is seeing can't be fully realized without the sound to accompany it; the filmmakers were apparently well aware of that. The sounds of water running, tea kettles whistling, floor boards creaking, leaves rustling--every one of them seems uncomfortably elevated and primed to send a shiver down your spine. With little to no accompanying score in many scenes, we are left with the emptiness of the air in any given setting and either the sounds in it, or with the dialogue between our three leads. Emily Mortimer is always a pleasant presence on screen, and it is comforting to see that she has found herself in better roles and projects than her ridiculously two-dimensional character in 2000's Scream 3. Bella Heathcote plays a wonderful granddaughter character who is willing to uproot her life to move in with her grandmother and disagrees with her own mother on the course of action that should be taken to care for her. And Robyn Nevin's earnest, fearful portrayal of the aforementioned grandmother suffering from dementia is both sympathetic and frightening. These women bring a realness to the family dynamic affected by this debilitating illness that in and of itself would be difficult to watch, but coupled with the horror element intentionally brought to the forefront of our eyes, it becomes truly unnerving. I would also like to give praise to the filmmakers for including a young actor with Down Syndrome in the film, as I love that Hollywood is embracing these actors and finding great roles for them to play in film and television (looking at you, Ryan Murphy). As for the visuals, Charlie Sarroff, the cinematographer, has painted each scene in a myriad of washed out colors with a damp, moldiness consistently plaguing each wall, window and other fixtures, either physically or metaphorically. The tone of confusion is established from the first scene, and you never stop wondering what you are seeing, especially when it comes to the final act. Natalie Erika James has truly created some cinematic literature here, ripe for film school discussions. The true, haunting quality of Relic is in its dual message of both what it must feel like to watch a loved one slip away as a result of advancing Alzheimer's/Dementia, and what the world around you must look like as you, the afflicted, tumble closer and closer to an unwilling abandonment of memory."
29,relic,audience,0.5,n,"Stunningly slow, tedious, and hardly scary. From the half-way point through to the end, I was very tempted to give it up and turn it off... but no, I kept giving it a chance to redeem itself. It never did. Time is precious; I hate throwing even 90 minutes away on drivel like this. I happened to catch the 2012 film *Sinister* with Ethan Hawke one night last week. Now that was a scary film!"

The fact that Kim Jong-Un is that paranoid about his brother somehow taking over the dictatorship is insane and he would kill his own bloodline just to make sure it never happened. I feel bad for the two naive girls who got tricked into committing the assassination, but they honestly Japanese shows do crazy pranks like that so I could see how they could get duped. However why wouldn't they question the so called directors when they commanded the two girls to make sure that they rubbed the liquid down their face into the men's eyes? That right there is considered assault and anybody with common sense should question that. I also wonder if Malaysia and other Asian airports have better cameras and more airport security. That was pretty pathetic how easy the assination was. And I hope they have signs all around the airports warning that ""TV pranks"" are prohibited and illegal so naive girls trying to make money are not duped again."
52,assassins_2020,audience,4.0,p,"One of the better documentaries I've seen. It contains a lot of good information about the case and also tells the story from the perspective of the two women. The footage, pacing, and interviews were well done, although a few more people linked to the case should have been shown on screen since it was mostly limited to the lawyers, two journalists, and the two women. I initially didn't think they would be stupid enough to believe that they were doing a prank show, but the documentary revealed the manipulation from the North Koreans and the build up of pranks months in advance. I felt sorry for the women by the end and was satisfied with the take-away message."
53,assassins_2020,audience,5.0,p,"A brilliant documentary feature from Ryan White exploring the assassination of the Older half brother of the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.  It's an Un-believable story of two women who kill with a very adept team.  It's Un-real.  It's my favorite doc of 2020.  It's told in a non linear way and it works.  Even of you know a little of this story, the detail White is able to give makes it fly and it's totally worth the watch.  It's a True Crime story come to life!  Final Score: 10/10"
54,assassins_2020,audience,5.0,p,"Unfolding the assassination of Kim Jong-nam at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in 2017, this is an exhilaratingly immersing documentary that unnervingly suggests our mortal means of subsistence in a foreign land could be a merciless exploitation in an absolute execution by the North Korea's Kim Dynasty and become objects of sacrifice in maintaining political relations between countries."

57,assassins_2020,audience,4.0,p,"North Korea's Scariest Home Videos -  Film Review: Assassins ★★★★

Anyone who knows me well has heard of my utter obsession with all things North Korea.  Late at night, I can be found diving deep into Korea-Holes on the internet, reading interviews with defectors, clicking on smuggled-out videos of public executions, or watching documentaries about the Hermit Kingdom. My heart goes out to the population made up essentially of 25 million prisoners in their own country. The reports of human rights abuses remain consistent with the tenure of its current ""Dear Leader"", Kim Jong-un.  The horrors occurring outside of the state-sanctioned tourist routes paint a picture of a ruthless dictator who will stop at nothing to maintain complete control of his citizens. Even his own family members aren't safe. Witness the killing of his uncle as one example. 

It's with another murder, of Kim Jong-nam, the leader's half-brother, that acclaimed documentary filmmaker, Ryan White (Good Ol' Freda, The Keepers, The Case Against 8) trained his camera on one of the most jaw-dropping and diabolical public assassinations of modern times. Naturally, I inhaled this film, Assassins, the moment I got my grubby hands on it. 

Kim Jong-nam, the oldest child of Kim-Jong-il and thus, the heir apparent to the Kim Dynasty, had been living in exile since 2003. His ousting came as a result of attempting to visit Disneyland Tokyo with his children, although he would later say it was based more on his criticism of the regime.  Either way, in 2017, Kim Jong-nam had a highly toxic chemical agent applied to his face in the Malaysia International Airport's departure hall, which was caught on security camera footage. This brazen act led to his death within an hour. 

Shortly thereafter, police arrested two women, strangers to each other, for the assassination. Siti and Doan, Indonesian and Vietnamese immigrants respectively, admitted to being hired to commit the act, but they thought they had participated in a prank video. The two women, financially struggling, had been filming pranks for some time before this fateful day. They claimed they had no idea they had been asked to approach such a high profile target. They thought the chemical agent was a hand lotion they had used in  prior videos. With a trial and the death penalty on the line, I won't spoil what happens next, but suffice it to say, it's evil stuff.  

Similar to what happened with Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist murdered at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul in 2018, Kim Jong-nam's assassination orders appeared to come from the highest levels of government. Additionally, in both cases, the current U.S. President turned a blind eye, even going so far as to later cozy up to Kim Jong-un and declare they were ""in love"". 

Lost in the shuffle with their lives hanging in the balance, Siti and Doan remain the primary focus of this hugely empathetic film. White exposes the vulnerability of women who move to countries like Malaysia to make a better life for themselves. Both young and vibrant with career aspirations, the pair fell victim to a nefarious group of men who had groomed them for some time. Prosecutors maintained that the women knew exactly what they were doing. White uses a mixture of existing footage, interviews with journalists and lawyers, as well as a generous amount of time spent exploring Siti and Doan's lives. While the details of the case alone make this an edge-of-your-seat viewing experience, White beautifully layers it with the bigger issues of society's treatment of women, immigrants, and of those in power who will sell anybody out to remain in office. As much as I constantly research North Korea, I had forgotten the twists and turns of this particular case, especially the ultimate outcome. White not only uses great skill in relaying those plot points, but he also makes you care deeply for the two women. Able to send a chill down your spine while also reducing you to tears, Assassins, is a suspenseful page-turner, heart tugger, and one of the best documentaries of the year."

69,the_night_house,critics,fresh,p,"Visually, audibly, and thematically, The Night House is an assaulting film, but because it works best in the gray areas between certainty and hysteria, the filling of the void, as it were, is a bit of a letdown."

74,the_night_house,critics,fresh,p,"A lot of things are scary, but nothing's quite as scary as recent grief. That's the takeaway from this psychological horror film that mostly delivers"
75,the_night_house,critics,fresh,p,"The first clever move The Night House makes is recognising it's floating into busy spectral waters, then ensuring its tension stems from its living, breathing protagonist as much as the frights and fears she's forced to face."
76,the_night_house,critics,fresh,p,"In the realm of horror movies, The Night House might be unconventional, but it's no less powerful, atmospheric, or beautifully acted."
77,the_night_house,critics,fresh,p,"Clever framing, smart lighting and pitch perfect pacing means that, while the tension builds from the opening frames, when it finally reaches a crescendo, the results are chillingly effective."
78,the_night_house,audience,5.0,p,"Compelling, slow, building tension; elements of a ghost story, the occult, and madness. This leads into horror without gore or traditional reliance on jump scares -- but there's often something odd somewhere in the corner of the screen which turns out to be nothing."
79,the_night_house,audience,2.5,n,"It went for two very different directions at the same time, I don't know what to make of the movie. Was it a creature? Was it depression? Either and neither at the same time."
80,the_night_house,audience,5.0,p,"It was beautiful and yet terrifying at the same time. It managed to capture immense elements of grief, and the physiological tension was incredible. It also a delivered a message against self harm or suicide which is very nice."
81,the_night_house,audience,2.0,n,"was a pretty decent flick until the ending. a few loose ends get tied, but SO many more added. i wish they explained what that ending was a little more - ruined the whole thing for me; i want to rate this lower, but that really wouldn't be fair since the rest of the film was fine."
82,the_night_house,audience,3.0,p,"The ending ruins the whole movie. Super underwhelming disappointing ending. Everything is intriguing but sometimes slow. You're curious to whats really going on and when it ends you're left sitting there thinking, ""thats it? what a waste of time"""
83,the_night_house,audience,4.5,p,One of the most pleasant surprise recently in horror cinema with an atmospheric Chiller
84,the_night_house,audience,4.0,p,"this is a really interesting film, one of the best mystery thriller horror movies from 2020.  for some it may have some pacing issues... but for me, it builds up the tension. and was well held by a great performance by the lead actress.. it kept me trying to guess what and when things were going to happen. and it doesn't rely on cheap jumpscares... when it does ... it's done in a tasteful way.  the ending might disappoint some as I've seen other reviews, so I guess its a matter of interpretation as the movie does not give you all the answers I think sometimes is better to leave some kind of mystery... because it may have plot holes as most of the movies.... but in this case, it did not bother me as. other movies I've seen."
85,the_night_house,audience,3.5,p,Great suspense. The story is different and original.
86,the_night_house,audience,4.5,p,"The Night House was an eerie psychological horror, that had many similarities to The Invisible Man, yet enough differences to make this film feel fresh and original. A great plot, and some twists to the story that I never saw coming, is what makes this film definitely worth a watch even if you don't entirely understand it all. The ending was abrupt and I did have to research an explanation for the ending… and as it turns out, it's not too complicated. 

Once/if you understand the plot, this film is entirely worth it. 

It also carries a brilliant metaphor for depression and trauma throughout, which I absolutely admire!"
87,the_night_house,audience,5.0,p,"Absolutely adored this movie. It had me at the edge of my seat the entire time. There are some twists and turns that I could not predict. Great performance by Rebecca Hall, very impressed how she portrayed her character's sadness & depression mixed with existential vertigo. After THAT ending, I still had some questions and cared. Rarely I get to do that. Great movie. Go watch it."
88,the_glorias,critics,fresh,p,"At nearly 2.5 hours, the film could've been shorn a bit, but it's a worthy tribute to an iconic woman's extraordinary life."
89,the_glorias,critics,fresh,p,Julie Taymor's gift for visual storytelling works as both literal and metaphoric depiction of Gloria Steinem's extraordinary life.
90,the_glorias,critics,fresh,p,It is indeed an empowering and uplifting experience...
91,the_glorias,critics,fresh,p,"It's a fitting achievement to a truly remarkable woman, and the strength of an entire movement, and a reminder that, as far as equality is concerned, we still have many more miles to go."
92,the_glorias,critics,fresh,p,"The film lauds all of these accomplishments, but it also takes the time to acknowledge some of the costs of full-time activism."
93,the_glorias,critics,fresh,p,"What a treat to see two terrific actors - Alicia Vikander and Julianne Moore - allowed to creat a portrait of a woman so complex, so well-rounded, so fully and messily human. Brava."
94,the_glorias,critics,fresh,p,The films jumps around a bit - if you're not well versed with the history you might get lost from time-to-time - but it is important recent history and a life story worth celebrating.
95,the_glorias,critics,rotten,n,A very special disaster.
96,the_glorias,critics,fresh,p,"Providing both factual details and relevant ideas, The Glorias acknowledges its subject's failures, as well as successes, and applauds her determination to keep on fighting for her beliefs."
97,the_glorias,critics,fresh,p,"In these precarious times, where we seem poised on the brink between democracy and despair, The Glorias still manages to present a message of hope."
98,the_glorias,critics,rotten,n,"There's a good film to be made about Gloria Steinem, a complex human and a pioneer of later 20th-century feminism. [The Glorias] isn't it."
99,the_glorias,critics,fresh,p,"Poignant and intimate, the narrative isn't afraid to take its time, flowing between decades and locales as if in a free-associative dream state."
100,the_glorias,critics,rotten,n,"The period trappings are colourful, but the script is non-stop exposition."
101,the_glorias,critics,fresh,p,"If all this sounds like a rattle-through, it is, however inventive and thoughtful."
102,the_glorias,critics,rotten,n,A slightly exhausting film that is smothered by its reverence for its subject.
103,the_glorias,critics,fresh,p,"Difficult as biopics can be, The Glorias should have been glorious."
104,the_glorias,critics,rotten,n,"The film's heart is in the right place, but The Glorias doesn't stand a chance with Taymor at the helm."
105,the_glorias,critics,rotten,n,"Steinem is one of the most influential women in the United States in the past 50 years, but The Glorias fails to show exactly why that is. Turning her portrayal over to four different actors is a great idea, but the film never finds its footing."
106,the_glorias,critics,fresh,p,"The Glorias isn't a standard biopic, but it also isn't as radical as its subject. It's an artfully arranged greatest hits package of a remarkable and influential life that dilutes its impact by trying to cover eighty of Steinem's years."
107,the_glorias,critics,fresh,p,[Julianne Moore] ends up carrying the weight of the story. [Full review in Spanish]
108,the_glorias,audience,3.5,p,This was told in an interesting manner.  They jumped around a lot in time.  At first that was confusing and rather annoying since the pattern seemed arbitrary.  It slowly began to make some sense and was interesting.  It was well acted.  I'd recommend it.
109,the_glorias,audience,3.0,p,Bette Midler is in this.
110,the_glorias,audience,4.5,p,Julie Taymor brings an artistic vision of an empowering woman with great direction I'm on her part and acting on all the Gloria actresses' parts.
111,the_glorias,audience,5.0,p,So important. I recommend this to everyone. It's educational and inspiring.
112,the_glorias,audience,5.0,p,"This is a reflective movie of a woman during her lifetime where she is still trying to figure or has figured out who she is both from a personal and social viewpoint.  Although this movie is about Ms. Steim's life, it leaves this impression of what womanhood is defined as. no matter race, gender, sexuality and more!"
113,the_glorias,audience,4.0,p,Excellent telling of the story of a woman and a movement that changed the world.
114,the_glorias,audience,5.0,p,"This is one of the best movies I saw for a while, a very relevant movie today.  It's great the director and movie put women's right, black right, native American, Asian American, gay rights all together, it's human's right! It's a much holistic way to look at things, and what's going on today in the world.  Julian Moore's speech at Catholic church is the most touching one, how in human history, men gradually alienate from nature, but make the church more isolated from nature and built hierarchy with white male God as the image, all the important female figures all became background. I believe in women's movement and the pro-choice. I can't believe it is still being discussed today.  Human has the choice for his/her life, as long he/her is responsible for the the choice he/she made, no one should tell him/her otherwise. That is basic human right! I can't believe the low rating the movie gets. It's the message it's carry that's way more important than the format itself. Do u all get the messages?"
115,the_glorias,audience,2.0,n,"This was not a movie, it was a pamphlet. (And I am a feminist and liberal and I actually stand behind everything that was in the film). Looked good, actors were great (although the accent Vikander did was weird) and the Wizard of Oz scene was great. I learned a lot about Steinem, so that's a good thing. But it was a badly edited cliff notes version of Steinhem's life with exposition instead of dialogue."
116,the_glorias,audience,2.0,n,"The Glorias has good intentions but is an overlong mess. The acting was great. Julianne Moore and Alicia Vikander were both very solid. I like the idea of having Gloria Steinem being portrayed by four different actresses. The execution of it is hit and miss. I liked the scenes where the different Glorias interacted with each other. There are also some nice visual flourishes courtesy of director Julia Taymor. But the film doesn’t always know how to balance all 4 performances. The first hour or so goes back and forth and is a mess. The second half becomes more focused, but not enough to make me give this a positive review. The film is also nearly two and a half hours long. Many scenes drag and run on for two long. Overall, I get the ambition, but the execution was pretty lackluster. The film was a disappointing mess. Moore, Vikander, and Steinem deserve better."
117,the_glorias,audience,5.0,p,Julie Taymor is a master storyteller and always finds a new way to tell her story with creative visual surprises. It was also a treat to see Bette Midler play Bella Abzug.
118,come_away,critics,fresh,p,...a subtle story of the redemption possible via imagination...
119,come_away,critics,rotten,n,"The remix of two classic tales, Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland, never achieves lift off as a flight of fantasy."
120,come_away,critics,rotten,n,"If you don't try to wrap your head around the deeper message it may or may not be making, then Come Away is an enjoyable, however forgettable drama about the fragility of childhood. Thinking about it for too long may make you lose track of reality."
121,come_away,critics,rotten,n,"It's unlikely kids will understand these issues, though they aren't treated with enough complexity to engage adults. I'm struggling to work out for whom Come Away appeals."
122,come_away,critics,rotten,n,"Yet, for all its ambition and manufactured charm, this lands as a rather lacklustre melodrama."
123,come_away,critics,rotten,n,"I was really ready to be transported, and really disappointed when I wasn't. It's a real shame, because there's a lot of talent in this film but it just doesn't work."
124,come_away,critics,fresh,p,"Angelina Jolie is at her usual best playing a grieving mother with restraint and poise, but it is David Oyelowo's fatherly emotions that will touch your heart."

126,come_away,critics,rotten,n,"But parents be warned: despite attempts to blend Alice In Wonderland with Peter Pan and emphasise the power of a child's imagination, it has some pretty dark moments."
127,come_away,critics,rotten,n,"[I]t's a mostly misbegotten affair, hamstrung not so much by some decidedly wooden acting (as it's nearly Christmas, I'll mention no names) as by a whimsical premise that simply doesn't work."
128,come_away,critics,rotten,n,"This is definitely a tonal soup but, despite the myriad ingredients, the result is still somehow tasteless."
129,come_away,critics,rotten,n,"As well as being glum, though, it's convoluted, and it gains nothing of value from its Lewis Carroll/JM Barrie mash-up."
130,come_away,critics,rotten,n,"We fully expected the children to take a deep dive into their respective fantasy realms... Instead, the plot seems to fall down an overwhelmingly depressing rabbit hole that it can't seem to climb its way out of."
131,come_away,critics,rotten,n,"Assembled with scattershot ineptitude by the Brave director Brenda Chapman, it smacks of a Ken Loach project rebooted by Nickelodeon, but not as compelling as that sounds."
132,come_away,critics,fresh,p,"It never quite tumbles into Wonderland, but the ambition at play - and a top cast of supporting players - is just enough to let Come Away off the Hook."
133,come_away,critics,rotten,n,"The second word in the title should perhaps be replaced with ""off it"". Or maybe replace the first word with ""go""."
134,come_away,critics,rotten,n,"Chapman is unable to make the more flamboyant touches - such as the fusions of reality and fantasy, often dreamt up by Peter - fly, and it's shot without much energy or style."
135,come_away,critics,rotten,n,"Peter Pan/Alice in Wonderland origin story has grief, peril."
136,come_away,critics,rotten,n,"This fairy tale-tinged costume drama shows what happens when drawing from classic children's literature yields stillborn, dispiritingly literal-minded results."
137,come_away,critics,rotten,n,"Two origin stories in one holds promise on the page, and it's entertaining seeing all of the Peter/Alice myths explained. But while the magic simmers, it never comes to full boil."
138,come_away,audience,1.0,n,A movie meant to fool kids.
139,come_away,audience,3.0,p,"Come Away is a magical world mixing concept that doesn't truly enchant. The Peter Pan and Alice origin stories may bypass children, but we appreciate the attempt, even if you're never quite transported to Neverland."
140,come_away,audience,3.5,p,"The movie was alright, not the best story I've seen. The plot was intriguing but did let me down, kinda. The story evolved but never really arrived anywhere.

The cast made the movie watchable. A very positive thing I have to add was the cinematography. The movie itself was very aesthetically pleasing :)"
141,come_away,audience,5.0,p,"This particular ensemble was surely not pieced into a masterpiece for only the mundane, quite specifically for the sublime....... not for those that are vaulted stories beneath the Earth's surface, collecting dust above towering shelves, whose thoughts cannot be captured through lenses; deemed much too disconcerting to remain adrift awaiting momentum into the drain of status quo........ who should watch this, who shouldn't watch this..... Whoever, whenever......... gobbledegook who wasn't too shook?

All I know is that after I was more than I was before I set my sights elsewhere as the credits rolled up and the final seconds halted to complete."

143,come_away,audience,5.0,p,"I absolutely loved this film. I thought it was beautifully done and a wonderful mashup of fantasy and reality. I feel it showed such wonderful perspective of life through the eyes of children. It was a beautiful story and was beautiful to watch. 

Highly recommend"
144,come_away,audience,3.5,p,"Not nearly as bad as everyone says it is, it combines elements of bridge to terebithia, beasts of the southern wild, and classic fairytales to bring out some sweet moments; also; kudos to Angelina Jolie."
145,come_away,audience,0.5,n,"This movie was okay. But, I do not think it should be rated PG. Mostly because of the topics. 

1) Rose (Angelina Jolie) turns to alcohol to deal with the grief of her son, David (Reece Yates). Young kids who see this will think of alcohol as a way to cope with stressful situations which is not something you would want to promote in a children's movie. 

2) Then, Alice (Keira Chansa) finds the bottle in her mother's drawer and proceeds to drink what's left in the bottle causing her to feel dizzy and end up in a new world (kind of like being drunk). Keep in mind, Alice is only eight. She uses this ""potion"" as an escape (she even says ""Take me away"" before she drinks it). 

I did enjoy the movie, but I don't think the rating is appropriate. I also don't really think the movie's target audience's age (most likely younger children as it is fantasy and has Peter Pan and Alice) would understand the topics being discussed (the father's issues as an example). And it kind of put a tragic spin on childhood favorites if I'm going, to be honest. Basically, there were a lot of non-child friendly topics (i.e; alcoholism, gambling, fraud, torture, etc.).
There also was not much magic/fantasy in it. The themes were depressing and tragic. Also, if you think about the ending, Peter most likely ended up running away from home and living in the streets with the gang they met previously. It went from imagination to hallucinations in my opinion. 
Otherwise, it was a decent movie. Great acting and cinematography."
146,come_away,audience,0.5,n,It was not a movie our kids or us parents enjoyed. It was sad and dark and never really took off. The kids found it boring. It could have been a magical story but fell flat when you thought it would finally take off.
147,come_away,audience,2.5,n,"""Dishes and arithmetic...what a dreadful day.""

Absolutely, 100% needed a better title.

Jolie is in more than expected and the film looks as regal and beautiful as any fairy tale should. Big kudos to cinematographer Jules O'Loughlin. It's simply a shame writer/director Brenda Chapman (Brave, The Prince of Egypt) couldn't match her ambition with reality here. 

As it turns out, this is yet another take on Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland as applied to the growing pains of garnering more pain and a better understanding of the world around you. It's a nifty idea (if not obviously derivative) and the tone is absolutely on point, but for a movie about how magical we can make life if we so choose the proceedings of Come Away strangely lack that special spark."

Some moron decided to take what could have been an interesting story and turn it into an idiotic art piece that is filled with just terrible direction and production decisions. I didn't even think ""The Current War"" was all that great, but at least it was watchable. Whoever greenlit this idea is an idiot, and anybody who knew what this would be and didn't immediately quit the project deserves to have their judgement questioned in the future."
171,tesla,audience,1.5,n,"I really cant believe that N. Tesla was so wooden and never changed his expression.
Continual frown,bland, flat dialogue by Hawke. Couldnt wait for it to end."
172,tesla,audience,3.0,p,"I liked its bold approach to the typically stuffy biopic genre, but it misses as often as it hits and a strong first half loses its spark in the second. Maybe that's the point, Tesla promised more than he could deliver, but that doesn't make for a satisfying narrative for a film."
173,tesla,audience,3.0,p,Interesting biopic. Shame that it didn't focus on all of his inventions 6/10
174,tesla,audience,1.5,n,"I really wanted to like this movie, because I think Tesla was a great man. But this was terrible. It was completely disjointed, so much that it was hard to follow. There was no character development, no relationship between the characters, no narrative thread. Ethan Hawks did no acting: he maintained the same scowl throughout the whole movie. The way it was filmed was weird and unpleasant. Completely wasted 2 hours."
175,tesla,audience,3.0,p,"Interesting to watch, but didn't work for me overall."
176,tesla,audience,2.5,n,"Very surreal, not a documentary or a joker like follow someone into madness. Very little on his inventions.  There are much better Tesla documentaries available."
177,tesla,audience,1.5,n,"Disjointed, confusing and weak. Inaccurately portrays one of the greatest inventors and minds the world has ever see. For some reason J.P Morgan's daughter is main character and switches between lead role and looking at camera talking to audience using modern day technology. When Tesla sings Tear For Fears - Everyone Wants To Rule The World I had to make an account here and rate it. It was so bad I believe it was funded by The Edison Estate"

180,leap_of_faith_2019,critics,fresh,p,LEAP OF FAITH is a powerful statement of an artist about the many influences on his art and how his beliefs inform his ability to create.
181,leap_of_faith_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Not a commentary, not a ""making of"" documentary, but rather an invitation for the director of The Exorcist to declare the wonder of his own work. Presented beautifully with plenty of clips of films and other art that Friedkin refers to."
182,leap_of_faith_2019,critics,fresh,p,"A detailed, if straightforward, making of documentary that connects the dots between the filmmaker and his faith in an interesting, if long-winded way."

199,leap_of_faith_2019,audience,5.0,p,this was fascinating. if you're a fan of the film -- or even if you're not & you're just curious about how it became -- this was a great watch.
200,zola,critics,fresh,p,"The filmmakers, writers and cast are so criminally funny they should all be hailed for shining a light on a serious subject and then arrested by the vice squad for their naughty humor."
201,zola,critics,fresh,p,"While trashy and divisive, Zola's resistance to safe, conventional filmmaking is highly commendable."
202,zola,critics,fresh,p,"It's a wild, crazy ride that starts quickly, moves quickly and finishes quickly."
203,zola,critics,fresh,p,"May have all the shiny, shallow sheen of a sexed-up road movie, but underneath the gloss is a beating heart and a bold critique on womanhood and their autonomy."
204,zola,critics,fresh,p,"Zola doesn't always make the most of the original text, but it's irresistibly hilarious and packed with committed and entertaining performances."
205,zola,critics,rotten,n,"All in all, the tale of what happened in the aftermath of her extended saga sounds a lot more fun than the adventure itself."
206,zola,critics,rotten,n,"It's not all that full of suspense -- tending to plod where it should careen, and plateau where it should escalate."
207,zola,critics,fresh,p,"Showing a sharp eye for stylish editing and verite camerawork, director Janicza Bravo stirs up a rich, decidedly dark blend of hooker comedy and gangsta drama, with the flow of prostitute patois often sounding a lot like street poetry."
208,zola,critics,fresh,p,"Without the anchoring presence of Paige and Keough, though, this film might have been a disposable, candy-coloured tour of Florida sleaze."
209,zola,critics,fresh,p,"As played by an excellent Taylour Paige, Zola feels too smart for this. It's a sharp performance that grounds everything revolving around her, particularly when it all becomes too frenetic in the film's latter half."
210,zola,critics,fresh,p,"Bravo is eminently worth watching as a director; the movie at its pure-cinema finest is like a neon mandala. But, man, does this film give off some discordant vibes."
211,zola,critics,fresh,p,"When it's all said and done, it's the technical approach and performances that make Zola memorable. Bravo overlays a dream-like quality over the narrative, making it seem hyperreal and grounded all at once."
212,zola,critics,fresh,p,"By encapsulating the fringes of youth culture and the intersection of social media with sex, we are gifted a film that says a lot about what America thinks about money, women, the uneducated, and people of color."
213,zola,critics,fresh,p,"Rooms feel as claustrophobic as they are expansive, with mirrors being the only consistent feature. Even when one tries to look away, the situation they're in is reflected back at them."
214,zola,critics,fresh,p,"By its end, Zola feels like a hazy dream sequence, complete with a kitschy aesthetic - surreal in its storytelling and satisfying in its representation."
215,zola,critics,rotten,n,"Yeah, it might elicit a few laughs, but it's also embarrassing and unsettling."
216,zola,critics,fresh,p,"It's very arch and very funny in its tone... It's sort of vibrating at this slightly scary frequency, and it really walks the line between comedy and drama."
217,zola,critics,fresh,p,"Although most of its charm comes from sheer novelty and shock value, it features bonafide star-making performances from Riley Keough and Taylour Paige, and might just be the perfect summer movie for a raucous indie crowd."
218,zola,critics,fresh,p,"A film that brashly merges traditional and disorientingly new ways of telling stories, and finds both chaos and wisdom in the chasm between them."
219,zola,critics,fresh,p,"Zola manages to be as funny as it is frightening and, thanks to superb performances from Taylour Paige and Riley Keough, makes an impact that certainly outlasts the underwhelming ending."
220,zola,audience,4.5,p,Enjoyed it. Very stylized. Loved the kinetic energy of scenes and spit-fire dialog. Pulls you in from the very first scene.
221,zola,audience,4.0,p,"Zola is innovative filmmaking at his peak. It's surreal, colorful and grainy.
It sure is incredible how someone was able to turn a Twitter thread in a movie and somehow make it work really well.
It's to praise how such a ""silly"" movie touches prostitution-chains and sex with such maturity.
Janicza Bravo congrats! You did a great job with something that in other hands could be a disaster."
222,zola,audience,3.5,p,Creative style and plenty of interesting characters. Much better than I expected.
223,zola,audience,4.5,p,"A movie based on tweets may not sound exciting, but Janicza Bravo takes some real life stripper drama and carves out a wonderful sensuous piece of art.  The entire cast is developed and even the bit players have purpose.  While narratively the film gets a little clunky in the third act, the drama and tension feel real, but the conclusion is just a little bit over the top.  Credit to the casting of Taylour Paige and Riley Keough who have a fantastic chemistry.  Colman Domingo can transform into any character and his turn here is no exception.  More Domingo the better!  In a lot of ways there is no conclusion and that may leave moviegoers a little put off, but the ride is so enjoyable it's what needs to be remembered about this picture!  Final Score: 8.8/10"
224,zola,audience,4.0,p,"Starts fast, goes fast and finishes fast. It is not a complain, quite the contrary. ""Zola"" is a tour de force that forces us to lose all the conventions we had about cinema and the way in which certain topics should be addressed. It also sends that of the feminine gaze to the side for Bravo's intrepid direction not only lends itself to bringing a visual distinctive to the film, but also captures with humor, in a transgressive, sometimes almost voyeuristic way, the difficulty of its themes that resonate in a story full of chemistry between its protagonists. Being the first movie inspired by a Twitter thread is not a favorable point per se, but it is admirable for many things."
225,zola,audience,3.5,p,Moral of the story don't hang out with people you meet in under a week.
226,zola,audience,2.0,n,2 out of 5 stars. Terrible film based on a twitter event of a stripper who got pulled along to a road trip with another. Only to discover she is getting set up to sleep around for money. Boring film. Over done performances. A script that is annoying with dumb dialogue. And dull direction.
227,zola,audience,1.0,n,Zola is a disappointing film. It is about a stripper named Zola who embarks on a wild road trip to Florida. Taylour Paige and Riley Keough give horrible performances. The script is badly written. Janzica Bravo did a terrible job directing this movie. I was not impressed with this motion picture.
228,zola,audience,2.5,n,This was Very A24 in a way that just didn't work for me. Also felt like it was trying very hard to be campy despite being a truly harrowing story? Idk! Taylour Paige was great though.
229,zola,audience,1.5,n,A movie as dumb as the strippers in it.
0,the_nest_2020,critics,fresh,p,"I watched The Nest in a fixed state of unease, shoulders tense and set forward even in a plush cinema seat, my mouth immediately drying out after each sip of my drink."
1,the_nest_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Director Sean Durkin previously made Martha Marcy May Marlene, and he once again finds the same sense of cinematic unease that made that film so brilliantly unnerving."
2,the_nest_2020,critics,rotten,n,"There's plenty of atmosphere and an interesting set-up, but hints at malevolence afoot lose their momentum and the early promise winds up nowhere"
3,the_nest_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Earthy and intriguing, this intensely personal drama has a terrific balance of humour and darkness, keeping the audience on edge with a subtle sense of foreboding."
4,the_nest_2020,critics,fresh,p,There's something commendably old fashioned and decidedly unassuming about The Nest. Durkin's direction is both precise and admirably restrained in its depiction of an era famed for its excesses.
5,the_nest_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Love is an impenetrable thing for the O'Haras - which makes every begrudging attempt at it even more fascinating to watch in this riveting, reluctant family portrait."
6,the_nest_2020,critics,fresh,p,A psychological drama about the 'get rich quick' attitude of the 1980s and the damage it caused.
7,the_nest_2020,critics,rotten,n,Coon's performance and the film's clammy atmosphere are more interesting than the story's psychology.
8,the_nest_2020,critics,fresh,p,The Nest is a belated cautionary tale - this tainted family is a skeleton in the closet of our current socioeconomic climate.
9,the_nest_2020,critics,fresh,p,"A cautionary tale told with an unflinching gaze that suits the boldness of the decade in which it is set. It fairly whizzes by, compellingly, gruesomely, fascinating."
10,the_nest_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The Nest is a bold feature developed by a promising filmmaker, who feels established even two feature films in. For Law and Coon, their performances elevate an already sharp script on class dissection, marriage and aspiration."
11,the_nest_2020,critics,fresh,p,This is a film that swerves away from categorisation.
12,the_nest_2020,critics,fresh,p,The movie ploughs ahead through three acts of delicious torture.
13,the_nest_2020,critics,fresh,p,A rather inconsistent vessel for its towering lead performances.
14,the_nest_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The Nest does, at least, give Law and Coon free rein to tear into their roles like lions into a fresh kill."
15,the_nest_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The film is elegantly shot, with a gorgeous wardrobe to match and a soundtrack to relish, including Bronski Beat, The Communards, The Psychedelic Furs, The Cure and New Order. The Eighties weren't all bad."
16,the_nest_2020,critics,fresh,p,It's a slippery mood piece which tantalises by imploding on purpose.
17,the_nest_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Despite his ninnyish image, Law can be a fine actor. Here, his character flawed and cocksure, he proves exactly that."
18,the_nest_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The Nest has the trappings of a haunted-house movie but delivers something much scarier - the slow death of a marriage, performed to perfection by Jude Law and Carrie Coon."
19,the_nest_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The Nest nails the exhaustion of keeping up appearances, the damage that is done by dishonesty, and the sheer creepiness of living with a liar."
20,the_nest_2020,audience,5.0,p,"It surprised me to see the low audience score on this. It's a beautifully constructed movie. Durkin delivers without cause for concern as to whether or not he is pandering to the modern audience's lack of focus.
It's a powerful story told within the confines of a world that dominated the 1980's hippie era. Law and Coon are a force on screen. Of note is the way Carrie delivers her facial expressions conveying a simmering pain under her sophisticated exterior. The association to symbolic gestures in the movie concerning the horse and the house are all wonderful choices.
The director has been fearless in his decisions to produce a slow burn, simmering piece of cinema which is sure to be heralded as a masterpiece once it has reached enough considered movie goers eyeballs."
21,the_nest_2020,audience,2.5,n,"An ordinary movie about an ordinary family that moves to the UK from the USA and continue having money problems, going to work, going to school, going to parties, arguing, and eating meals together... and that's about it.  It's like 90 minutes of a really good start to something and then it just ends."
22,the_nest_2020,audience,0.5,n,"Please do not waste nearly two hours of your life with this less than mediocre drivel.
There is no plot, there is no story. It's utter rubbish. How Mr Law can associate himself with this dire tirade"
23,the_nest_2020,audience,0.5,n,"What a horrid, pointless, boring movie. Billed as a thriller, there is no tension in the film and no threat to cause tension - really. There's no stalker, no murderer, no blackmailer, no mystery. There's nothing to cause tension. It's basically about a dishonest person and the family he moves from the States to the UK chasing big business deals that never materialize. The kids hate their new school, the wife hates their new home and the husband acts like he's wealthy when he's actually broke. That's the story....no point and no ending. I mean, the ending literally is (spoiler alert?) them sitting down to eat breakfast. That's the end. A horrible waste of time."
24,the_nest_2020,audience,1.0,n,"Slow, tense, painful"
25,the_nest_2020,audience,0.5,n,Absolute meandering drivel. shallow story line with nothing to hold the viewers interest
26,the_nest_2020,audience,3.0,p,"If the trailer prepared me for yet another indie drama dissecting a marital breakdown that I've seen numerous times before (thanks, Noah Baumbach!), the subtle, economical and precise manner writer-director Sean Durbin opens his film and lays out the relationships and tensions within the O'Hara family certainly piqued my interests and almost made me look forward to the rest of the film. Jude Law and Carrie Coon plays the central couple, one Brit, one American, negotiating life in American suburbia before Law's ambitious and restless Rory upends everyone's lives by moving the family to England. However, as the indie drama charts the different challenges arising from this relocation, the plotting begins to feel familiar, if not predictable, as events slowly deepen their feeling of isolation and despair that we already sensed they're facing. Durkin's grounded screenplay thankfully resisted melodramatic cliches, which were set up but never come to fruition, though I did find the step-daughter's arc inconsistently and less organically written than the others. Atmospherically constructed with an underlying sense of dread and dreariness, the film hints, momentarily, of a genre surprise or at least a narrative detour, but they are quickly and abruptly abandoned, like when a tinge of horror and the supernatural creep in when Coon's wife Allison finds a locked door suddenly left ajar in the old mansion house she's practically imprisoned in (or is it a metaphor? Because this film loves a metaphor); or a brief interlude introducing Anne Reid as Rory's mother that feels like we've switched over to a Mike Leigh film that I wouldn't mind staying longer for. While Durkin clearly demonstrates his skills as a director and Law and Coon give nuanced and affecting performances, it's also drenched in indie drama tropes that I find somewhat hard to get particularly excited about."
27,the_nest_2020,audience,0.5,n,"I went to see it with two friends, each of us kept from looking at the other, waiting for something to actually happen, or make sense. When the film ended for no clear reason with a blank screen, we burst out laughing at the stupidity and uselessness of this awful film"
28,the_nest_2020,audience,5.0,p,"Loved the movie.  Great acting and interesting storyline, with lots of suspense.  Would have loved to see their next move."

36,feels_good_man,critics,fresh,p,"Feels Good Man might not help you understand our current state as a nation, but it is a perfect record of it."
37,feels_good_man,critics,fresh,p,...A stark reminder of how easily media can be taken out of context and warped into something evil.
38,feels_good_man,critics,fresh,p,"This comprehensive, intelligent film goes to unexpected places and, because of its subject, uses comics and animation in an organic, creative way."

42,feels_good_man,critics,fresh,p,A documentary reclamation project...
43,feels_good_man,critics,fresh,p,"This engrossing documentary follows the character's gentle creator, Matt Furie, as he tries to reclaim his frog from the hatemongers."
44,feels_good_man,critics,fresh,p,"The upsetting, depressing, even frightening interviews allow a greater theme to rise as they contrast with snippets looking into Furie's life."
45,feels_good_man,critics,fresh,p,"...a commendable deep dive, not unlike a higher-budget version of a Fredrik Knudsen video, immersing itself in the subject throughout its many, many twists and turns."
46,feels_good_man,critics,fresh,p,"This film reminds viewers of a basic communication principle: no matter the intent of someone who puts a message into the world, once it's out there, that idea no longer entirely belongs to the messenger. Some part of meaning always lies in reception."
47,feels_good_man,critics,fresh,p,Most interesting is a look in how the 4Chan malcontents grew into a group so antisocial it viewed the rise of Trump as its own victory.
48,feels_good_man,critics,fresh,p,"[A] story of a man fighting the good fight, trying to maintain one's own integrity in a world gone crazy, even if it just means gaining back control over a simple cartoon frog"

50,feels_good_man,audience,5.0,p,Now I know that a cartoon frog has more political power than I'll ever have.
51,feels_good_man,audience,4.0,p,"A very tough film to locate, but well worth it, 'Feels Good Man' details the origin of the internet meme Pepe the Frog mostly through the eyes of its creator, Matt Furie.  Arthur Jones has put together a very detailed debut documentary covered just about every aspect of Pepe and Matt and the shifts in both.  The quest is to turn Pepe back into the character he was intended to be and not a symbol of hate.  Speaking of hate the Anti-Defamation League doesn't come across as tolerant, accepting, or willing to change.  The more you know!  If you have a library card check this out on Kanopy.

54,feels_good_man,audience,5.0,p,"I just finished a screening of this film by one of my favorite YouTube channels. Matt and the director were there after for a interview. This really is a fantastic movie. Way better than I imagined. If anyone wants to understand meme culture in the future this movie should be the first thing people view. Easily a 5 star documentary. It was oddly emotional too. More emotional than you would imagine a documentary about a internet meme would be. It really does have you cheering for the original creator. Pepe is now a world wide symbol meaning almost anything you could imagine. A symbol for everyone from white nationalists, anti-fascists, free loving individuals, to Hong Kong pro democracy protestors. Amazing documentary.

Love the actor and actress, the movie was very promising, but left you with a sour, ""artistically meh"" taste in your mouth that only an alien Pouffe could produce.  So tired of these Hollywood movies that ""leave it to the audience"".  This movie is much like the downtown art critics that eat at terrible restaurants so they can talk about it on Monday morning by the espresso machine ""You ate where this weekend?  Cockroach Danny's?  I heard they charge $600.00 for a cockroach head souffle?  How absolutely divine darling!""  People say they like this ending so they too, can sound sophisticated... The ending was garbage, like real garbage that hangs on a fancy, New York art gallery wall at 1.5 million, containing real human feces.  ""It's art Jenna, and me and Stephan have to have it having above our dinner table!  We'll be the talk of the town"".  Such promise, only to deliver a lukewarm meal, that lacks any true substance before and after the credits roll."

85,save_yourselves,audience,4.5,p,"Delightfully wacky, quirky and loaded with charm, Save Yourselves! accomplishes a lot with very little. We follow the lives of millennial couple, Jack and Su, played by John Paul Reynolds and Sunita Mani respectively, as they attempt to disconnect from the cyberworld for a week in a remote cabin in the countryside. Prior to their departure, we are shown what their day-to-day lives look like and, speaking for the millennial generation, it is, shamefully, all too familiar. (Nights spent sitting silently side by side on the couch, scrolling through social media, take-out containers littering the coffee table... Sound familiar to anyone else)? The chemistry between our two leads is undeniable and delightful, and once they make their trek from New York City out to the New York countryside, we are treated to even more delicious helpings of their fantastic relationship dynamic. While we are shown a believable range of emotions between the two, never is the boundary line of cringe breached, thankfully. Despite it being a film about an impending apocalypse, it remains purely comedy until the final 15 to 20min. At a runtime of 90min, those 75min of comedy and storytelling are pure gold. Much of the comedy we enjoy is derived from the change of scenery from city to countryside and our characters simply trying to adapt to being so out of place, (including their borderline incompetence in traditional gender roles). In truth, both actors are simply so damn likeable, your laughing muscles are likely primed for contraction without you even realizing it. So when they act on impulse, simply doing or saying what we know their characters probably really would do or say, it's laugh-out-loud perfection--comedy at its best. One recurring joke in particular, regarding Reynolds' character Jack, in which we are shown the effects of his sleep abnormality, never stops being funny. Additionally, the comedic element is masterfully elevated by Andrew Orkin's goofy score. Certain scenes, could have easily been misconstrued as suspenseful, and maybe for our characters, they are; but we as the audience are likely to be laughing throughout these sequences, thanks to Orkin. Still other scenes where the score shines through, are in sudden, brief moments that are equivalent to a less painful episode of ""You hit my funny bone,"" or perhaps, more similar to a baby's reaction when Jack (not Reynolds' Jack) pops out of his box? Either way, they catch you off guard in the best way, leaving you laughing in unadulterated delight. As the film moves into its final act, you won't know what to expect. Surely, there can only be one possible outcome right? Wrong. And before you even get there, there's an unexpected curveball. As for the end, you won't see it coming. Those who have already seen the film are likely divided on whether they found the ending fitting or not. Though it's safe to say, it's interpretable and open for discussion, which many of the best films are."

111,the_nowhere_inn,audience,4.0,p,"I really enjoyed this mockumentary. I will start with the obvious: the live performances footage is beautifully filmed, focusing on the little gestures and stage shenanigangs that all St Vincent fans have come to love. 

I think it's a brave ""performance"" of St Vincent since development-wise her character is not portrayed in the nicest light possible, so to speak. Obviously it's clear to everyone that it's, yes, a mockumentary, but still, I'm pretty impressed with her acting. The touches of humor are really good and I LOVED the vibe of the first scene in the movie, I just wished there would have been a bit more of that. 

If you enjoy meta-movies related to music and you are familiar with the work of CB and St Vincent, it's a very enjoyable movie with lovely imperfections."

I laughed I cried.  "" Better than Star Wars better than E.T. """
114,the_nowhere_inn,audience,3.5,p,"“This is how actors play rock stars in movies.” St. Vincent sets out to make a documentary about her music, but when she hires a close friend to direct, notions of reality, identity, and authenticity grow increasingly distorted and bizarre. The Nowhere Inn is an absurd, comedic, and thriller that I’m still trying to wrap my head around. It’s hard to pinpoint the genre, but whatever it is, it’s working. This played apart of the midnight selection at Sundance 2020, and I remember it looked interesting (all of the midnight ones did that year) but I didn’t understand what it was about. Even watching the trailer, it barely covers what it’s about. St. Vincent (Annie Clark) and her real life friend Carrie Brownstein wrote and starred in the movie, of course. They have this amazing chemistry that didn’t need any building beforehand. Everything you see is genuine. Though they’re playing themselves, they have a unique character that we know isn’t how it’s like in real life. St. Vincent does fantastic with the transformation she goes through. It’s so fun to watch her go through it all. And Carrie Brownstein, who I haven’t really seen much before has really good acting skills. Had those two not been cast in their own movie, and I’m not sure if they originally started out writing themselves in, I don’t think they could’ve pulled it off. The story is extremely satirical. Once you start to realize what the movie is about, and it makes a point to it, you can see some of what will unfold. It pokes fun at documentaries and rockstars and performers and they way it’s done is really cool and fun. When you consider the movie as a whole, then it gets a little more confusing. It’s like a movie within a movie within a movie (I think that’s right). What we mainly see is a mockumentary style story. There’s different aspect ratios and styles to differentiate what story or movie we’re focusing on. And the cinematography is pretty good. There’s sequences shot on film, mostly the concerts, that are beautiful to look at. And it’s edited really well. There are many achievements to be noted. With how trippy it is, it can be hard to figure out what the movie is trying to say. But that’s also a point made in the movie where someone says something along the lines of “I don’t think she really understood the movie we were making.” A little more clarity would’ve helped, but I like having the mystery there. For a little bit the same things keep happening and I wanted a little more variety. It’s one of those things where I thought they’d move on and show something else, but they keep going back to it. As a character, it’s frustrating for Carrie but she lets it happen for some time. Nevertheless, this is a really fun movie. I was in the middle of watching it when my apartment building had a power outage so I had to watch it in halves. You need to be attentive and ready for anything when watching. By the end it goes completely off the rails and I’m not sure how to interpret it. Maybe a little more reading will help. Overall, The Nowhere Inn is a surprising movie that I would like to revisit again. It does land with everything, but for a psychological movie (that’s the genre I’m going with) it has great craft and great start for Bill Benz to make more movies!"
115,the_nowhere_inn,audience,5.0,p,"Love St Vincent, very hilarious mockumentary and even funnier bit with Dakota Johnson"
116,the_nowhere_inn,audience,5.0,p,"I absolutely loved this film, I was laughing so hard at the absurdity of it all. It has a very psychedelic feel to it, but still manages to focus on a plot, which is constantly twisting and turning. The whole concept they created of mocking a tour film is genius and who better to do it then Carrie and Annie- both being fantastic musicians who have a long history of touring. 
The cinematography was top notch and both Carrie and Annie were performing at their absolute best, I enjoyed every minute ❤️ 
Go see this movie, you won't regret it."
117,the_nowhere_inn,audience,3.0,p,It's as if Andy Warhol and Andy Kauffman got together to write the character St. Vincent and then they found a college graduate who loves David Lynch movies to direct the picture. It was hard to watch at times and is more of a fake-u-mentary. Her music I still find to be bland after watching the movie. Loved the texas scene.
118,the_nowhere_inn,audience,4.0,p,"I found this to be a hilarious dark comedy.  I'm glad I saw it, but the ending didn't tie things up in a satisfying enough way for me to give this 5 stars."
119,the_nowhere_inn,audience,4.5,p,"Okay, some background to my position vis-a-vis this movie: I have been to 2 St Vincent concerts and I loved her work since the first album. At the first concert I went to circa Actor, I went by myself, I was in my late 20s, and that era of St Vincent in concert was loose and classic rock concerty. There was eventually an extended moment where Annie shredded her guitar on her knees by a monitor out on the apron of the stage and I had a sort of cosmic epiphany about feminism and the planet. It's not really effable, so I'm gonna leave it at that. But I guess what I'm trying to say with that is: I understand from a specific place the desire for a St Vincent concert film. At the second concert (eponymous album tour) in London, we walked into our balcony seats and there was one seat that was reserved with a sign for ""CARRIE BROWNSTEIN"" and my partner and I were like !!!! THE Carrie Brownstein?! And sure enough, just before curtain THAT Carrie Brownstein showed up and sat, for about half the time. And one dude walked up to her and she was clearly polite to him, and then a few more, and I knew I did not want to join that crowd, so I did not attempt to say hello or have a selfie with Carrie Brownstein. That second concert was so much more choreographed than the first one I went to. 
And all that brings me to this movie. Which I really like. I haven't read ""professional"" reviews yet, but I've seen headlines along the lines of ""doesn't hold together"" and ""too many ideas"" and sure, it definitely gets very shaggy near the end. But I think it would be really interesting to survey the genders of those reviewers, because something about this film's concerns with selfhood and celebrity and human connection are, I think, *saturated* in gender considerations. It is a deeply feminine problem to have to agonize over whether being nice or being a Bitch is the worse choice. The shagginess, the zig-zagging camp to camp horror to mind-bending surrealism to Lynchian red curtains all just work for me as a pretty straightforward (I mean, haha) analogy of the minefield that is being a person, a persona, a self, entangled with other selves close and far."
120,four_good_days,critics,fresh,p,"Kunis - fearlessly going full-on anti-glam - and Close are on the same level here, giving strong performances in the service of a so-so screenplay... Keep your expectations modest."
121,four_good_days,critics,fresh,p,Both actresses give their all to the parts and serve as the calling card of Four Good Days.
122,four_good_days,critics,rotten,n,"Four Good Days ultimately amounts to 100 middling minutes, and wallows in ... schmaltz."
123,four_good_days,critics,fresh,p,She [Close] is a master of carrying her characters' histories in her eyes.
124,four_good_days,critics,rotten,n,"The film is as harrowing as it is indulgent, as rooted in reality as it lost to hyperbole."
125,four_good_days,critics,rotten,n,"While the film's leading cast gives fantastic performances, Four Good Days lacks focus and fails to expand upon its emotionally powerful moments."
126,four_good_days,critics,fresh,p,"While It's painful to go on this film's journey fighting addiction, the most redeeming feature is Close and Kunis' acting. But we were really hoping Four Good Days would turn into a more satisfying hour and 40 minutes."
127,four_good_days,critics,fresh,p,"Surprisingly quiet for a story as harrowing as this, the film features strong performances from its ... leads, Mila Kunis and Glenn Close, who star as Molly and her mother, Deb."
128,four_good_days,critics,fresh,p,"Director Rodgrigo Garcia knows how to bring out the nuances in his actors' performances, and audiences looking for a study in acting will be rewarded, even if the movie is a tad formulaic."

130,four_good_days,critics,fresh,p,Rodrigo García directs in a way that breaks your heart but gives hope as well. The film is for addicts and those who love them.
131,four_good_days,critics,rotten,n,"Although Close and Kunis' performances are undeniable, Four Good Days never truly touches the heart."
132,four_good_days,critics,rotten,n,Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of this shallow movie is left unexplored: why doesn't Deb look in the mirror at her role in Molly's addiction?
133,four_good_days,critics,rotten,n,"Four Good Days lacks the dramatic finale act that hits a much-needed emotional punch. While it never stops being convincing, the film is also too earnest and ultimately boring."
134,four_good_days,critics,rotten,n,"It's difficult to fault an actor the caliber of Close, who imbues Deb with all the requisite nonverbals to suggest this is a performance which belongs in a better film."
135,four_good_days,critics,rotten,n,"Except for [Close] the film is earnest and well-intentioned, but also rather predictable and by-the-numbers."
136,four_good_days,critics,fresh,p,"The film features two remarkable performances, with Kunis as we've never seen before. She's so good that Close is overshadowed several times."

140,four_good_days,audience,3.5,p,"Saw this on the flight to Orlando....very good movie with superb performances from Glen Close and Mila Kunis.   Tough to watch, no doubt.   But a real eye opener to the world of drug addiction.  3.5 stars."
141,four_good_days,audience,5.0,p,"Wow. This was an amazing movie and spoke to everyday struggles the user and the loved ones deal with. Some people won't ever have to experience this, but for the ones who have can say this movie could not have been more true. Wonderful acting and showing awareness of addiction and what loved ones go through."
142,four_good_days,audience,3.5,p,"The critics must have watched this movie while sitting on a block of ice in a freezer. I don’t know how anyone could be so hateful toward a movie that deals with that kind of topic so empathetically. I have seen a lot of reviews from critics saying that it “follows the same kind of addiction story as every other addiction movie”, to which I say that is true, and that is because every addiction sucks and is painful in some way or another to recover from! What a dumb thing for these paid critics to say. The reason my review is 3 and a half stars, and not 5, is because I do wish that the film had a bit more character development as to who these people were before these 4 days. But overall I think it was a beautiful and very effective film with some amazing performances."

144,four_good_days,audience,5.0,p,"This was literally one of the best movies surrounding addiction recovery and hope that I have ever seen. Mila Kinos blew me away with her emotionally charged acting. I've seen my fair share of movies like this...but I've never actually been in tears like I was at the end of this movie. I don't often take the time to write reviews about movies (never) but I had to here. I couldn't recommend a movie more than I do this one. It's raw, it's genuine, it's real. It's as close as fiction can mirror  reality."
145,four_good_days,audience,5.0,p,"I have seen mixed reviews on this movie. People have said that Deb doesn't look at her role in Molly's addiction. People say there is not enough to the story. I believe the point to this movie is to show the madness of addicts and the enablers in their lives. I know what it's like to try to keep someone sober. You will go crazy with it. This movie was a snapshot of addiction. I think it is more authentic to show actual human emotions. In real life it is rare for the enabler to do the best thing. In real life it is unlikely for a white knuckler who tries to stop using cold turkey to be sober for 7 days without relapse. The point was to give a glimpse in the disease. Not to make you feel good. Deb always has to be on high alert. Molly will always be an addict. She will need to make the choice everyday to stay clean. It is not an easy life for either woman. If you were watching this movie for happily ever after, the you have missed the point."
146,four_good_days,audience,2.0,n,"While this film has some brilliant acting, I feel the storyline is not very accurate with regards an addicts life.  I understand that this is based on a true story and it's always wonderful when someone can overcome addiction but as it was stated in the movie, 97% don't have this kind of outcome.  As I watched the last scenes unfold, I was preparing myself for the aftermath of Molly but got the Hollywood ending.  Addiction is a real crisis in this country and I was hoping that a big movie like this might bring some light on this terrible affliction but just got the same old same old."
147,four_good_days,audience,2.5,n,The writer or director needed to review the screenplay because it feels like it's written for a short film or some kind anti-drug PSA commercial however you won't feel inclined to switch it off after the cold intro scene. Kunis' career best is here and Glen Close shines in every scene.
148,four_good_days,audience,5.0,p,This movie is a glimpse into the reality of a struggling drug addict. I give it a 100% because I once was addicted to heroin as well but by the grace of god I have been in recovery for four years and counting.. maybe this movie will open the eyes of those who pass judgement towards drug addicts and people struggling with addiction themselves.. there needs to be more awareness and less stigma about addiction because unfortunately the reality is that drugs are taking over our communities everyday! Less stigmas and more awareness ! #endthestigma
149,four_good_days,audience,5.0,p,What a great movie!! Opioid addiction has affected so many people the last 10 years. This showed a realistic depiction of the pain this disease causes!! Glenn Close did an amazing job portraying a mother who just wanted her child to be clean and healthy!

175,the_perfect_candidate,critics,fresh,p,"Avoiding melodrama and the well-worn tropes of ""woman taking on a man's world"" stories, director Haifaa Al-Mansour and co-writer Brad Niemann immerse us in a culture that might be evolving from a Kafkaesque nightmare into a milder Kafkaesque bad dream."
176,the_perfect_candidate,critics,fresh,p,[Haifaa al-Mansour's] connection to her home country shows - there's a familiarity to al-Mansour's lens.
177,the_perfect_candidate,critics,fresh,p,"Even if Al-Mansour plays to an audience she knows is already on her side, The Perfect Candidate is still telling a story that ought to be told."
178,the_perfect_candidate,critics,fresh,p,Director Haifaa Al-Mansour once again explores the complexities of being a woman (or girl) in Saudi Arabia through a charmingly direct and confident main character who subverts the status quo.
179,the_perfect_candidate,critics,fresh,p,"Al Mansour, who also co-wrote the script for The Perfect Candidate, depicts the strength of family bonds in reversing the small cruelties Maryam is subject to, at the same time gently taking men to task for their absence and neglect."
180,the_perfect_candidate,critics,fresh,p,The Perfect Candidate is a low-key charmer that manages to accomplish something that might seem otherwise impossible these days: it makes you feel slightly -- slightly -- optimistic about the contemporary political process.
181,the_perfect_candidate,critics,fresh,p,Snappy soap opera story about female empowerment.
182,the_perfect_candidate,critics,fresh,p,"The Perfect Candidate could be the second installment to what Wadjda started. It might not be as great as the latter, but it's close."
183,the_perfect_candidate,critics,fresh,p,"It really liked it. It's not a doom and gloom movie -- it's about ""how can you use your influence?"""
184,the_perfect_candidate,critics,fresh,p,"It has an almost comic tone at times. I wouldn't call it a comedy, but it's a very light dramedy."
185,the_perfect_candidate,critics,fresh,p,What I appreciated about this was the subtleties -- she's doing things in small victories.
186,the_perfect_candidate,critics,fresh,p,"Mansour gives audiences a candid, often wryly amusing glimpse of life inside the Saudi kingdom, which is so often cloaked in opacity and menace."
187,the_perfect_candidate,critics,fresh,p,"The Perfect Candidate lacks a distinct visual grammar ... but as a film that recognizes the giant strides small wins can make for women, it feels significant."
188,the_perfect_candidate,critics,fresh,p,"...the whole film is teeming with life, and al-Mansour balances the restrictions Maryam must daily face with vivid portrayals of the joys of sisterhood and the dynamics of all-female gatherings..."
189,the_perfect_candidate,critics,fresh,p,"The pleasure of the film rests not in the plot, which is so placid as to be anti-dramatic, but in the minutiae; as ever, Al Mansour homes in on the everyday workings of condescension and conformity."
190,the_perfect_candidate,critics,fresh,p,An underdog tale that also offers perhaps the most expansive look at contemporary Saudi Arabia in a feature film.
191,the_perfect_candidate,critics,rotten,n,The Perfect Candidate ... becomes a bit too distracted by Abdulaziz's story and the broad ideas of Maryam's campaign to dig into ... deeper issues.
192,the_perfect_candidate,audience,4.5,p,"The Perfect Candidate is a wonderfully subtle and not at all on-the-nose movie in its feminist message. It takes an important look into the changing Saudi society when it comes to basic women's rights, making it very timely as it captures this important period effortlessly. The acting is great and the ending is quite moving. This is an even better, more confident movie from Haifaa al-Mansour than her previous feature, Wadjda. Both films were snubbed by the Academy for some reason."
193,the_perfect_candidate,audience,2.5,n,"I wanted to like 'The Perfect Candidate' much more than I did, but it's all too often unfocused and wandering.  There's a subplot here that sometimes engulfs the film.  When on track and focused on the titular character, this Saudi Arabian feature is best.  There are quite a few cliche moments, in this female empowerment story.  Final Score: 5/10"
194,the_perfect_candidate,audience,5.0,p,"Well worth watching. Well paced, humourus and interesting insight into (some) women's lives in the ME. Great performance from the leading lady."
195,the_perfect_candidate,audience,5.0,p,"I loved the movie!  A chance to get a glimpse of Saudi society. Very nicely done. Well acted, nice music and touching."
196,the_perfect_candidate,audience,4.5,p,"Terrific screenplay showing family conflict, personal growth, cultural/religious background, and political dynamics.  The basic story is about the eldest daughter in a family of Saudi musicians who has become an MD because she has stagefright, and who signs up to be a candidate for the rural municipal council as an offhand byproduct of trying to get a computer error corrected so she can have permission to leave the Kingdom and attend a conference in Dubai that will give her a chance for a job in Riyadh that will get her out of the anti-woman bias at her local medical clinic.  On top of everything else, the film gently satirizes modern political campaigning."
197,the_perfect_candidate,audience,3.5,p,"A subtle, yet steadfast account of the types of oppression being challenged and overcome by women like Haifaa Al-Mansour. Her characters are likeable, with the family and their lives being relatable. Its approach isn't about drama or high levels of tension, but instead focusses on the everyday lives of people"
198,amulet,critics,fresh,p,"A confident and effective debut, heightened by strong performances, stylish direction and an original script that creates its own mythology."
199,amulet,critics,fresh,p,"In this brooding, atmospheric, ultimately transgressive mystery of mothers and martyrs, we witness destiny, cult and divine (but also self-inflicted) punishment playing out their never-ending ritual"
200,amulet,critics,fresh,p,"It's a confident, incredibly striking debut for Garai. Amulet is a commited, complex and genuinely surprising horror film."
201,amulet,critics,fresh,p,"A bold debut feature from Romola Garai, Amulet may be too dense for some but rewards the curious."
202,amulet,critics,fresh,p,"AMULET is a well done and affecting film of justice coming to the perpetrators of violence through means you would not normally expect. Quiet but unrelenting, it winds its tentacles around those who imagined that they had gotten away clean."
203,amulet,critics,fresh,p,"Amulet is a horror film that masquerades, holding its secrets tightly within itself, waiting till the right moment to spill forth truly fantastical truths, letting its madness run amok in your brain."
204,amulet,critics,fresh,p,"Amulet might fade into obscurity as one of many quiet, borderline indecipherable indie horror films in the world. As it stands, it's an interesting entry into an evolving horror sub-genre that I wholeheartedly look forward to seeing more of."
205,amulet,critics,fresh,p,Demons from the past come alive in Romola Garai's surreal feature length debut. [Full review in spanish]
206,amulet,critics,fresh,p,"...the most technically ambitious of these films, and through the first two-thirds, at least, it's jaggedly compelling..."
207,amulet,critics,fresh,p,There's certainly something captivating about [Garai's] approach to the genre.
208,amulet,critics,fresh,p,"This debut film from Romola Garai is to be commended on all levels: its technical proficiency, its aesthetic beauty, its affecting and unusual story, and its stand out performances."
209,amulet,critics,fresh,p,"This odd, offbeat, and visually fascinating horror fable may meander a little, but its final destination makes for one of the most memorable scary tales of the year."
210,amulet,critics,rotten,n,I didn't understand the start of this movie; I didn't understand the middle of this movie; I didn't understand the end of this movie. It gets a few points for creepiness but that's all.
211,amulet,critics,fresh,p,"Creepy, bloody, and flat-out weird in places, Amulet is a bold directorial debut for Garai and a disquieting reminder that getting rid of the past is never very easy."
212,amulet,critics,rotten,n,The boldly ambitious and psychedelic Amulet is ultimately too cryptic for its own good; you are unsure of the characters' motivations or what exactly Garai is trying to say.
213,amulet,critics,fresh,p,Amulet is a bold and impressive directorial debut.
214,amulet,critics,fresh,p,"It's a promising film for a promising director, one who still hasn't arrived but has been noticed."
215,amulet,critics,fresh,p,"A moody, disturbing, and very peculiar directorial debut. Perplexing? Sure. Mesmerizing? Definitely."
216,amulet,critics,rotten,n,"Amulet certainly deserves a lot of credit for having some twist-filled elements that add intrigue to the story. It's too bad that these plot twists arrive so late in the film ... The weak links are the movie's screenplay, editing, and overall direction."
217,amulet,critics,rotten,n,Brutal monster movie is twisted but artfully gooey.
218,amulet,audience,3.0,p,"With more confusion than scares, Amulet leaves viewers with questions that demand answers five minutes after the movie ends, until they go do anything else. So… demons need guardians now? Why exactly? So… he (Alec Sacareanu) did kill it (Anah Ruddin)? Was he supposed to kill it from the beginning? Oh, so he's the… ya know what, I'm doing it again. I had very few notes on Amulet. It wasn't bad enough for me to rage-write, but not good enough for me to recommend or really detail. Imelda Staunton commands whatever scene she's in, maybe they should've given her more than three of them. Skip it."
219,amulet,audience,2.5,n,"Strange, true. Stuff to think about afterwards, yes. But just one really good jump/adrenaline rush and then icky stuff we have seen before.  A bit slow."
220,amulet,audience,1.0,n,1/5 stars only. 1/2 star for one jumpscare only. 1/2 more star for showing very delicious food. The rest is rubbish. Haha.
221,amulet,audience,1.5,n,I’m probably spoiled by Ari Aster vision of visual horror movie and it’s story peak - I try to like this movie but it drags i fast forward some scene just to finish it
222,amulet,audience,2.0,n,This movie didn’t have bad acting but it was no fun at all and wasn’t very scary either outside of having a dark feel to it . 2.1
223,amulet,audience,3.5,p,If you're not a fan of horror movies with thinly-veiled social commentary as their main theme then this one is probably not for you. But if you do like a film that takes societal conventions and flips them all over the place then I highly recommend Amulet. While not 'scary' per se there is enough suspense and gore to keep longtime horror fans interested.
224,amulet,audience,4.0,p,"Weird, kind of cerebral, surprising at times and a twisty ending. Worth a look for a really interesting and unusual film experience. Parts of it make you go ""what?"" and parts you have to decide for yourself. Carla Juri as Magda is fantastic, and gets better and better as the film progresses."
225,amulet,audience,4.0,p,"After watching three terrible horror films in a row, 'Amulet' was a welcome retreat, taking its sweet time to unravel."
226,amulet,audience,2.5,n,"As someone who loves slow-building, atmospheric horror, this should have really done it for me. But the screenplay and structure of the story just feel too sloppy to fully get into it. I appreciate the way this takes its time in building mood but definitely needed a different approach on how the narrative was constructed. Ari Aster fans will probably dig this though. The ending feels straight out of something he'd do."
227,amulet,audience,4.0,p,Challenging and fascinating. And pretty f’d up.
0,dick_johnson_is_dead,critics,fresh,p,"The film's looming grief is compounded by the nature of her father. Dick Johnson is a remarkably funny human being. Funny, buoyant, thoughtful..."
1,dick_johnson_is_dead,critics,fresh,p,"The emotional honesty of this film is by turns elating and heartbreaking, with Kirsten not scared to let her feelings show on camera alongside those of her dad."
2,dick_johnson_is_dead,critics,fresh,p,Created with an artist's insistence that realization of a vision justifies what some might call exploitation...
3,dick_johnson_is_dead,critics,fresh,p,"Even the crew loves [Dick Johnson], and I think the audience will too."
4,dick_johnson_is_dead,critics,fresh,p,A true privilege to witness. [Full review in Spanish]
5,dick_johnson_is_dead,critics,fresh,p,"Rather than positing better ways of processing death, this film celebrates our inability to do so: inventive as we are, we are no match for it."
6,dick_johnson_is_dead,critics,fresh,p,I don't know if I've ever seen anything like it.
7,dick_johnson_is_dead,critics,fresh,p,"For those who have watched loved ones fight a losing battle with Alzheimer's, the movie might seem unappealing, but Johnson's deeply compassionate, even hopeful tone could be a balm for her fellow grievers."
8,dick_johnson_is_dead,critics,fresh,p,"Every good parent deserves to be celebrated the way that Kirsten Johnson honors her dad in Dick Johnson is Dead. His condition may be sad, but the film gives many more opportunities to smile and appreciate him than it does making you cry."
9,dick_johnson_is_dead,critics,fresh,p,"Dick Johnson is Dead is the emotional roller coaster of the year and, beyond that, a life lesson. [Full review in Spanish]"
10,dick_johnson_is_dead,critics,fresh,p,"That title, Dick Johnson Is Dead, says a couple things-one is that this film doesn't flinch from the reality of death. The other is that maybe we can find a way to lighten up about it."
11,dick_johnson_is_dead,critics,fresh,p,"Corrals all of the difficult emotions of five years into a moving, insightful sketch of a family relationship."
12,dick_johnson_is_dead,critics,fresh,p,"Dick Johnson is Dead is a daring masterpiece about the loss of loved ones, and of memory, and the movies' ability-and, also, inability-to make the impermanent permanent."
13,dick_johnson_is_dead,critics,fresh,p,"The director's last feature, Cameraperson (2016), weaved together unused footage from a career's worth of cinematography assignments in a stream of consciousness manner, and her work this time around is no less fluid."
14,dick_johnson_is_dead,critics,fresh,p,Kirsten Johnson's monument to familial love and the artistry of cinema is one of the best films of the year...
15,dick_johnson_is_dead,critics,fresh,p,"Perhaps the best way to sum up Dick Johnson is Dead is through the tone set through Kirsten Johnson's voiceover throughout the film, which is at times funny, at others poignant, and overall self-aware."
16,dick_johnson_is_dead,critics,fresh,p,"More than an exercise for today, Dick Johnson Is Dead becomes a time capsule for tomorrow."
17,dick_johnson_is_dead,critics,fresh,p,Dick Johnson is Dead isn't the old cliché of being about life instead of death. It's very much about death. It's unabashedly about it. It's about the alternating sensations of crying and laughing we feel when we confront it-it'll have you doing the same.
18,dick_johnson_is_dead,critics,fresh,p,"For a moment, Kirsten Johnson has conquered death. That makes Dick Johnson Is Dead a strangely satisfying, yet bittersweet watch in this dark time, when fears of mortality are closer to the surface for most people."
19,dick_johnson_is_dead,critics,fresh,p,"Dick Johnson Is Dead is a deeply personal film, but anyone who has lost or is losing someone to dementia or Alzheimer's will recognize the common struggle within it."
20,dick_johnson_is_dead,audience,5.0,p,"What a sweet, sweet, caring and loving man Mr. Johnson is. This documentary made me smile, laugh, cry and sentimental all at once, if that's possible."
21,dick_johnson_is_dead,audience,4.0,p,One of the most unique documentaries I've seen lately. Dick Johnson Is Dead portrays a father and daughter's way of coping with oncoming death with strong themes on death and people's ways of coping with it. It's a very funny and very touching documentary that moved me to the point of tears. Possibly my favorite documentary of 2020 and one of my favorites in recent memory.
22,dick_johnson_is_dead,audience,3.0,p,"I must be missing something here, because I just don't get the hype behind director Kirsten Johnson's documentary about the last years of the life of her father, Dick, an elderly Seattle psychiatrist besieged by the onset of dementia. Its eclectic mix of content doesn't gel well, despite some of the material being exceedingly well done. It comes across mostly as an often-endearing, loving tribute, though it's frequently weighed down by far too much extraneous, incidental and, at times, repetitive material. Then there are the picture's fictional segments in which the director presents comically gruesome stagings of her father's demise (a la the macabre suicide sequences from Hal Ashby's ""Harold and Maude"" (1971)) as a means of coping with Dick's impending passage (most of which aren't especially inventive or funny). Taken together, this amalgamation of material just doesn't mesh and leaves viewers with a confusing portrait of what the filmmaker was attempting to accomplish. Perhaps recutting the footage would have helped, but, as it stands now, this one doesn't come through as it should."
23,dick_johnson_is_dead,audience,3.5,p,"Dick Johnson Is Dead is a 2020 American documentary film directed by Kirsten Johnson 😇 

It's good 🙂
I'd recommend it if you like this genre 👍🏼"
24,dick_johnson_is_dead,audience,4.5,p,A loving tribute that is as much about capturing memories as its is about creating them. Imaginative in its storytelling.
25,dick_johnson_is_dead,audience,5.0,p,"""There's those times when you need to cry. I'm talkin' about a real cry. I'm talkin' about you need to open up your soul and have a weep-a-thon.""

Thank you, Dane Cook-this is true and if you ever need an impetus for such a moment Kirsten Johnson's documentary about her 86 year-old father, Dick Johnson is Dead, is more than happy to provide as much. Made in order to relieve if not necessarily alleviate Dick's fear of death and his daughter's fear of losing him, Dick Johnson is Dead may very well be the best, most moving film I see all year. 

Seriously though, I probably cried every three minutes."
26,dick_johnson_is_dead,audience,3.0,p,"Dick Johnson Is Dead is technically quite accomplished, the fantastical imagery is quite cinematic and some parts are quite inspirational, but I unfortunately could never shake the feeling that what the director was doing with her father here was ethically wrong and that ambiguous morality question plagued the entire project."
27,dick_johnson_is_dead,audience,4.5,p,"Smart, creative and brave in it's very own, very personal way."
28,dick_johnson_is_dead,audience,4.5,p,"RATING: A-   Director: Kirsten Johnson 
Dick Johnson is Dead is a very special documentary. The documentary mixes humour with deeply emotional scenes and it always succeeds in doing so. This documentary gets even more emotional when you see that the Filmmaker, Kirsten Johnson, is actually the daughter of the film's subject, Dick Johnson. I'm happy that I made this my first real documentary."
29,dick_johnson_is_dead,audience,0.5,n,Kristen Johnson said this was a comedy and I didn't see it like that. I also didn't see any cohesive story. Also watching Michael Moore doing a Q&A with her and he's just lobbing her questions and complements because they work together. I don't see the feeling in this doc. I didn't feel anything. It's a long interpretive performance.
30,horse_girl,critics,fresh,p,"Festooned with beads and fabrics, Horse Girl is visually inventive and ultimately succeeds on the grounds of Alison Brie's unwavering and longtail commitment to playing more than just the pretty girl."
31,horse_girl,critics,fresh,p,"A career-best performance from Alison Brie and a complex, thoughtful approach to mental illness."
32,horse_girl,critics,fresh,p,"Amongst the metaphor and pathos, it's Brie's performance that stands out."
33,horse_girl,critics,rotten,n,Everything produced by the Duplass Brothers is hollow and superficial and cutesy. Their examinations of the bourgeoisie lack depth and flatter their audience...
34,horse_girl,critics,rotten,n,"This movie is definitely not about horses. If you want to watch a conspiracy-theory movie with sci-fi gimmicks that have been done much better in other films, then feel free to waste about 104 minutes of your time to watch Horse Girl."
35,horse_girl,critics,fresh,p,"There is a lot going on in Horse Girl (2020), and it very nearly manages to pull it off."
36,horse_girl,critics,fresh,p,A luminous and colorful indie with surprising amounts of realism. [Full Review in Spanish]
37,horse_girl,critics,fresh,p,"By the end, viewers have whiplash and a distinct sensation that the script needed several more drafts, but they aren't bored."
38,horse_girl,critics,fresh,p,"Horse Girl unfolds like a fever dream, appropriately. A twisting narrative built upon strong performances. The end is far from satisfying, but that's part of its charm."
39,horse_girl,critics,fresh,p,"Brie's performance is powerful and the film's editing does a superb job of mixing Sarah's obscured perception with reality, succeeding in offering an unsettling look into the mind of someone who suffers from a severe mental illness."
40,horse_girl,critics,fresh,p,"An ambitious, odd project, and one that sticks stubbornly in the mind's eye."
41,horse_girl,critics,rotten,n,The film looks like it's shipwrecked. Adrift. [Full review in Spanish]
42,horse_girl,critics,fresh,p,"The conclusion is meaningfully painful and actually felt like an invitation to revisit the film, a privilege afforded to streaming flicks that is too rarely exploited."
43,horse_girl,critics,fresh,p,"An incongruous, engaging ride, Horse Girl doesn't hit all the marks, and some audiences will become deterred, but Brie's tour de force performance is truly the base and it's one worth jumping off from."
44,horse_girl,critics,fresh,p,"Mental illness as the engine for a thriller is a cultural conceit whose days are numbered, but, as a last gasp, there's no denying this entry is compelling and evocative."
45,horse_girl,critics,fresh,p,"Young woman battles mental illness; sex/nudity, language."
46,horse_girl,critics,rotten,n,"The second half of ""Horse Girl"" loses rhythm and tension, finding the writing irritatingly light on detail when it comes time to submerge the lead character in complete insanity."
47,horse_girl,critics,fresh,p,"Brie is rawly convincing as a troubled woman for whom the sides of reality have become too slippery, transformed into the heroine of a private sci-fi melodrama."
48,horse_girl,critics,fresh,p,"The character writing truly is Horse Girl's greatest strength, what makes it notable instead of a dime-a-dozen straight-to-streaming movie."
49,horse_girl,critics,fresh,p,"Horse Girl is a strange movie ... It might not always make sense, but it still works; it's the kind of movie that'll leave you scratching your head ... in a (mostly) good way."
50,horse_girl,audience,3.0,p,"I wasn't sure what to expect. Decided to give it a watch as had nothing else to do. It was pretty much all over the place, I couldn't work out if it was about mental health and schizophrenia or it was really about alien abductions. 🤔 it was weird. However, it was extremely powerful and amazing acting from the cast. Especially the lead. Very believable."
51,horse_girl,audience,2.0,n,"Despite strong performances from Alison Brie and the rest of the cast, this poorly executed production combined with Jeff Baena timid directorial style, fails to levitate, weighted down with an ambitious story of alien adductions, cloning, time travel, a horse? Ambiguously, conveniently simmered into a mental illness pottage."
52,horse_girl,audience,3.5,p,"Rather bizarre, but entertaining enough.  Alison Brie did a good job (as she normally does)."
53,horse_girl,audience,3.5,p,"I like bizarre and strange things and therefore I liked this movie. (Spoiler alert.) Either this is a story about a mental illness or about something stranger. In both cases the story is interesting. If this is a story about a psychosis, it is an interesting journey that allows us to see how the world might look like in that state. It is also quite scaring that a person who is in that state is released from mental hospital to go back home live alone which I guess is unfortunately pretty common these days."
54,horse_girl,audience,5.0,p,"It is awesome! We have this feeling when we are watching like ""what the hell is going on"" and it's just what they wanted us to feel, because Sarah feels that way. I think some people are so bored in their lives (and always expecting distracion) that they lose most of the meaning of things on a film like that, because it's not bullshit entertainment. It is a deep movie for deep people."
55,horse_girl,audience,1.0,n,"Pathetic. Gross waste of time. Why do good actors try to do ""different"" stuff and end up with basic nonsense?"
56,horse_girl,audience,1.0,n,"Nonsense. The film suffers from a lack of coherence that has become all too common in the sci fi genre.  Filmmakers no longer try to tell a story with these films, instead opting to paste clips together haphazardly and leaving it to the audience to come up with a narrative. Very disappointing and a waste of a superb performance from Allison Brie."
57,horse_girl,audience,3.5,p,I'm gonna be honest this movie is a mess... but I think it's supposed to feel messy it's supposed to feel like your going crazy along with the main character
58,horse_girl,audience,4.5,p,"I don't understand what people didn't like about this film. I thought it was perfect as is. Tremendous performances, visually breathtaking, and not cut into bite sized chunks and fed to you like a child. Loved it. Absolutely loved it."
59,horse_girl,audience,4.0,p,"After letting this movie marinate in my head for a few months I have decided that it's alright. At first it seems like a jumbled mess, but there is an explanation behind some of the things going on."

68,on_the_record,critics,fresh,p,"On the Record co-directors Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering don't lose sight of the overall message...Sexual misconduct should not be excused because of someone's race, and #MeToo survivors should not be shamed or pressured to keep silent because of their race."
69,on_the_record,critics,fresh,p,"On The Record does a good job of showing that Black women feel like they have been forgotten during these advancements. For all of us to move forward, their voices need to be heard."
70,on_the_record,critics,fresh,p,"It's a poignant reminder for black women that relief can be found if their voices are heard. In order to do that, society needs to listen and On The Record is an important place to start."

You literally watch a woman (Drew Dixon among MANY others) discover their voice therefore discovering their place in the world again as they brave sharing their scars for the world to see. The fact that Oprah dropped out of this is baffling to me.  Whatever her issue was with the ""artistic direction"" was not worth trying to shelf the truths of these women."
86,on_the_record,audience,5.0,p,"This doc touches on POC women affected by sexual assault in a way that other films haven't. For me - as a white woman - this film dives more deeply into the complex, intermingled, social contracts between men and women, and more specifically between men and women WITHIN minority populations in the US. 

Aside from the primary focus on sexual assault, power, and race - I was deeply touched by the conversations about what we lose as a society WHEN TALENTED WOMEN DISAPPEAR. I think Drew's story, and her early successes, help us feel the deep implications and loss around this question. 

At on point Drew talks about her pain. She says her pain and her creativity lived in the same compartment of her coping mechanism - this description of how these traumas live inside and alter the course of a person's life is extremely impactful in how we should think about the effects our actions have on others and society."

110,ema,audience,4.5,p,"My favourite Larraín's film is an umpredictable and compelling study of society and female freedom that features a visceral performance by its lead, a woman who brilliantly changes the order of everything surrounding her in order to reach her own purpose while redefines the meaning of the well-known word "" mother"". And even though, specially towards the ending, ""Ema"" feels a little tired, the impression it leaves the viewer since the beginning never fades until the last shot."

And for the most part they were. The story looked interesting too, but boy howdy, this was some of the worst writing I have ever seen. It alternated between being boring and being offensively stupid. Terrible choices. I walked out halfway through."
113,ema,audience,3.5,p,"""Ema"" new film by Pablo Larrain has a strong script that contrasts with a constant search for a visual identity.

The Chilean feature has a first act viceral and full of symbologies, we have a script that grows so much that it gets lost among its characters and tells stories we don't need to see, the deliberately distorted timeline doesn't talk to the film's editor, the which ends up making everything more confusing and tiring.

However, Ema has great performances, mainly by the couple Ema and Gaston, and a very raw and dirty photography, which combines well with the atmosphere on screen, it is also worth highlighting the great soundtrack, and the sentimental expression of the plot through basically video clips.

Pablo also makes beautiful open air shots, which while cute are claustrophobic and dirty, makeup and costumes are also great, highlighting each character's unique personalities.
""Ema"" is a visually interesting film, with a good direction that proposes to do more than the plot asks for, getting a little too contemplative and allegorical, and problematic editing, but we have great elements, good acting and an interesting script . NOTE 7.5/10."
114,ema,audience,2.0,n,great visual and the story has potential but found it to be exhaustingly incoherent at times.
115,ema,audience,4.5,p,Unique and filled with surreal moments. Magic balance of bizarre while seeming grounded in reality.
116,ema,audience,2.0,n,"Pablo Larrain's new film opens with a hypnotic dance sequence intercutting with scenes that succinctly introduce us to Mariana Di Girolama's Ema, a dancer/teacher and her older husband/choreographer, Gael Garcia Brunel's Gaston. After an adoption that went horribly wrong causes a rift between them, Ema concocts a wildly ambitious plan that involves a lot of seduction and copulation to get the child back. This promising but fragmented and disorientating opening is well formulated and mesmerizing to look at but what follows unfortunately is the cinematic equivalent of a hot mess. Sergio Armstrong's striking and powerful cinematography is the best thing here, beautifully capturing a Valparaiso under attack from Ema's flame thrower and vividly staged dance sequences that's a feast for the eyes. However, the script and the way it was handled is alienating and horrendously inapt. Instead of settling down and unpacking the narrative in a watchable and convincing manner, the film continues irritatingly in that same fragmented and disorientating style all the way through. Motivations are confusing and unclear but her plan seems to hinge on one thing: that Ema can seduce and sleep with anyone of any gender. This conceit however is ludicrous and unsupported by how Ema looks and behaves, which is closer to a spoilt brat dressing up for Halloween as a sexy prostitute and missing the mark entirely. As a character study it tells us nothing profound or compelling and it criminally even makes the normally wonderful GGB looks dull and boring. The ridiculous and unintentionally laughable plot is something maybe an Almodovar can get away with but devoid of any wit, humour or coherency here, the film simply ends up falling gracelessly flat on its face."

Even after watching som ‘explained' videos, i still don't exactly know what the hell happened in the movie. And the ending was Ridiculous, with no conclusion to any of the madness I had just sat through for 2 hours! Part 1 made full sense and I was interested in where it goes, but it went off the rails in part 2. It's like I was watching a sequel to Mother! Only mother made more sense. Seriously what was with all the eating in part 2, and that woman with a stomach bug? It was all just so odd. Garbage... and I love artsy ideas in movies. This one just does not pull it off for me."
164,black_bear,audience,3.0,p,"Spoilers within: Somewhere between WTF and just how do any movies get made with so many moving and unruly parts, and immense egos liable to do anything on or off screen? It is a parody or black comedy more than black bear. When the bear finally shows up to apparently eat Aubrey whole, it is a metaphor for nature is going to win no matter how many movies we watch or don't. It was like woman meets married pregnant couple in a remote friendly house by the woods, and soon becomes woman goes after married man whose crazy pregnant wife (hold the alcohol, honey) flips out on hubby and girl found in flagrante delicto, resulting in apparent harm to the fetus as they all rush off for medical attention. Then the light bulb goes on and someone says let's end that shit here and do a satire of moviemaking after all, and on we go with quirky off-set types, and a movie star so bonkers she screws up the filming, while everyone at the shoot wrap says she done great. Is producer Aubrey saying what I think? That both moviemaking and movies are lucky they can find their asses with both hands? Or that when you are tired of  shootemups, boy meets girl, horror, FBI-CIA, Westerns and war sagas, try doing something, anything, that is different, new ground. A for creativity, C for moviegoing experience. I still like Aubrey and her quirky ways and characters. Sarah always classes up the place, even this one."

By the end the only message being screamed through the screen is, ""Look at all the drama and hard work we go through to bring you plebes movies!"" Audrey Plaza was fantastic at the beginning of the film but by the end I had lost all connection to her character…. I was expecting some crazy twist at the to tie the two parts together, but I quickly saw through the facade and realized this was yet another film depicting the ""elite"" actors showing us just how out of touch with reality they actually are."
167,black_bear,audience,3.5,p,"Lawrence Michael Levine's bizarre, ouroboric, perhaps even solipsistic, film is an odd one to crack but fascinating to experience and perfect for post-viewing debate in the bar. It's also one of the few rare occasions where it's beneficial to know a few minor spoilers beforehand so you're prepared going in. Essetially, it's a film of 2 halves that mirror each other and follow very similar narrative beats. Both involve a couple in some form of distress being tested by the arrival of a third party. In the first, Aubrey Plaza is a film-maker lodging with Christopher Abbott and Sarah Gadon's couple in their quiet and gorgeous lakehouse complex, where passive aggressive resentment simmers between the couple as sexual tensions brew between Plaza and Abbott. As the first story reaches a crushing climax, the film somersaults into the second, in the same location but constrastingly, it's awash with people making an indie film where the storyline is practically identical to the first story we've just seen. Abbott is the director and Plaza his star while Gadon plays the third party this time, both in the fictional film they're making and in Plaza's character's increasingly paranoid head. It's a visually striking film that covers multiple topics including feminism and the blurring line between reality and fiction, and also between art and life. The sprawling randomness of it all that would normally exasperate me, I find instead oddly and enigmatically appealing. Perhaps it's the finely drawn performances by the main trio, with Plaza on sensational form; or perhaps it's Levine's deft handling of the material which examines one of the oldest story in the book with such freshness and playfulness; either way, I was totally intrigued by this strange, dreamy film even if I've no idea what the black bear means."
168,black_bear,audience,1.0,n,"Bravo to the cast, but this is writing is garbage. A play in two parts and one is significantly longer than the other? What's the point? There's no clear reason, logically or emotionally why this movie needed two parts that were tied together by wet spaghetti noodles. But the symbolism in red clothes! Give me a break, Schindler's List. And continuing on that theme, what was the point of showing us how these people were terrible to each other? Yeah, they suck pretty bad. So what? This read like a good 3rd draft of a college film thesis. Aubrey Plaza was phenomenal though, no cap. The rest of the cast too. They carried this Flintstone's car of a film."

But surprisingly, the case of the Long Island beaches murder cases hasn't been one that has been covered that often. With powerful performances from Amy Ryan, Thomasin McKenzie, and Gabriel Byrne, and Lola Kirke, the movie centers around the story of Marigil Bert and her fight to find her missing daughter. With her pursuit to find her daughter, she ends up bringing attention to other unsolved murders that have happened in the region as well. The film works in a lot of ways in terms of creating a tense atmosphere. The tone makes for a dreary watch, and it follows suit with a lot of true crime related productions. Amy Ryan is one of the most underrated actress in her generation, and she delivers an amazing layered performance as Mari. The grief, anger and determination she shows in her performance helps elevate the film. Overall, a solid, but tough film to watch."
199,lost_girls_2020,audience,3.5,p,This movie is based on a true story and its straight up one of the most depressing movies I had ever seen. See this movie for the people who were killed so they will never be forgotten.
200,lost_girls_2020,audience,2.0,n,"Lost Opportunity is a more appropriate title.  The film takes an amazing interesting and captivating story and provides a very mediocre viewing experience.   Gabriel Byrne is always a strong screen presence but the film is flat.  I do think the story is important and I do give it extra credit for bringing the issue to the forefront that the emphasis and characterization of the victims as ""sex workers"" dehumanizes them and wrongly seems to mitigate the loss.    These women, regardless of what the circumstances, were innocent victims of a serial killer that is still, likely, at large.   I understand this may have ben the point; however, the filmmakers could have done more with it."
201,lost_girls_2020,audience,1.5,n,"A very poor telling of this story.  Unfortunately, the movie devolves more into a character study of just how b!*chy and annoying the mother could be and far less about the daughter, other victims and the murderer.  Amy Ryan's performance is very good, which is a real negative because her performance steals the show.  Because she is so detestable, and there is so little focus on the victims, it does not lend itself to the level of sympathy and empathy necessary to make this movie a success."
202,lost_girls_2020,audience,5.0,p,"realistic, emotional who- done-it movie for those who don't have their head up their ass for what's really going on with young women who have been trafficked."

1,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Director Florian Zeller makes light work of this adaption of his play, using the camera to recreate the claustrophobia and uncertainty of relying on an uncertain mind."
2,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Anthony Hopkins is one of the best actors alive right now, undoubtedly. The Father was one of the best surprises of 2020, with an incredible visual concept that blows my mind when I think this is Zeller's first film. [Full review in Spanish]"
3,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"[Much] of the strength of the film lies in Anthony Hopkins' lead performance alongside Olivia Colman, Zeller's direction is nothing to sniff at."
4,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,It's a film that's worth more for its conception and execution than its ideological discourse or social agenda. [Full review in Spanish]
5,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Memory is not linear, and 'The Father' captures what it must feel like when memories stop connecting. Anthony Hopkins gives one of his great performances."
6,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,The film seamlessly blends genuine fear with overwhelming sadness.
7,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Hopkins...has never been better. And, given his much garlanded career, that really is saying something."
8,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Watching The Father feels like watching a particularly good episode of Black Mirror, without any of the tech paranoia."
9,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"A forensic examination, powerfully written and delivered with brio, of the impact of dementia on a retired engineer and those closest to him"
10,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"The word ""devastating"" is used so much as to be almost devalued. But, in its truest, most powerful sense, The Father is devastating."
11,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"There is no gawdy tricks, nor leaning on tropes. From start to finish The Father is exactly what you see it as. Confusing, scary, loving, and sad."
12,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"It has an exceptional script, and not only because of the dialogues' quality, but because it plays with what the viewer sees and understands. [Full review in Spanish]"
13,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"[Anthony Hopkins] is absolutely remarkable here. I read the screenplay, available online, out of curiosity, and what he brings to the words on the page is beyond and beyond and beyond. Hopkins has played King Lear (twice) but this is his real King Lear."
14,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"The way Zeller and his production designer Peter Francis orchestrate these changes are almost imperceptible, but nevertheless disorienting and utterly crucial to the narrative."
15,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,Watching two great performers together provides The Father's highpoint.
16,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Without resorting to exploitative, amped-up mystery or obfuscation, Zeller and co-writer Christopher Hampton have fashioned a sort of gaslight thriller in which the mind is both predator and prey."
17,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Zeller has delivered not only the best film adaptation of the season, but one of the most effective, moving and, dare I say, cinematic films of the year."
18,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,Yet The Father is a powerful debut. The mood of isolation with its warped sense of time and the distanced characters confined to their homes: this film reflects our present moment without labouring the point home or making the obvious analogies.
19,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"This is a film of immeasurable power which everyone should experience once. It explores the frailties of being human, in a society which increasingly values youth over experience."
20,the_father_2021,audience,4.0,p,"A stellar acting from Anthony Hopkins and Olivier Coleman. The movie is in the perspective of the lead character ‘Anthony’ who is suffering from dementia. The main actor (Hopkins) perfectly depicts what a person goes through/feels when they are subjected to dementia. While watching the movie, viewers would also have hard time separating the reality (present) and memories (past) of Anthony as he mixes both of them up."
21,the_father_2021,audience,4.0,p,"A good movie, but the other one with Viggo Mortenson is more gritty and real - Falling"
22,the_father_2021,audience,4.5,p,"Hopkins has never been better than this, playing a fragile man fallen apart though dementia, The Father is a devastating look at what people go though entirely alone, even if they have people around them."
23,the_father_2021,audience,5.0,p,"Honestly one of the greatest movies I've seen. You experience what someone with Alzheimer's goes through on a daily basis. The cast was spectacular, Anthony Hopkins gives an amazing performance throughout the film you feel as if he actually has the disease. Truly a great film and does its job at spreading awareness."
24,the_father_2021,audience,5.0,p,Visually stunning. Clean work right here.
25,the_father_2021,audience,2.5,n,"An accurate yet depressing look at life as one gets old and loses touch with reality. Troubling look at the beauty of family commitment and the toll it takes on the loved ones. Not sure it is worth watching, unless you like sadness and emotional pain."
26,the_father_2021,audience,5.0,p,Fabulously sad. I almost walked out with PTSD - my Dad went through this with his own father - the parallels were scary!
27,the_father_2021,audience,2.0,n,"Talk about a true head spin, the setup felt like it should be there, but the camera work, and the circling dialogue, just put your head in a blender and hit the extreme button on the end of the machine."
28,the_father_2021,audience,5.0,p,Immersive and heartbreaking to say the least.
29,the_father_2021,audience,4.0,p,I appreciated being able to simultaneously empathize with and consider the perspective of both leads.

32,bloody_nose_empty_pockets,critics,fresh,p,A beautiful tribute to a pace of life fading already fading even before 2020 steamrolled over it.
33,bloody_nose_empty_pockets,critics,fresh,p,"If you're missing the pub, this film will either make you feel much better or much worse..."
34,bloody_nose_empty_pockets,critics,fresh,p,"Like a Cassavetes film, Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets is an experimental combination of documentary and fiction that favors characters and a sense of place over traditional story-telling."
35,bloody_nose_empty_pockets,critics,fresh,p,"Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets is as real as anything you're going to see, it's not important how you get there."
36,bloody_nose_empty_pockets,critics,fresh,p,The Ross brothers baked more into the story than you might think.
37,bloody_nose_empty_pockets,critics,fresh,p,"Less a snapshot of life on America's fringes than a bleary napkin doodle, Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets blurs the lines between fiction and fact to aptly intoxicating effect."
38,bloody_nose_empty_pockets,critics,fresh,p,The sense of the watering hole as a haven for lost souls - not to mention the threat of gentrification to civic space - couldn't be more vérité.
39,bloody_nose_empty_pockets,critics,fresh,p,"This may be a clever fiction but it's fascinating, comical, and dignified delve into the American underclass, nonetheless."
40,bloody_nose_empty_pockets,critics,fresh,p,It was a hoot.
41,bloody_nose_empty_pockets,critics,fresh,p,"This is a fascinating slice of Americana which reminded me of 70s movie-making, like John Huston's Fat City."
42,bloody_nose_empty_pockets,critics,fresh,p,"So yes. Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets is a documentary. Just because the reality and humanity it captures is heightened doesn't make it any less pure."
43,bloody_nose_empty_pockets,critics,fresh,p,A heady vérité portrait of Las Vegas dive bar the Roaring 20s.
44,bloody_nose_empty_pockets,critics,fresh,p,"A 100 per cent proof party movie, but depth-charged with something even more heady."
45,bloody_nose_empty_pockets,critics,fresh,p,Does an excellent job at capturing how a drinking haunt can both hasten someone's downfall and feel like the only thing that's holding them up.
46,bloody_nose_empty_pockets,critics,fresh,p,"...traces a bar's final bleary, belligerent, occasionally beautiful 24 hours."
47,bloody_nose_empty_pockets,critics,fresh,p,"It is a boozy, rollicking night as The Roaring 20's rings in its last call. The bar patrons do not want this night to end, and it is a feeling that you will likely end up sharing."
48,bloody_nose_empty_pockets,critics,fresh,p,"A tale of the end of an era, but one which uses smoke and mirrors at its heart"
49,bloody_nose_empty_pockets,critics,fresh,p,"An ingenious, unexpectedly poetic faux-doc experiment which proves no less truthful once its artifice becomes evident."
50,bloody_nose_empty_pockets,audience,5.0,p,"It doesn't give you anything for free, but draws you in and rewards paying attention to the subtleties of the interactions. For me it was a brilliant commentary on 'change' and a perfect film."
51,bloody_nose_empty_pockets,audience,3.0,p,"Bill Ross IV and Turner Ross may have created a new genre, but this version eventually wears out its welcome.  We have a documentary film that is casted, and at its best it's like any bar in America.  It's a slice of life that has some moments that make you scratch your head until you learn the entire story!  The less you know about this one going in the better, but after you watch it and read all about it.  I'm mixed.  Final Score: 5.7/10"
52,bloody_nose_empty_pockets,audience,0.5,n,"I must have missed something that other people didn't because I honestly feel like I wasted time that I will never regain by watching this.  This movie is a sad depiction of what many do or actually don't do, with their lives.  As they pontificate about the generational stereotypes, their philosophical beliefs fall flat.  What is heart-breaking is that this bar and these regulars have valid meaning to many of their lives, and yet, none of them have genuine care or concern for the other.  Although they spend so much time together, nobody really knows the other.  It is a great example of what NOT to do with your life."
53,miss_juneteenth,critics,fresh,p,"Beharie, who has always had a remarkable gravitas and intensity on the level of Regina King and Cynthia Erivo, is wonderful here. She carries director Channing Godfrey Peoples' debut film..."

55,miss_juneteenth,critics,fresh,p,"The film creates greater awareness about the significance of the Juneteenth holiday. And, that is very worth celebrating."
56,miss_juneteenth,critics,fresh,p,Peoples' infuses her mother-daughter drama with a specificity and nuance that makes Miss Juneteenth special.
57,miss_juneteenth,critics,fresh,p,Channing Godfrey Peoples' Miss Juneteenth is a beautiful exploration into the dreams we have for our children and the lengths we go to make sure they are realized.
58,miss_juneteenth,critics,fresh,p,"We instantly know everything about the characters, evoking a deep empathy."
59,miss_juneteenth,critics,fresh,p,Beharie and Chikaeze are wonderful in their scenes together.
60,miss_juneteenth,critics,fresh,p,"The film connects with this history [Juneteenth] in a story about Turquoise and Kai both learning that they were always phenomenal, without a poem, without a pageant, without men."
61,miss_juneteenth,critics,fresh,p,[This] authentic drama about an African American mother concerned for her daughter's future is rather emblematic of the community's constant struggle to establish a seat at the table.
62,miss_juneteenth,critics,fresh,p,"A bracing depiction of generational working class poverty, and a beautiful lesson in how easily plans fail when your options are this limited and the pathway to success this narrow"
63,miss_juneteenth,critics,fresh,p,One of the dynamic relationships to navigate is that of a Mother and Daughter. It is a bond like no other. Miss Juneteenth examines that bond intelligently and with raw honesty.
64,miss_juneteenth,critics,fresh,p,"All of the acting is of a high calibre, with Beharie the standout, bringing Turquoise to life not only in the moment but also in the context of her past experiences."
65,miss_juneteenth,critics,fresh,p,It's an interesting story about the idea of liberation.
66,miss_juneteenth,critics,fresh,p,Turquoise's lovely journey from misguided to triumphant is impressively unimpressed with surface appeal.
67,miss_juneteenth,critics,fresh,p,"A joyful observation of Black lives, timely in this moment of global protest against racial injustice."
68,miss_juneteenth,critics,fresh,p,"Carl Jung's claim that the greatest burden a child must bear is the unlived life of its parents is rigorously tested, and validated, by this perfectly formed heartbreaker from the debut director Channing Godfrey Peoples."
69,miss_juneteenth,critics,fresh,p,The film buzzes with life and sincere feeling. The performances resonate like a struck bell. But a few too many questions are left unasked.
70,miss_juneteenth,critics,rotten,n,"When Miss Juneteenth isn't trafficking in tropes, it's a history lesson, and not the entertaining kind where you forget you're actually learning; the textbook kind."
71,miss_juneteenth,critics,fresh,p,"Even though you know with near certainty where the plot is headed, the emotional payoff sneaks up on you."
72,miss_juneteenth,critics,fresh,p,"If there's any justice, we'll be hearing Beharie's name in the Oscar conversation soon."
73,miss_juneteenth,audience,2.5,n,It can pass a little time for you but not much more.
74,miss_juneteenth,audience,4.0,p,"Wry, heartwarming slice of (black) Americana about a young single mom who tries to groom her rebellious teenage daughter to win the hometown beauty pageant she had won, just before her daughter was born and derailed her life.

We don't often see the struggles of ""ordinary"" black working class women on the screen.  These are women who get knocked down and pick themselves up and get knocked down again and pick themselves up again."
75,miss_juneteenth,audience,5.0,p,I loved that the movie showed Turrquoise as a real person that remained true to herself. She did not let her past  deter her desire for success for herself and her daughter.
76,miss_juneteenth,audience,5.0,p,This was a really good moving. Characters totally believable and a storyline that’s very real. Surprisingly inspiring and heartfelt.
77,miss_juneteenth,audience,1.0,n,Poor acting- bad script.
78,miss_juneteenth,audience,3.0,p,"This had some good acting and some good moments, but it felt like it wasn't really sure what it wanted to be - a mother-daughter bonding movie, a pageant movie, or a movie about a young mother finding her confidence again. And so it all felt kind of underdeveloped?"
79,miss_juneteenth,audience,3.5,p,Ending is disappointingly ridiculous and it's a tad uneven but I really appreciated the authentic feeling of a place and culture.
80,miss_juneteenth,audience,3.0,p,"Overall, this is a touching drama film.  It is filled with fantastic and pleasing performances from both Nicole Beharie and Alexis Chikaeze.  The plot is also satisfying as we witness a mother only wanting the best for her child and the struggles of her trying to do so.  The pacing for the most part is pleasing, but the film certainly feels quite slow to begin with.  Thankfully, it picks up at a nice pace for the second and third act.  Some key moments were also predictable for me, which could differ to others - Walkden Entertainment"
81,miss_juneteenth,audience,4.5,p,"Miss Juneteenth doesn't waste a single moment of its oustanding narrative, - that, despite depicting old familiar themes, does so with a highly nuanced effort from writer-director Channing Godfrey Peoples - offering a talented ensemble, led by a strong turn from Nicole Beharie, enough material to convey a powerful message."

94,la_llorona_2019,critics,fresh,p,"In Bustamante's sophisticated storytelling, the real horror seethes and bubbles, be it ever so gradually, in the heart of darkness of a male monster-figure who is to blame for countless crimes against the Indigenous community."

Nominada en los Globos de Oro de 2021, es una película absorbente, inquietante y memorable con momentos de suspenso, pero es mucho más que una película de terror, con su tono político y su crítica social. La necesidad de que líderes corruptos y sanguinarios rindan cuentas y se haga justicia nunca se había reflejado de una forma tan satisfactoria como en esta película. Si no se puede en la vida real, que sea entonces en la ficción. Muy bien, Guatemala. ¡¡Que hagan un remake colombiano!!!"
106,la_llorona_2019,audience,2.0,n,It's more a political story than anything else. There is hardly anything supernatural about it. Very underwhelming.
107,la_llorona_2019,audience,1.5,n,"Many forced silly situations. Unscary, poor acted. It was subpar in all aspects. The story was not catchy and it allresumes at a woman screaming. I don't know what tomatoes saw unless it's some attachment to the legend. a 5/10 would have a big bias component"
108,la_llorona_2019,audience,4.0,p,"Producers have had there ups and downs with the conjuring universe. La Llorona shows a fascinating approach on a popular folklore tale. Aside from the overly cliche horror moments, this movie was everything viewers can come to expect."
109,la_llorona_2019,audience,5.0,p,Great movie about how the real horror is the genocide of indigenous people. A must watch!
110,la_llorona_2019,audience,3.0,p,"Going into this, you're probably expecting a horror film and in some respects it is, which I suppose is the point. What I mean by that is whilst there are a few familiar horror elements here and there, they're just for effect; ‘La Llorona' is really a political drama that's a vehicle for the writers and director Jayro Bustamante to shine a light on a particularly terrible time in Guatemalan history (the Guatemalan genocide); a message to the audience that more than anything, the true horrors of this world are the actions of man. 

The main problem is that whilst it's trying to get its message across, it spends most of the time chronicling the lives of the perpetrators (whose characters are pretty straight-forward and not particularly interesting) and ignoring the victims almost entirely, which goes against what they were originally trying to achieve and weakens whatever they were trying to say significantly, despite a couple of powerful scenes.

The idea of rejigging and repurposing a well-known myth is interesting, but the fact remains that it's going to disappoint people expecting a particular type of film and getting a very different one. If you can get past that, there are some lovely visuals and the story (based on real history) is absolutely worth knowing, even if it's not nearly as effective as it could have been."
111,la_llorona_2019,audience,4.0,p,"8.25/10. Horror is used as an effective platform for explorations of human brutality, genocide, grief and revenge. Probably should have leaned harder in the supernatural spooks, but packs an essential message and is well crafted (particularly the sound design and cinematography)."
112,la_llorona_2019,audience,3.5,p,"Not the most chilling movie I've ever seen, but it's effective, if very slow. The thing that scared me the most was when they were listening to a TV newscast about how the Guatemalan government called the Guatemalan genocide a fight against communism. Welcome to the good ole US of A, where the same zealous rhetoric that has caused or excused genocide is being used to call anyone on the left a communist and an enemy of the people. Now THAT is scary. The topicality of that alone is enough to make this an effective film."

117,shirley_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The film is thrillingly unpredictable, not least because Elisabeth Moss is so volatile."
118,shirley_2020,critics,fresh,p,Moss and Stuhlbarg's performances are showstopping-ranging over a striking spectrum from muted passivity to explosive chaos-and are reminiscent of gripping theater.
119,shirley_2020,critics,rotten,n,Decker's film presents the psychosexual obsession...but the salacity feels perfunctory rather than passionate.
120,shirley_2020,critics,fresh,p,"A subjective and engaging character study that's daring, disarming, dark and, unsurprisingly, anchored by a pitch-perfect Moss."
121,shirley_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Shirley is a taut, engaging drama, which explores the intricacies of female relationships and roles in a considered, compelling - and stylish - manner."
122,shirley_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The proposal is... effective, although so much excess is at times unnecessary, especially when you have a very good actress and she's portraying a writer who is so fond of forcefulness and narrative clarity. [Full review in Spanish]"
123,shirley_2020,critics,fresh,p,[Josephine Decker] displays a mastery of the medium in a story that defies easy and precise articulation. Her portrait of the creative process as an atmospheric thriller is subversively spooky in a way Shirley herself would approve.
124,shirley_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Shirleyis a psychosexual, theatrical piece buoyed by the magnetism of Moss and Stuhlbarg's loathsome performances, but sometimes at the expense of riveting drama."
125,shirley_2020,critics,rotten,n,"While it's clear that Shirley is supposed to be a type of psychological thriller, the way its story is told and the imagery used to tell it make it less than thrilling."
126,shirley_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Decker's distorted dream-like visual approach is often beautiful, as though we're looking through a psychological prism. It creates atmosphere but doesn't provide the thrills that Jackson herself might have infused into the telling of this tale."
127,shirley_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Shirley is an unadulterated delight, and it is not a prerequisite for you to have read or even heard about Shirley Jackson. This is a story for everyone."
128,shirley_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Shirley has far different aims than does the usual laundry-list biopic, but it's far, far more powerful for it."
129,shirley_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Despair, desire, and madness are all entangled in Josephine Decker's Shirley..."
130,shirley_2020,critics,rotten,n,"'Shirley' will likely pull decent enough numbers, but it feels like it wants to lean into its crazy solely by telling us about it rather than showing us."

132,shirley_2020,critics,rotten,n,"The look of the film is as lively as the story is sluggish. The acting, by the three main characters, however, is very strong. Overall, the story is not compelling, and the characters are unappealing."
133,shirley_2020,audience,4.0,p,"Interesting movie about two women, their relationship and creating fiction. Sometimes after watching a movie I find myself reading more information about it online and this was one of those movies. I think there was such vagueness and quite mysterious ending that I needed more information to clarify my thoughts. This was a weird movie too. Relationships between people were quite unusual and unclear. For example it wasn't obvious whether the marriage between the Shirley and her husband is good or bad and do they love each other or not. Also the relationship between Shirley and Rose is open for different interpretations. The whole movie is open for different interpretations. And hence, the vagueness. Which is, in my opinion, a good thing."

135,shirley_2020,audience,2.5,n,"Just to start, I don't understand that a movie focused in an author makes a spoiler of her most important tale; in fact, one in which the surprise in the end is fundamental.

Second, the story suffers the weight of the personality of the main character, which is of course the main point but also his penalty. It is problematic to reivindicate a badass character with no other intention to be badass."
136,shirley_2020,audience,5.0,p,"PLEASE DO YOURSELF A SOLID AND WATCH THIS FILM. 
Soak in every detail, every mannerism, and be open to being surprised. Best film I've seen in over a year on all levels."

138,shirley_2020,audience,4.0,p,"I'm not a huge Elizabeth Moss fan. I never got into Mad Men, I loved Top of the Lake season 1 but thought season 2 was heinous, and I quit watching The Handmaid's Tale after season 2. (None of that was her fault per se, but she didn't do anything to keep me watching either.) However, I was amazed that this film garnered zero Oscar buzz. Moss was phenomenal and the entire production far exceeded my expectations. This was really well done and highly recommended for fans who like quirky, sometimes completely uncomfortable dramas."

165,never_rarely_sometimes_always,audience,4.0,p,"""Never Rarely Sometimes Always"" is a completely riveting film experience about very real, sensitive problems women face, and is especially hard for a man to watch, but totally worth it. This film actually moved me.

168,never_rarely_sometimes_always,audience,5.0,p,"This is the movie to watch! Bitter-sweet. It is a harsh look at what it is to be a teen girl, but extraordinarily relatable and beautifully executed. It was so well-written, I recognized every character in this movie. Truly gorgeous. The two main actors give amazing performances."
169,never_rarely_sometimes_always,audience,4.0,p,A bit too much that every single male in this film is into sexual harassment but overall a very good one
170,never_rarely_sometimes_always,audience,3.5,p,A good exercise of independent cinema with hard moments and low ratio. 7/10
171,never_rarely_sometimes_always,audience,4.0,p,"Deeply moving without ever being sensationalised or playing to the gallery, this is a subtle and understated story of a teenager's long-distance trip to New York for an abortion. The scene from which the film takes its title - a series of questions asked of the central character about her relationships - is a masterpiece, simply focussing on her and her almost wordless reactions. Nothing else in the film quite matches up to that, but there's not much wrong with it either. Compassionate and humane."
172,never_rarely_sometimes_always,audience,3.5,p,"This is a film with an important plot, taking up an issue many young girls deal with around the world. Autumn is 18 and pretty much a typical, moody teenager. She finds out that she is pregnant and the race for an abortion is on. She must travel to other cities to get things done and along with her is the much more popular girl, Skylar - one of her few friends.

The plot is serious, but it's done in a very plesant way. Never graphic, supersad or painful to watch. It's almost educational in the way it's presented and I would say it's a film to be watched for young teenage boys and girls. Eliza Hittman is quite a fresh director and she brings Sidney Flanigan to the screen, the protagonist. She is very impressive here and there is no doubt that this should be her breaktrough.
Good film that got some well deserved hype.

7.5 out of 10 trimesters."

Very unique and is a good example of an independent film that really capitalized on the filmmakers vision. Some of the scenes were riveting while there were a few that felt a little predictable and didn't match the flow of the rest of the film. Was very surprised how much I felt during this film. The ending was a very satisfying knot on top of the rest of the film. The main thing that I noticed during this film is how authentic and uncut it felt. It really worked in the movies favor and I could feel the pink adolescent coming of age vibes throughout the film. Also a lot of the humor landed fairly well here. This is totally a sleeper film and one I think people who enjoy adolescent dark comedies needs to see."

Not a comfort film - the queer protagonist was in heartbreaking situations for the majority of the film. But the story is ultimately hopeful.

Conservative Georgians were outraged that the central love story involves 2 people of the same gender, completely missing the point of a forbidden romance. The fantastic acting is bolstered by a sensitive script that might feel meandering at times, but it mostly keeps focus on the 2 leads and how their lives change dramatically over the course of the film. It demonstrates not only how strong human emotions can be, but also how much a person can express themselves through the medium of dance, not saying a single word, instead allowing the movements of their bodies to tell a story. It doesn't quite have Brokeback's rewatchability, but there's truly a lot to admire in the Directors vision and in the tale he worked hard to tell. A very underappreciated movie that deserves a lot more recognition, and a lot more fans."
25,and_then_we_danced,audience,4.5,p,"Sweden's entry for last year's best foreign language film is a Georgian (country not state) picture that is one of the most sensual love stories in recent memory.  This is a slow burn and as the tension rises so does the passion.  This film has been done many ways, but there's something different here. Incorporating dance didn't feel forced, but rather organic and it takes away part of the problem from a screenplay that is a little light.  The key here is the forbidden love of two people whose affection so clearly comes across on screen.  This is shot with such a sense of emotion in large part thanks to the close ups that are held longer than we're cultured to.  The emotional build leads to a powerful third act.  While this film is a fairly standard gay romance, it broke ground in Georgia.  I really enjoyed this and it isn't my typical cup of tea.  That music, wow!  Final Score: 8.8/10"

48,jumbo_2021,critics,rotten,n,"Yet unfortunately, there are just too many jumps to make and spaces to fill to fully believe this fantastical obsession."
49,jumbo_2021,critics,fresh,p,Merlant is divine in the leading role and her surprisingly touching connection with a piece of machinery - as ridiculous as it sounds - is one of the most captivating and moving onscreen relationships in recent memory.
50,jumbo_2021,audience,2.5,n,"Jeanne is a withdrawn and shy woman who works in an amusement park, yet has not yet come to terms with being an adult. Has she been in love before? Does she have plans of leaving the home of her mother? And why is she so fascinated by lights and carousels?

However, she soon falls in love with a newcomer to her place of work. Spoilers on, but in case you didn't guess, she falls in love with Jumbo, the new ride at the park.



Remember when that dude wanted to sleep with Airwolf? Yeah, that's a real thing. Objectophilia is when you go beyond simply enjoying objects and begin to have deep attachments to them. The kind of attachment that makes you want to make love to them. I mean, if you clean a ride and it begins to make sounds and blink, obviously it is returning your affections.

This is one of those movies that asks that you make this narrative leap with the film. Can you accept the love between human and object? If so, then you'll be rewarded by what follows. And if not, well, maybe a more traditional love story is something you should watch.

Jumbo attempts to explain why Jeanne feels the way she does. But can any of us really explain love? Why does the heart want what the heart wants, even if it's to lick the oil of our lover off the floor and communicate in beeps and lights? Maybe those noises and colors are a closer tie than most of our inter-human coupling have anyways.

So yeah, when Jeanne's mom Margarette wants her to find a really nice guy, maybe she didn't consider that a Tilt-A-Whirl would be that man. Guess who's coming to dinner? Hope you like food on a stick, I guess.

This is writer/director Zoé Wittock's first full-length feature. I feel that this has enough ideas to work as a short, but you can't fault that she went for it. Here's hoping for more bright lights and beeps in her future."
51,jumbo_2021,audience,1.0,n,I hated this movie and it's hard attempts to be cutesy and quirky.  Basically 90 minutes of a whiny brat with a bad haircut throwing tantrums because no one understands her feelings for this ride.  No thanks.
52,jumbo_2021,audience,4.5,p,"Great and unexpected modern fairytale ! Crazy pitch and surprising take on it, this is a heartfelt movie that will take you on a ride to remember. I laughed and I cried. Thank you for the experience. A must see of 2020 !"
53,jumbo_2021,audience,3.5,p,"Jumbo tells a very unique story with a great lead performance. Noémie Merlant was absolutely great here. She proved herself with Portrait of a Lady on Fire, and shows yet again how talented she is. I would love for her to breakout in the mainstream. The film tells its love story between woman and machine a lot more conventionally than I thought. But there is some great imagery courtesy of director Zoé Wittock. The film has great pacing and keeps you invested. The ending didn’t really feel well earned, but other than that I thought this was a very solid film. Overall, I really liked this. It tells a good story and is well acted and well directed. I also think this might work as a metaphor but I won’t delve into that due to spoilers. I definitely recommend checking this out."

61,high_tide_2020,critics,fresh,p,"High Tide makes us keenly aware of these variously intersecting identities, using a beautifully constructed house as the setting for a miniature treatise on class warfare."
62,high_tide_2020,critics,rotten,n,"Its premise, execution, and even setting registers as a clumsy way to depict an everyday horror experienced by countless women."
63,high_tide_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Chen shows off her skills as a filmmaker by the way she constantly reinvents Laura's relationship to her surroundings, namely the house where the vast majority of the narrative takes place."
64,high_tide_2020,critics,fresh,p,"It's an intriguing film, which will wrong-foot anyone looking for a moral compass with which to navigate the story, although the knotty complexity of issues and themes unravels slightly with an unexpectedly lurid denouement."
65,high_tide_2020,critics,fresh,p,Chen gifts actress Gloria Carras a stellar platform to navigate a slippery struggle for power and control amidst the frivolous parameters of the privileged.
66,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Funny, sad, thoughtful, endearing, it's one of those movies that gets everything right. Yes, it's an astutely observed insight to the immigrant experience in 1980s USA, but it's also just a great movie about human beings being awesome."

89,minari,audience,5.0,p,"This movie hits hard in a good way. Minari is a really inspiring film about a Korean family who move from California to Arkansas to farm. Packed with gorgeous cinematography, and endless emotions it is a truly stunning achivement. I love how it shows what Korean life can be like on a farm in Arkansas, where the house is a raised mobile home, the film potrays this so well and just the event of moving. Movie also deals with sickness and loss in a beautiful detail. I defiently reccomend Minari."
90,minari,audience,4.5,p,Should have won best picture 9/10
91,minari,audience,4.0,p,The best Korean movie.
92,minari,audience,4.5,p,"This is a semi authobiographical film of Director Chung's upbringing.  A story about immigration and starting life in the United States, it rings true to it's present day as a Korean family plops onto an Arkansas farm.  It is modest and specific.  It presents childhood as authentic.  There is perhaps no film more American than this, despite it being almost entirely in Korean."
93,minari,audience,4.0,p,"When they say movies are a window into the lives of characters, or story or a peek into history, Minari is such a film. Image starting a life with limited resources, but dreaming big, in a place that doesn't dream big? Would you survive, or would you give up to fit in? Now, watch Minari, and you'll appreciate this simple tale of the family comes first storyline."
94,minari,audience,3.0,p,"Minari is great. It builds on lofty ideals to execute a deeply personal view of both a family, some characters, and the world they inhabit. It's devoid of most of the things you'd expect from a film with such lofty ambitions. It trades forward-thinking cultural commentary for a much more subtle, much more modest view of family, togetherness, and accepting things as they come. 

Some say that this film represents an American dream. And I think it's better to say that this is an American tragedy; those who have seen the film will likely agree. But those little tragedies that fill every life lead to a fulfilling whole. That whole is filled with life, all joys and problems combined into an ugly mess of something. What that ""something"" is will be unique to everyone, but this ""something"" exemplifies the uniqueness of so many different people.

Okay, that's lovely, poetic talk. But this doesn't explain why the film is great. And in a lot of ways, it's premise is its downfall. It is modest almost to a fault. It's so diligently exploring this one, tiny example of reality that it really takes the power of the entire film to carry it across the finish line. While the score is and directing is fantastic, the drama on display simple and stern, and the overall execution fine, it definitely feels like a film that is doing its best to wrap up into a cohesive whole. It stumbles, very similarly to the family in the story; Minari can be very unclean, and obtuse at times. You might be looking for that meaning the film is obviously trying to communicate, but it can seem elusive, as if the film is trying to hide itself from you as a viewer.

But this film is for the climax. The film may meander throughout its second act, but its third act is a beacon, really grabbing you as a viewer and captivating you with the excellent performances of the actors. It's able to wrap up all its themes in fantastic fashion. Does that make up for its confusing arc, just because the conclusion is good? That's debatable. But you can't argue results, once you get to the end of everything.

In the end, Minari is a messy and confusing film, but one that is worth the time. It is certainly unique, and definitely hits the mark it was aiming for. The form may leave a lot to be desired, but the execution is all that matters."
95,minari,audience,5.0,p,"An arrestingly tranquil motion picture, that at the same time is as powerful as all the performances in it. Chungs' 2020 feature debut brims with bright sunshine and blue moonlight, a stunning look at the American dream."

98,i_carry_you_with_me,critics,fresh,p,"[I Carry You with Me is] an affecting story of a journey of discovery. But to borrow a metaphor from the chef's-tale part of its plot, it may have bitten off more than it can comfortably chew."

102,i_carry_you_with_me,critics,fresh,p,"An unforgettable memoir reminiscent of Chloé Zhao's slice-of-life filmmaking, blending actors with non-actors to tell a love story based on real people and actual events."
103,i_carry_you_with_me,critics,fresh,p,"[Heidi Ewing's] made a movie to savor, for foodies and romantics alike, a portrait of the American dream where unconditional love is the light that shows you the way home, no matter how hard that road can be."
104,i_carry_you_with_me,critics,fresh,p,"The overall feeling here is ethereal, dreamy, moody, memory-like -- a more user-friendly Terence Malick vibe. It is a gorgeous film, and one that deserves to be seen on a giant screen."

113,i_carry_you_with_me,critics,fresh,p,A genre-bending hybrid that nails both the triumph of these two enterprising individuals and the acute sense of loss they experience as men without a country.
114,i_carry_you_with_me,critics,fresh,p,"Admirable efforts aside, I Carry You With Me is still an enchanting mix of drama and romance, but also a timely, poetic love letter to Iván's home country, Mexico"
115,i_carry_you_with_me,critics,fresh,p,"However many ways a story can be told for good, and by however many people, is worth trying. This film tries the telling at least a couple ways, and any audience would be better for lending their effort."
116,i_carry_you_with_me,audience,5.0,p,"This movie was fantastic. There are so many fantastic themes and storylines that are told within this film, and none of them feel superfluous. It's a beautiful piece about love, homosexuality, family dynamics, immigration, the American dream, and love of country.  The imagery paints a beautiful picture of Mexico, New York City, and the people who have chosen both as their home. I plan on rewatching this film soon, and I'll probably annoy my friends with how much I talk about this movie."
117,i_carry_you_with_me,audience,5.0,p,"A poem of a film, visually and in the narrators words....a love story, an immigarnt story..powerful and moving and relatable to anyone who has left the past and people and dreams behind.

118,i_carry_you_with_me,audience,5.0,p,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Sensitive, emotional and gripping, yet quiet, this film captures all that would likely happen in a relationship such as this.  Incredibility beautiful writing, this sounds at times like poetry and at others like a documentary.  Just outstanding!"
119,i_carry_you_with_me,audience,3.5,p,"A very honest & heartfelt film that’s worthy of the rave reviews, but I can’t help but think it would’ve been a better film with less flashbacks & less jumping around time frames. The confusion distracted from the sentiment"
120,i_carry_you_with_me,audience,3.5,p,Good story however the lighting in general was too dark in my opinion.
121,i_carry_you_with_me,audience,1.5,n,"Such great topics to expand on, yet Heidi chose to create very long and unnecessary scenes during the first part of the movie. Transition to real documentary was not smooth and confusing. Given that she didn’t go deeper on any of the topics, she could have told the story in less time. I did enjoy the music because I am Latina and know most of the songs. I also enjoyed the performance of whoever played Iván."

130,the_painter_and_the_thief,critics,fresh,p,The Painter and the Thief is a superb Norwegian documentary about a painter who befriended the criminal who stole two of her paintings. He then became her muse.
131,the_painter_and_the_thief,critics,fresh,p,"An almost uncomfortably intimate portrait of the strange vagaries of human need ... Like Kysilkova's paintings, The Painter and the Thief is photo-realistic but artfully constructed for maximum pathos, darkness and surprise."
132,the_painter_and_the_thief,critics,rotten,n,"The film can't make the case that the story, while unusual, is inherently interesting. Odd couples have existed since time immemorial, and Ree never illuminates these two people enough to make their stories worthy of a documentary."

145,the_painter_and_the_thief,critics,fresh,p,Benjamin Ree's intriguing documentary is an arresting portrait of the human connection... The Painter and the Thief paints the institutional failure of the criminal justice system while unfurling the pervading power of art.
146,the_painter_and_the_thief,audience,4.5,p,"Accompanied by the arresting painting talent from Barbora Kysilkova, Benjamin Ree presents a masterful work of passionate filmmaking, a fascinating film that is not only deeply touching, but also evoking and a study of the power of forgivness, as well as a analysis of the stranger than fiction bounds between human beings."
147,the_painter_and_the_thief,audience,5.0,p,This story did not go where I thought it was going.
148,the_painter_and_the_thief,audience,3.5,p,"The Painter and the Thief lost its steam in the second half, it lacked a bigger purpose and the runtime is too long, but the first half is excellent and the movie is fascinating in the titular complex psychosexual artist-muse relationship that was very well explored through many insightful and thematically rich conversations."
149,the_painter_and_the_thief,audience,4.5,p,"A well-crafted look at our weakness for destruction.  A backdoor, not unlike the one Milgram shone light on."

The film maker was completely invisible...made me wonder at times what was set-up / rehearsed and what was naturally occuring. In the end I didn't care too much about the process, I was so involved with the unfolding human drama. These are complex lives captured without judgement. I loved it."

154,the_painter_and_the_thief,audience,5.0,p,I didn't realise this film was a documentary till the credits came up at the end.  Blimey it took four years to shoot. Apart from that It was a brilliant film. The best script writer in the world could not have done better. Great camera work......and great personalities...Forget the word 'acting' as this was a true story unfolding infront of a camera.
155,the_painter_and_the_thief,audience,4.0,p,The movie is well worth watching. Her subject choice however....

157,wendy,critics,fresh,p,"An astonishing riff on Peter Pan, this film is both earthy and dreamy at the same time."
158,wendy,critics,fresh,p,"This is ambitious, wild filmmaking that pushes with childlike recklessness against the rigid bounds of literary adaptation: it doesn't always succeed, but when it does, everything feels -- just for a moment -- extraordinary."

161,wendy,critics,fresh,p,"While by no means perfect, Wendy ... has originality, folklore, and old-school Americana to recommend it."
162,wendy,critics,rotten,n,"Wendy is undoubtedly a well-intentioned attempt at re-dressing a classic story, but the narrative and performances often keep this version from taking flight."
163,wendy,critics,fresh,p,"Though the film starts off as a cliché-ridden redemption story, it gets more interesting as Smith quietly drifts into the background and his subjects' lives come into narrative focus."
164,wendy,critics,fresh,p,"I found myself pulled along, not only by Zeitlin's tugging showmanship, but the ache he manages to create around childhood as an enchanted space."
165,wendy,critics,fresh,p,It replaces JM Barrie's plot with its own melancholy take on growing old.
166,wendy,critics,rotten,n,A frustrating film which is full of good intentions but is marred by sloppy execution.
167,wendy,critics,fresh,p,Fans of innovative dramas should seek this film out.
168,wendy,critics,rotten,n,"It's a just-so vision of poverty, augmented by overly fussy, self-consciously yearning (and trailer-ready) narration."

172,wendy,critics,fresh,p,"Wendy is very much a work of atmospheria, sometimes maddening but with a style, a mood, a feeling impossible to shake."
173,wendy,critics,rotten,n,"A film that dabbles in the creative imagery of ""Peter Pan"" but loses control of its narrative for an uncertain target audience."
174,wendy,critics,rotten,n,I found myself wishing for a story less beholden to one we've seen brought to the screen so many times before.

I feel like it's sort of like "" Bridge to Terabithia"" a movie that's not really meant for any specific age group. So who is it actually for? To keep it short. I didn't like it. It's not even been a week and I forgot already if I quit right before the end or watched the whole thing."
177,wendy,audience,5.0,p,This was such a beautiful retelling of the Peter Pan story. Visually stunning and there could not have been a better cast actor for Peter - he was such a joy to watch. I will definitely watch this again in the future.
178,wendy,audience,1.0,n,"Wendy is a disappointing film. It is about Wendy who must fight to save her family, her freedom, and the joyous spirit of youth from the deadly peril of growing up. Devin France and Yashua Mack give horrible performances. The script is badly written. Benh Zeitlin did a terrible job directing this movie. I was not impressed with this motion picture."
179,wendy,audience,2.5,n,"The movie really tried too hard to be full of symbolism and deeper meanings. But really, it just turned into ""huh?"" and bad writing.   I kept waiting for everything to tie in together and get an ""aha!"" - but was just left wishing I didn't waste my time.

Good to watch if you are on a plane and want some noise. Not really good to take time out to watch with someone."
180,wendy,audience,1.0,n,I just didn't get it. Wendy is neither a good rendition of Peter Pan nor a new take on the popular character. This indie movie is weird and uncomfortable to watch.
181,wendy,audience,1.0,n,"Wendy is more like a reimagined adaptation of Lord of the Flies, with a girl."
182,wendy,audience,0.5,n,"Single dumbest thing I've ever seen. Bad plot, zero character development. Whoever made this movie, both doesn't understand human emotion and definitely knows nothing about movie making. I want the 2 hrs of my life back."
183,wendy,audience,4.5,p,A spectacular reimagining of Peter Pan. Made me tear up at the end.
184,wendy,audience,2.0,n,"Very strange! Beautiful scenery. Unbelievable, but it wasn't supposed to be believable. Seemed to drag on about in the middle and then got a little ""tied up"" and really didn't flow up until the end. I BELIEVE."
185,wendy,audience,4.0,p,I looked at all the Bad Reviews and gave it try anyway . Benh Zeitlen reminds me of Terrance Malik. The films are wonderfully shot and our beautiful to look at. You often wonder a bit about the storyline none the less you find yourself moved.
186,the_evening_hour,critics,fresh,p,"Lingering... rural elegy... As with King's documentary work and his first fiction feature, ""Here"" (2011), the stately glimpse of place and space express as much yearning as the most disappointed yet hopeful human heart..."
187,the_evening_hour,critics,rotten,n,"There is potential from director Braden King and the entire cast is game to take on their roles, but it all just doesn't come together."
188,the_evening_hour,critics,fresh,p,"King's touching, if muddled, drama succeeds at dignifying a subset of this country's working class."
189,the_evening_hour,critics,fresh,p,The Evening Hour is a thematically rich character study that succeeds despite uneven pacing and predictable storytelling.
190,the_evening_hour,critics,rotten,n,"The Evening Hour falls back on clichés, telling its story with a palpable sense of distance from the characters, from their struggles, and from the world they inhabit."
191,the_evening_hour,critics,fresh,p,"Something will have to give, and the beauty of the drama is that we're never sure what that might be until the very end."
192,the_evening_hour,critics,rotten,n,The movie opens and closes with appreciative pans of the verdant hills that suggest the heartland will live on. But what comes in the middle doesn't quite hold together.
193,the_evening_hour,critics,fresh,p,"Genuinely moving, captivating and nuanced with strong performances."
194,the_evening_hour,critics,rotten,n,"In spite of its strikingly lived-in sense of place, The Evening Hour's melodramatic storytelling works against that verisimilitude."
195,the_evening_hour,critics,fresh,p,"May lean into stereotypes of Appalachia and the lawless dead end many find themselves driving into. But King...humanizes the character ""types"" and the ""statistics"" to make one of the more compelling dramas set in this world and its struggles."
196,the_evening_hour,critics,fresh,p,"Lastly, director Braden King makes good use of his setting. He maintains the feels of an economically depressed Appalachian town, which is a character in and of itself."
197,the_evening_hour,critics,fresh,p,"The [well-realized] setting doesn't make up for a familiar storyline, the one where a guy riding the edge between legal and illegal finds he can't keep the balancing act going indefinitely."
198,the_evening_hour,critics,fresh,p,"Weighty stuff, and The Evening Hour handles it with agility and charm."
199,the_evening_hour,critics,fresh,p,"This is a drama full of effective performances, though Michael Trotter-who plays Reese, Cole's sometimes supplier-is the standout."
200,the_evening_hour,critics,rotten,n,This is one of those films in which people on the edge of poverty and battling addiction still look like they walked off a Hollywood set.
201,the_evening_hour,critics,fresh,p,Cole's moral turmoil is compelling throughout in this complex study of a character and the landscape that shaped him.
202,the_evening_hour,critics,fresh,p,"It's an atmospheric portrait which, while leaving several key story strands under-explored, does convey a vivid sense of the support system which powers and protects these lives lived on the periphery."
203,the_evening_hour,critics,fresh,p,"King clearly wants to do right by these people, but at a certain point his empathy begins to hurt the film as much as it helps it, leaving us with the unsolvable irony of a movie that rings true only when it goes off the rails."
204,the_evening_hour,critics,fresh,p,An unsensationalized look at moral compromise in opioid-era Appalachia.
205,the_evening_hour,critics,fresh,p,"This snapshot of life in a tapped-out Appalachian mining town holds the attention, even if it doesn't quite maximize potential as either melodrama or character piece."
206,the_evening_hour,audience,1.5,n,I watched this movie over two hours and never figured out what it was really about. That's not okay.
207,the_evening_hour,audience,3.5,p,"This is a real story about people, struggles, life, relationships, and dope. Set in the backdrop of what could be earthy West Virginia, we're taken right into the mildewed-smelling homes of a different culture. I think this is a rich film. The dope-trading heroes and demons are in a battle for the substrate of small, deep America. The acting is superb, but credit must be given to Cosmo Jarvis who seems to crawl right into a persona and delivers it completely. See this film."

9,the_climb_2020,critics,fresh,p,Covino and Martin find a cadence to their dialogue that perfectly props up the tension of cinematographer Zach Kuperstein's long takes that revel in awkward interactions and hard truths.
10,the_climb_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The Climb has a lot to say that's true to life, depicting jealousy and insecurities, idiotic power games, as well as genuine affection and moments that, unexpectedly, touch your heart. [Full review in Spanish]"
11,the_climb_2020,critics,fresh,p,Would've made my list of last year's best films had there been any way for me to have watched it without possibly killing my elderly relatives.
12,the_climb_2020,critics,rotten,n,The only thing I found unintentionally funny is Covino's heartfelt observations.
13,the_climb_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Originality is the real juice here. Covino and Marvin tackle friendship tales in unconventional, yet highly rewarding, ways that create organic comedy. It all hits hard."
14,the_climb_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Easily the best bromance flick since ""I Love You, Man,"" which is saying something."
15,the_climb_2020,critics,fresh,p,"With ""The Climb,"" director Michael Angelo Covino, who wrote the script with Kyle Marvin, breaks the mold with its wildly funny tracking shots, making us laugh even as we're marveling at the intricate technical skill required to pull off such shots."
16,the_climb_2020,critics,fresh,p,"For all the absurdist laughs (and not a few cringes) both men wring from it, their interplay feels both inherently ridiculous and entirely true to life; a bittersweet bromance writ in whiskey and spandex."
17,the_climb_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Overseeing a series of staggering unbroken takes, Kuperstein floats his camera alongside the characters as they encounter tricky terrain, both emotional and topographic."
18,the_climb_2020,critics,fresh,p,"There's a familiarity to a lot of the movie's material, but [Michael Angelo] Covino and [Kyle] Marvin make a notable impression as 'everyday guys' without being generic."
19,the_climb_2020,critics,rotten,n,"There are some laughs here, and there's some cinematic dexterity, but I soon found it all exhausting and exasperating."
20,the_climb_2020,audience,1.0,n,"I honestly don't understand the good reviews for this awful movie?  I was really looking forward to it and after the promising opening scene, ""The Climb"" went downhill fast.  Dull characters, an implausible and boring story, and poor pacing and direction make for a mess of a movie.  Avoid if possible or risk wasting your time."

22,the_climb_2020,audience,3.0,p,"This is a pretty unique movie about a lifelong friendship between Kyle and Mike, throughout many ups and downs and betrayals.  
The two leads are great in this, and this is dramatic, quirky and kind of awkwardly funny.  Surrounded by really good support, this is one of those hidden gems that you'll be glad you discovered."
23,the_climb_2020,audience,3.5,p,The camera-work's on point!
24,the_climb_2020,audience,5.0,p,"RATING: A  Director: Michael Angelo Covino
The Climb is a brilliant film about the ups and downs in a Male friendship. Michael Angelo Covino plays one of the two Leads alongside his real life best friend. The film is impeccably well crafted and the Screenplay really likes playing with this dark humour. The Cinematography is great and they often shot the Scenes in long takes with a single Camera that just keeps panning around. The Ending is brilliant. Definitely gonna watch it again."
25,the_climb_2020,audience,1.0,n,"a painfully slow, boring and unpleasant movie. just horrible. hard to figure the ratings. i disliked the 4 main characters except the idiot main character who merely bored and irritated me. i tried to find something nice to say about this but the only thing i can think of is ,""it could have been longer"". pointless boring garbage in all respects."
26,the_climb_2020,audience,5.0,p,"Funny, intelligent, original... really enjoyed this one!"
27,the_climb_2020,audience,2.0,n,"First time feature film makers Michael Angelo Covino and Kyle Marvin star as Mike and Kyle in a film that is as unfunny as it is predictable.  The premise of the film is interesting, but there's this goofy mental illness one of the characters has that is played for humor which is repulsive.  There's incredible sound design, so there's that.  Final Score: 3.8/10"
28,the_climb_2020,audience,4.0,p,A very realistic story of a toxic and unbreakable friendship.
29,the_climb_2020,audience,3.5,p,"Friendship can be a beautiful thing. Sometimes it can be painfully exasperating. And some other times it can be both, as this offbeat indie comedy shows in its exploration of a seemingly mismatched duo of longtime pals. Admittedly, this quirky exercise can sometimes be a little too analytical for its own good, resulting in some uneven pacing and overly talky sequences. However, when its inventive humor works, it's truly inspired, unlike anything viewers have probably ever seen. I just wish there were more of it. When writers Michael Angelo Covino and Kyle Marvin come up with ways to make a cycling trip, a funeral and an ice fishing expedition funny, you know these guys are onto something. It would have been great if they could have sustained such inventive lunacy more consistently, but I'll gladly take what they have given us, given that their bits brought out bigger laughs from me than from virtually any other comedy I have seen in some time. This duo is off to a great start with their debut feature, and I look forward to whatever they come up with next."

37,cuties,critics,fresh,p,"Cuties is serious and raises useful questions. If it makes you uncomfortable, it's supposed to."
38,cuties,critics,fresh,p,It's an excellent film I should say because it depicts the pain of childhood... I'm just going to say... I could understand the objections to was how these girls were shot because they are real girls.
39,cuties,critics,fresh,p,"Cuties is not a great film, but it is a sensitive and thought-provoking portrait."
40,cuties,critics,fresh,p,"Mean Girls without the Tina Fey silliness, or City of God without the violence...there's a lot to think about in this daring, somewhat-edgy slice of social commentary."
41,cuties,critics,fresh,p,"It is a movie that needs to be understood and watched, no matter how uncomfortable it makes you feel."
42,cuties,critics,rotten,n,"I appreciate what the movie was aiming for, and as a directorial debut...but I do think too much was going on and left up for interpretation. It was trying to juggle too many things."
43,cuties,critics,fresh,p,"I got the message behind it. This is a movie about coping, pain, the feeling of loneliness and what it pushes us to seek out...but the dubbing was pretty bad, with some of the voices not syncing up well..."

45,cuties,critics,fresh,p,"In both horrific scenes and adorable ones, what remains consistent is Doucouré's honesty."
46,cuties,critics,fresh,p,The film's portrayal of adolescent girls is spot on. The young performers perfectly capture the nastiness as well as the fickle changeability of girls whose identity depends on fleeting moments of approval and praise.
47,cuties,critics,fresh,p,... gradually loses strength and focus as it moves forward.
48,cuties,critics,fresh,p,Poignant drama is candid about tween sexuality; language.

53,cuties,audience,2.5,n,"Movie summary - parents, please pay attention to your kids.

I decided to give it a go to make up my own mind about the controversy. In a strange twist of fate, i am somehow with the critics on this one. it's a film critising sexualisation not glorifying it. the scenes shown are confronting yes, possibly even excessively so, but they make the point i think the filmmaker was going for.

it is a young girl's confusing journey to find belonging and struggling with different cultures and friends.

that being said this film was also a non-stop suffer fest that i wouldn't recommend to anyone."
54,cuties,audience,0.5,n,"I tried to be fair when watching this with all the politicizing, and form my own opinion. 
 However, in the end, it made me queezy and nauseous.  Seems they spent 99% of the time sexualizing young actresses, and the last few minutes trying to make it all okay.  Reminds me of a Lars von Trier, shock value for shock value, and grimy."
55,cuties,audience,0.5,n,"The sexualization of children is never okay, period."

60,the_truffle_hunters,critics,fresh,p,"The movie falls short of creating a singular argument, and the effect of its poetic visuals drifts off by the end. Still, it excels at diving into the essence of a business that's antithetical to modern-day supply and demand."
61,the_truffle_hunters,critics,fresh,p,"While I don't have a strong desire to sample the haute cuisine of white truffles, I do have an intense compulsion to wander around the countryside with Fiona, Titina, and Birba. Especially Birba."

65,the_truffle_hunters,critics,fresh,p,"Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw's documentary is a delightful, thoughtful film, which slows time down to take us into the hunters' mysterious world."
66,the_truffle_hunters,critics,fresh,p,"One of the best documentaries I've ever seen. Delightful in its simplicity and profound in its wisdom. Specific yet universal, it's an empathetic portrait of charming subjects. It's also really funny."

73,the_truffle_hunters,critics,fresh,p,A lovely film that's quietly profound.
74,the_truffle_hunters,critics,fresh,p,"The Truffle Hunters is slow but idyllic, with each shot looking like it could be framed and put on the wall of a photography exhibition. It really is a gem."
75,the_truffle_hunters,critics,fresh,p,"The Truffle Hunters is a real charmer of an Italian-language documentary about the old men in the forests of Piedmont who have spent their lives unearthing, with the help of their beloved dogs, the prized white Alba truffle."
76,the_truffle_hunters,critics,fresh,p,"It's a film, in the end, about mortality, culture and economics from a ""less is more"" philosophy that seems to document nothing while eventually capturing everything."
77,the_truffle_hunters,critics,fresh,p,The film simultaneously underlines its own artifice while inviting us to enjoy the delightful absurdity of a rarefied global culture based on the misadventures of eccentrics digging bits of fungus out of the ground.
78,the_truffle_hunters,critics,rotten,n,[The film is] sweet and pleasant ... but is told in an impressionistic fashion that actively avoids giving us a broader cultural context to weigh these truffle hunters against.
79,the_truffle_hunters,critics,fresh,p,A near-perfect documentary film for those who love Italian cuisine and dogs.
80,the_truffle_hunters,audience,5.0,p,"This film is art.  Absolutely joyous but super simple and quiet.  A study of humans. I think of Jacques Tati or Francis Ford Coppola, but quieter.  Incredible moments and the photography is pure genius.  100%"
81,the_truffle_hunters,audience,2.5,n,"We were excited for the hubby and wife date night doc, 'The Truffle Hunters', but it was a totally missable adventure.  If you speak ANY Italian don't watch with the subtitles as they are often incorrect and lag way behind.  This takes away from the beauty of the film because the story gets completely muddled in a mess of subtitles.  When conversations are happening and people watching can't figure out who's saying what you have a problem.  There's a better film in there, but this one needed a lot more work!  Hubby: 6.2/Wife: 3.2 (Only b/c it's shot in Italy) Average: 4.7/10"
82,the_truffle_hunters,audience,4.5,p,"This great film takes us deep into the heart of Piedmont's truffle country and truffle culture.  Most of the dialogue is in the local dialect, as we follow aging truffle hunters, their dogs, and the truffle merchants who buy and sell their product.  Wonderful, heartwarming."
83,the_truffle_hunters,audience,3.0,p,This documentary featured some eccentric characters that were interesting but seemed to be acting half the time. I don't know if they were supposed to represent the typical truffle hunter or not but the movie sort of dragged at times.
84,the_truffle_hunters,audience,2.0,n,"This is not a movie; so different I don't know how to rate it. More like sequences of video clips just put together. It does contain very beautiful scenery of Italy and if you watch it, you will learn a lot about truffles. Just very different."
85,the_truffle_hunters,audience,3.5,p,"This is a beautifully shot and composed film visually and sonically. Knowing the Piemonte I was already familiar with both truffle hunting and Italian eccentricity. So much of it rang true. However, the film falls uncomfortably between genres. It is not a documentary as billed as there is no context. Events just happen and the film follows several truffle hunters. Much or all of it appears staged. Yet there is no dramatic thrust either, leaving one wistful but unsatisfied. However, it contains many truths as it meanders along and is to a large degree authentic despite the stagey feel. Not for everyone though."
86,the_truffle_hunters,audience,3.5,p,"If subtitles aren’t for you, skip this one but the truffle market is shown well here. From the hunters to black market dealing on the street corners to the wealthy buyers at auction houses. I feel like the director had a good number of subjects on screen and their stories were displayed appropriately. But the dogs (hunters) steal the screen and the love from their owners, the old men of Italy who are a dying breed in and of themselves, is beyond apparent. Most of them single, see their dogs like wives, true loving relationships, with whom they spend all their time with on the truffle trail or indoors. Definitely recommend this film."
87,the_truffle_hunters,audience,2.0,n,"No substance. No story. Particularly uninformative for a documentary.

I was so excited to see this film after reading the premise, but I couldn't have been more disappointed as I walked out of the theater. 

If a film is to rely solely on beautiful imagery and lighting, the cinematography should at least be flawless. This was not. 

Some shots, or the length thereof, made me question their value to the audience. 

Sure, strapping a camera to a dog seems like a fun idea, but that footage really should have been pared down.

Skip this film and go enjoy a dish with truffles. It will be a much more rewarding experience."
88,the_truffle_hunters,audience,4.5,p,"If your idea of a great movie is car chases, comic book heroes, and explosions, this movie may not be for you.  ""The Truffle Hunters"" is more like standing in front of a great painting  or spending an afternoon at a wonderful art museum.  It has moments  that are as moving and as beautiful as anything I have seen this year."

93,the_last_shift,critics,fresh,p,"A wonderfully performed, if somewhat downbeat, portrait of the underbelly of the American Dream. It examines issues of white privilege, racial bias and how, despite the best of intentions, sometimes things just don't work out."

100,the_last_shift,critics,rotten,n,"It slowly devolves into something that resembles a failed sitcom pilot, with plot threads that are never fully developed and one thread late in the film that is so out of place it completely changes the tone of everything that proceeded it."
101,the_last_shift,critics,rotten,n,"Like fast food... gassy, not as nutritious as advertised, and in the end not at all filling."

103,the_last_shift,critics,fresh,p,Tells a story that feels real and lived in - something Hollywood often gets wrong.
104,the_last_shift,critics,rotten,n,"The Last Shift raises some intriguing questions that are ripe for exploration. Unfortunately, Cohn's film does not dive as deep as the topics warrant."
105,the_last_shift,critics,fresh,p,"Cohn's film excels in quiet, observational moments."
106,the_last_shift,critics,rotten,n,Trying to get a spark from a damp match is a lot harder than holding a flame to dry kindling.
107,the_last_shift,critics,fresh,p,"It would have been nice had the film given Jenkins a little more to work with, but the actor is more than up to the challenge."
108,the_last_shift,critics,rotten,n,"Less a comedy than a curio of vexing stereotypes in the BLM era, director Andrew Cohn's film is saved by Richard Jenkins and little else."
109,the_last_shift,critics,fresh,p,"It's another tour de force performance from Jenkins, in the same week as his headturning performance as the pater familias of a clan of grifters in Kajillionaire."
110,the_last_shift,audience,2.5,n,"A strange movie, but at times quite funny."
111,the_last_shift,audience,3.0,p,"Movies about fast food are generally watchable and able to keep the viewer focused, this was no different.  Solid all throughout with solid acting, but there is a hint of propaganda to it, be it deliberate or coincidental in one direction or the other.  The drawn out ending is kinda flat."
112,the_last_shift,audience,2.0,n,"Good acting, good directing, good production value, good editing, the dialogue was realistic, but boring. The overall story was just a boring yet realistic series of events, that added up to nothing. It's almost as if someone decided to combine Training Day and Clerks, but decided to do so on Opposite Day."
113,the_last_shift,audience,0.5,n,"Pure garbage.  A movie that really takes no stance at any point in the movie and leaves it open for strange interpretation.  Good acting, bad script and worse directing.  If you want to torture someone lock them in a room and put this on."
114,the_last_shift,audience,2.0,n,"Good themes, good umm....well that's about it for the goods. Slow and depressing, but if you can stomach the first act it gets a little more bearable in the second and third. Would not reccomend."
115,the_last_shift,audience,0.5,n,This movie is NOT a comedy! It's actually sad and upsetting and the plot has no depth at all; just a waste of time.
116,the_last_shift,audience,1.5,n,"Richard Jenkins is a outstanding performer, but The Last Shift gives him pretty much nothing to do than mubble his performance into a uninteresting whole of a depressing working man drama, that gets even dragged down by the unneccessary inclusion of the annoying performance by Shane Paul McGhie, whoes journey actually holds down the plot and Jenkins his own development, which would have been the only interesting thing to follow."
117,the_last_shift,audience,2.0,n,"It is a trash movie, I sat through it thinking okay stellar cast and production value might guarantee a quality movie, Would it surprise you to know that it is yet another movie that regurgitates the same political correct nonsense at expense to the plot and character dynamic ,so predictable and pretentious."
118,the_last_shift,audience,4.0,p,"Great performances.  Definitely low key movie theme.  But thought provoking story of people who work hard but still manage to scrape out an existence at a lower socioeconomic level.  Makes you think about how society pre-determines our expectations.  The final scene just lingers in my mind.  It is a quiet ""wow"" moment."
119,the_last_shift,audience,4.0,p,"I saw another Richard Jenkins movie in a day! He played old and quiet fast food sandwiches maker and he was great. Shane Paul McGhie played new employee guy and he was nice. Ed O'Neill (Modern Family) did nice supporting role. Movie was slow and really dark, but I felt it was good. Co-Executive Produced by Alexander Payne (Director of Election, Sideways)"
120,the_dissident,critics,fresh,p,"It unfolds like a well-told thriller and is absolutely damning in its portrait of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Not an easy watch, but a searing look at what led to the grisly murder of Khashoggi at his country's consulate in Turkey."
121,the_dissident,critics,fresh,p,"A disturbing, forensic quest for truth based on immense research, examining the life and political activities of the former insider who the opaque Saudi regime eliminated"
122,the_dissident,critics,rotten,n,"The definitive Khashoggi documentary has not yet been made. I could have just read this in an article, what a waste of all of our time."
123,the_dissident,critics,rotten,n,All the tackled political issues are dumbed down to fit a western binary of good and evil. The Arab Spring was great for the region but Saudi Arabia demolished it across the Middle East for fear it would encourage its own citizens to revolt.
124,the_dissident,critics,fresh,p,Equally chilling and moving.
125,the_dissident,critics,fresh,p,"It's an astonishing piece of work, both fearless and artful in the way it encompasses and orders layers of information. If our world needs new forms to encompass the complexity of modern life, The Dissident points a way forward."
126,the_dissident,critics,fresh,p,"Creatively, there are a couple decisions that didn't land. Overall I found it really interesting."
127,the_dissident,critics,fresh,p,"This hugely informative, superbly assembled documentary is designed to anger the viewer - and it does."

130,the_dissident,critics,fresh,p,"Propulsive, tense and extremely thorough, The Dissident feels like a worthy fit for a man who lived his life on the edge and devoted his existence to keeping people accurately informed."
131,the_dissident,critics,fresh,p,Powerful and disturbing. [Full review in Spanish]
132,the_dissident,critics,fresh,p,It leaves the viewer with a dismaying sense that world leaders may find the geopolitical price of justice for this particular dissident simply too high.
133,the_dissident,critics,fresh,p,"it is, in the defiant spirit of Khashoggi himself, utterly merciless in its critique of a brutal Saudi regime."
134,the_dissident,critics,fresh,p,The best thing about the documentary is that it restores Khashoggi to life...
135,the_dissident,critics,fresh,p,"I would've preferred a more somber tone...I'm not sure that's what this subject needed. Nevertheless, it's an engrossing and horrifying story."
136,the_dissident,critics,fresh,p,"...unsurprisingly hard-hitting, but it's the context for macro-scale geopolitics that The Dissident communicates so well. Despite some missteps and wasted frames in the visual execution, the contextual aspect is multiplicative."
137,the_dissident,critics,fresh,p,"The Dissident is a dispiriting and infuriating film to watch. And yet, it is also a compelling, engrossing and important document that simply needs to be seen."
138,the_dissident,critics,fresh,p,"As powerful as the film's account of Khashoggi's death is, the real energy of this documentary comes from the story line of a disciple of Khashoggi's, Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident forced to flee his country and seek asylum in Montreal."
139,the_dissident,critics,fresh,p,"This interplay of power structures: economic, political, technological, are fundamentally what journalism seeks to expose. It is perhaps The Dissident's most significant achievement that Khashoggi continues to do so even after his death."
140,the_dissident,audience,4.0,p,"A powerful and harrowing documentary which attempts to analyse the disappearance of Saudi journalise Jamal Khashoggi. Khasoggi entered the Saudi Arabian embassy in Istanbul on 2nd October 2018, and never reappeared. The feature includes an imposing array of talking heads, including the former director of the CIA, the head of the police in Istanbul, and in the second half of the documentary, Khashoggi's fiance, Hatice Cengiz takes centre stage as we follow her to various meetings and senate appearances. The film is terrifying, not just for the seemingly appalling actions of the Arab state, but for the use of hacking technology, most notably as we learn of the way in which various individuals close to Khashoggi were hacked, but also the way in which the Saudi government control the countries social media outlets. Compelling and worrying in equal measures, The Dissident is an exquisitely put together docu-drama, and well worth your time."
141,the_dissident,audience,3.0,p,"I'm going to be generous and give it a 3/5 instead of a 2.5/5. The detail about the murder and how Saudi Arabia operates was interesting, but the silly animations (e.g. bees vs flies), unreadable fonts, annoying walking shots, and non-chronological order significantly worsened the quality of the documentary as a whole. It jumped all over the place for no justifiable reason and would have been far more pleasant to watch if the events had been explained in a logical order. I also couldn't get over the silly bees vs flies discussion. With that said, the cinematography was sleek, the footage of Jamal was high quality, a decent number of people were interviewed, and the message deserves support. Lastly, the pacing wasn't terrible, but I do think things could have been cut down slightly more."
142,the_dissident,audience,3.0,p,"Extensive and comprehensive documentary on Jamal Khashoggi's murder,the perpetrators and the political motives behind it, although it still remains unclear why a regime would fear a single man so much that it reverts to such a hideous crime."
143,the_dissident,audience,5.0,p,"A brilliant piece of filmmaking from Bryan Fogel that outlines just how awful the regime in Saudi Arabia is at handling PR.  Geez, you're about to make a deal to make tons of cash and you put yourself on the radar.  Fogel does what he does.  He tell a story and does it in a way that captivates.  Even if you're familiar with  the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, you'll be horrified at what's been uncovered since the mainstream stopped following the case.  Final Score: 10/10"
144,the_dissident,audience,4.5,p,"The Dissident documents an assassination that you feel only belongs in spy thrillers. It doesn't hold back on a corrupt Saudi regime, while restoring Khashoggi to life. This is a call to action we all need to watch."
145,the_dissident,audience,3.0,p,"Butchering Dissidents

The Dissident is an overlong documentary about Saudi Arabia's cruel dismemberment of one of it's own, Jamal K. He was very happy to be an insider when the regime was killing people on an industrial scale, but grew a conscience. Then the new guy MBS decided he'd die gruesomely and use it as a test for Trump. Trump failed the test. It's very good, but who can pretend that the Saudis have not always been vile, backwards looking butchers? Three chopped off limbs for me,"
146,the_dissident,audience,4.5,p,"As much as we think we know about the gruesome, unimaginable murder and dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey, there's more that we don't, and it's even more shocking than we ever thought. Director Bryan Fogel's chilling documentary about the incident, what prompted it, and the fallout that has come from it -- both politically and personally for those who knew him -- is staggeringly infuriating. One can't help but wonder how those behind this killing could be so unspeakably cruel and cold-hearted, and all over differences in opinion and outlook about the scope of democracy in the writer's homeland. The film approaches this story from multiple angles, showing how they're interrelated and presenting them in a layered, progressive pattern that grows ever more damning and upsetting with each new revelation. This release is one that should make us all mad while we're watching it. How can we allow such acts to continue in this day and age? If we can't bring a halt to such atrocities, one can't help but wonder what kind of future we might all have."

150,the_forty_year_old_version,critics,fresh,p,"A a phenomenal directorial debut from Radha Blank who's also magnetic in front of the camera. It's rare to find a film that has such an authentic voice, so it's so refreshing to see one that has it in abundance."
151,the_forty_year_old_version,critics,fresh,p,"Radha Blank's arc embodies the theme of growth and experience, and shows that no matter how much time has passed in life, there's still plenty of room to grow, and make something of yourself."

164,the_forty_year_old_version,critics,fresh,p,The Forty-Year Old Version is an account of an artist's struggle but it isn't strictly an artist's story. It's universal tale of being true to one's self no matter the cost.

167,the_forty_year_old_version,critics,fresh,p,[It's] a comedic film that skillfully shows a mid-life crisis that has never before been portrayed on screen ... [It's] a semi-autobiographical movie that strikes the right balance of showing uncomfortable truths with whimsically raw comedy.

169,the_forty_year_old_version,critics,fresh,p,"This witty, effervescent romantic comedy is inventive, offbeat, and very funny. It is the kind of New York comedy Woody Allen might make if he was a black rapper."
170,the_forty_year_old_version,audience,5.0,p,"This movie is amazing. If you have the feeling that you are doing with your life, the exact opposite of what you think you should do, do not hesitate, this is your movie. It will help you to have compassion for your fragility, and at the same time it will give you strength to return to the path you like."

Amazing film that should be seen and not described, though the ""Puberty Porn"" Rap? Holy Crap, Radha. When ""Harlem Ave"" opens? I lost it. Watch this film to its end and you will be rewarded, and I can't help think what Lin-Manuel Miranda might think of the whole bit? 

Beautiful performances by the whole cast, and the music is fantastic. Oswin Benjamin as Radha's love interest is so smooth and gorgeous you'll be cheering for Radha to get it (and she does). 

I loved this film so much. Thank you Radha for making it. I hope Google fixes its SEO so when I type your film's name it doesn't take me to the Virgin next time, even though Google knows I typed in VERSION..."

You can tell how autobiographical this is, and how passionate she is in front of and behind the camera. The script is very well written. It’s filled with sharp and smart dialogue. The story mostly kept my interest. However, I do think the film is too long. It’s over two hours, and I think it could’ve been trimmed down. Also, I’m not sure why this is in black and white. The cinematography isn’t bad by any means, but I just don’t see why this couldn’t be in color. Overall, I liked this. Sure there are some flaws but this is a pretty unique and interesting film. I recommend checking it out."

14,timmy_failure_mistakes_were_made,critics,rotten,n,"There's a sequence about an hour in when ""Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made"" is briefly jolted from its hard-boiled slumber... More such scenes may have elevated it from simply being fodder for a streaming service."
15,timmy_failure_mistakes_were_made,critics,fresh,p,Timmy Failure: Mistake Were Made is a film that deals with themes such as abandonment and the difficulties of that change can bring while also demonstrating the importance of having hope and positivity.
16,timmy_failure_mistakes_were_made,critics,fresh,p,"It's a film both kids and adults can enjoy. The film is a heart-warming, and welcome change from Disney's other fare. It marks the beginning of a revival of Disney's creative storytelling that will hopefully be here to stay in the long run."
17,timmy_failure_mistakes_were_made,critics,rotten,n,"There isn't enough in the way of good jokes or clever references... to make the film appealing, and the flatness of Timmy's delivery, which is supposed to scan as deadpan, doesn't contain enough nuances to make much of the humor land."
18,timmy_failure_mistakes_were_made,critics,fresh,p,A meandering structure and a bit of repetition are immaterial concerns when a kid's movie is as fun and entertaining as this.
19,timmy_failure_mistakes_were_made,critics,rotten,n,"Sadly, Timmy himself proves oddly charmless, pathologically deluded, self-centred and heedless of the distress he causes others, not least his struggling single mother. We don't find out why he's like this, but the bear is amazing. Kids will love it."
20,timmy_failure_mistakes_were_made,audience,3.5,p,"An original live-action kids comedy that deals with serious issues from a warmly whimsical perspective, but not every positive message gets told, that should have."

23,timmy_failure_mistakes_were_made,audience,5.0,p,"A sweet, wonderful movie. During this tough time it's nice to a film with imagination and heart. This is not a film where a lot happens but you experience such joy watching the little boy and his imaginary polar bear.  I will treasure this film always."
24,timmy_failure_mistakes_were_made,audience,1.5,n,"""Timmy Failure"" is one of the few original movie offerings on Disney+ and it is among the worst I have seen on the platform. This movie is clearly aimed at kids, but I can't imagine kids would like it much because the story is bland and undeveloped. I think there was a lot of potential to explore deeper themes when the main character has such an overactive imagination, but they don't do much with it. I understand that the main character is supposed to be cute or charming, but I mostly found him to be kind of annoying. I completely empathized with the adults who were frustrated by his antics in the movie. Overall, the movie might be fine for really young audiences, but I can't imagine adults finding much value in this movie."
25,timmy_failure_mistakes_were_made,audience,2.0,n,"Forgettable.

'Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made' is, simply put, not very good. The execution of the plot is underwhelming, while the ultra dry nature of the humour becomes tiresome quickly. I was giving it the benefit of the doubt for the most part, with the expectation of a decent pay off at the end... but that doesn't arrive.

Winslow Fegley (brother of Oakes Fegley from 'Pete's Dragon') is alright in the lead, but the only cast member I'll remember is Craig Robinson - I, truly, liked his character, Mr. Jenkins. Ophelia Lovibond and Wallace Shawn are OK, I guess. I don't really have anything against the cast, to be honest.

It's just everything else that gives this film a low rating from me. I will say I do like a few aspects. For example, there's a cool CGI polar bear from start-to-finish, but it literally never does anything of note. I also get the message they were aiming for, but they don't quite get there. I did find the dialogue good, in parts, though.

It's harmless and, evidently, some will find enjoyment in this. For me, it isn't anything worth noting in terms of Disney releases."

28,timmy_failure_mistakes_were_made,audience,5.0,p,The greatest movie ever.
29,timmy_failure_mistakes_were_made,audience,3.0,p,"It teaches individualism and what it means to work and persistently strive in acceptable reality, within a favorably recognizable sightseeing tour for the amused local viewers, but it's stubbornly ridiculous and uncooperative despite the imaginative nature trying to be a Spock wannabe without a heartening attentive span to allow likable connection.

32,spree_2020,critics,fresh,p,Spree is the movie we've been subconsciously anticipating...a movie that confidently bridges the distance between old and new media without selling out either.
33,spree_2020,critics,fresh,p,Kotlyarenko is quickly becoming one of my favorite indie filmmakers.
34,spree_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Spree is a giddy adventure in screen maximalism, random violence, and cultural bitterness."
35,spree_2020,critics,fresh,p,Spree is a joyride through the sinister side effects of social media.
36,spree_2020,critics,fresh,p,Keery elevates the film beyond its relatively derivative narrative with a performance at once dangerous and completely unthreatening.
37,spree_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Not as smart as it could be, but an entertaining ride."
38,spree_2020,critics,fresh,p,Spree explores our interactions with technology within the intriguing confines of the found-footage format. Scream meets American Psycho slasher for the cyber age.

47,spree_2020,critics,fresh,p,"A slap in the face to the internet-based human race, but I think we kind of deserve it."
48,spree_2020,critics,fresh,p,A reduction as well as a simplification of what it could say about the subject matter ... but it's not all a waste thanks to a believably daft performance from Keery.
49,spree_2020,critics,rotten,n,A baseless thriller critiquing the social-media craze for being an addiction.
50,spree_2020,audience,4.5,p,Far superior to Creep. I found this great fun and highly original. The characters were great. Really worth watching.
51,spree_2020,audience,2.0,n,"For me personally, this was just gory and grotesque.  The thought that anyone would go on a killing spree leaving so many people dead is atrocious.  I don't appreciate the glorification of violence in this movie.  I realize it's just entertainment, but maybe it's me.  I'm not the person that I used to be.  I won't be watching this again."

I thoroughly enjoyed my time watching this movie, every area of modern life it explores is done perfectly and has genuine meaning.
It is funny in some places, serious in others and sad in some too.
I would highly recommend anyone reading this should try out Spree."

55,spree_2020,audience,3.5,p,"Pretty solid movie, surprisingly. Usually when I throw a ""I'm special because I hate what the kids like at the moment"" movie I go in with the assumption that it's going to be full of shitty repetitive takes, constant failed attempts to relate to younger audiences and a lack of understanding of internet culture overall. This movie however wasn't too bad. Perhaps due to the fact that the moment I hear ""social media"" or ""internet gaming"" brought up as a theme I go in with lower expectations. Joe Keery did a pretty good job playing the role of lonely wannabe famous incel and David Arquette also suited the role of C-tier celebrity DJ prick. The moment Jessie arrived on scene I knew she was going to do a terrible ""SOCIAL MEDIA IS BAD!"" take on stage, but I was happy to find that it wasn't as forced an overbearing as I thought. The best part about the movie for me was the chat reacting in the bottom left. Was good to see that they actually used some real emotes in there and not just the normie poggers shite you'd see in other movies, and some of the comments were genuinely hilarious. Overall I would say that this movie is good for its themes. But that isn't saying much. If you are going to make a film about social media being bad, say something original and hire younger writers, directors and set designers to make sure that your movie doesn't become a drinking game whereby people do a shot everytime they want to turn it off."

60,miss_americana,critics,fresh,p,Miss Americana is an intimate yet unintrusive look at the life of one of the entertainment industry's biggest stars.
61,miss_americana,critics,fresh,p,"It successfully humanises Swift without trying to convince you she is ""just like you"", giving you a glimpse of the pressure and impact of fame on a celebrity's health and voice."
62,miss_americana,critics,fresh,p,"While there are plenty of formulaic moments here, what is the docs' strength is the moment when the curtain is pulled down. When we actually get to see the person. Not just the celebrity or performer."
63,miss_americana,critics,fresh,p,"Makes an unbelievable world believable and an unfathomably successful artist seem surprisingly, well, likable."
64,miss_americana,critics,fresh,p,"Miss Americana transcends its subject matter and becomes a study of celebrity in modern America. Even if you're not a Taylor Swift fan, you'll be captivated by this glimpse into a universe populated by the ultra-famous."
65,miss_americana,critics,rotten,n,"While she undoubtedly gets candid in the film about many issues she's faced in her life, and it's ultimately a feel-good portrayal of [Taylor] Swift, the documentary (directed by Lana Wilson) has a lot of glaring omissions."
66,miss_americana,critics,fresh,p,"It humanizes Taylor Swift and gives us a peak behind her public persona, emphasizing the political ideas and motivations behind her creative process. [Full review in Spanish]"
67,miss_americana,critics,fresh,p,"We don't get 'gotcha' revelations because it's not a tell-all; rather, it's a bildungsroman."
68,miss_americana,critics,rotten,n,A lively but superficial portrait film of America's pop princess.
69,miss_americana,critics,fresh,p,Lana Wilson's cleverly controlled yet sincerely self-aware documentary about singer/songwriter Taylor Swift.
70,miss_americana,critics,fresh,p,"Those who ever doubted Swift's talent, smarts or conviction will find this chronicle eye-opening and extremely entertaining, especially when she's not singing or talking about music."
71,miss_americana,critics,fresh,p,"I think there this movie has a lot of interesting things to say about fame, interesting things to say about how women are conditioned to be good and be nice and not make waves and get the approval of other people."
72,miss_americana,critics,fresh,p,I came away with a whole new appreciation for one of the most famous people on the planet.
73,miss_americana,critics,fresh,p,"Will certainly appeal to Swifties, and will hopefully get those who are skeptical to think about her in a different light."
74,miss_americana,critics,fresh,p,It's a well-crafted work which reveals only as much as the camera-aware Swift chooses to reveal.
75,miss_americana,critics,fresh,p,"As a music documentary, Miss Americana is straightforward, celebrating Swift as a ferociously gifted writer and lyricist, and reminding viewers of just how industry-dominating she is."
76,miss_americana,critics,fresh,p,'Miss Americana' offers a compelling and compassionate portrait of an extraordinarily talented woman who has grown up and remained remarkably unspoiled under the harshest possible spotlights.
77,miss_americana,critics,fresh,p,"Going in a cynic, Swift - and Lane Wilson's film-making - won me over in the end. Bravo."
78,miss_americana,critics,fresh,p,"In the surprisingly thoughtful documentary ""Miss Americana,"" she has far more to say about it than just ""Flibberty Jib."""
79,miss_americana,critics,rotten,n,Wilson's film wants to sell us on her goodness rather than allowing it to shine through naturally which is a shame since it ultimately makes her seem even more like a product.
80,miss_americana,audience,3.5,p,"it's good but it's not the best documentary I've ever seen, great to show behind the scenes of a star who suffers from not positioning himself in politics until a certain year."

82,miss_americana,audience,5.0,p,I adore Taylor after watching it.
83,miss_americana,audience,3.0,p,I thought it might be elucidating for me to watch this since I actually have in no way followed this pop star's trajectory.  It was interesting for that purpose for me.
84,miss_americana,audience,4.5,p,"Wonderful documentary that shows us the life of a great and busy artist. At times very emotional, at others very joyful. A real eye-opener of how tough it can be, for famous people etc
The only thing that bothers me is the poster, which is terribly edited..."

86,miss_americana,audience,4.5,p,This film is truly one of the best documentaries surrounding a popular singer that has been released in a while. Audiences will truly get a glimpse into the personal struggles and prevails the talented singer has dealt with since her rise to fame. This combined with Swift's public outcry of the United States' political status is just the perfect combo for anyone to enjoy.

88,miss_americana,audience,5.0,p,"Raw and Real. The human side of the Taylor we've all come to adore.

A genuinely good documentary on a genuinely beautiful human being."

97,sylvies_love,critics,fresh,p,Every element does what it's supposed to: make the audience feel and swoon.
98,sylvies_love,critics,fresh,p,A stylishly moody period drama riffing on love and desire both romantic and professional.
99,sylvies_love,critics,fresh,p,I love Tessa Thompson and her portrayal of Sylvie.
100,sylvies_love,critics,fresh,p,"Like the great Douglas Sirk melodramas... ""Sylvie's Love"" is unabashedly sentimental and just gorgeous to behold - but the difference here is the terrific ensemble cast is primarily Black and Latinx."
101,sylvies_love,critics,fresh,p,"Sylvie's Love is a soaring, swooning, old-school throwback that's primarily concerned with wrapping the audience in a sumptuous cinematic blanket of jazz, ambition, and starry-eyed enchantment. And boy, does it ever."
102,sylvies_love,critics,rotten,n,"Despite Thompson's efforts, ""Sylvie's Love"" eventually collapses under too many plot mechanisms."
103,sylvies_love,critics,fresh,p,"Boy meets girl Girl and falls in love. If only it were this easy. While not so simple, Sylvie's Love is a love story taking place in turbulent times but not draped in trauma."
104,sylvies_love,critics,fresh,p,"It's resplendent & swoon-worthy, but there's something wanting. Somehow it lacks the depth I was expecting, but the two leads have a dazzling chemistry + there are enough here to keep you engaged in their romantic journey."
105,sylvies_love,critics,fresh,p,"During an age where Black love stories weren't told in this matter, it's great that we've arrived at a place where it can be done."
106,sylvies_love,critics,fresh,p,Sylvie's Love is a beautiful showcase for Thompson and a love letter to a vanished New York.
107,sylvies_love,critics,fresh,p,"It's wholesome without being saccharine and an excellent vehicle for both Thompson and Asomugha, who have perfect chemistry together."
108,sylvies_love,critics,fresh,p,"Making the love work is easier said than done, but as a film, Sylvie's Love is sweet sweet music."
109,sylvies_love,critics,fresh,p,"Melodramatic, old-fashioned romance has sex, mature themes."
110,sylvies_love,audience,2.5,n,"While the acting was awesome, the writing was subpar. I felt like I was waiting the entire movie for the real story to begin. It always felt like there was a really good movie happening just off camera.  It's really a shame because the actors were absolutely fantastic given the story they were telling."
111,sylvies_love,audience,2.5,n,Quite slow and old-fashioned plot (at first I thought the film was based on a novel from some decades ago but found that the story was newly written in current time). Felt no motivation and pretty bored.

116,sylvies_love,audience,5.0,p,it is so refreshing seeing black love without all the toxicity that the media loves to portray!
117,sylvies_love,audience,3.0,p,"The mood, the atmosphere. The wardrobe, the look. Sylvie's Love has all the visual pleasures one could want in a sixties-set romance, but it's entangled narrative goes through its motions without sparking near as much pleasure or joy as these other aspects. Tessa Thompson and Nnamdi Asomugha are cute enough, but never develop a relationship worth standing up for whereas Eugene Ashe's shot of jazz-fueled direction is unable to save a movie whose destination was always known and whose journey doesn't compel us to believe in it anyway."
118,sylvies_love,audience,5.0,p,"The most BEAUTIFUL movie of the year! Absolutely gorgeous. Truly a feast for the eyes, ears, and soul. Breathtaking performances from the cast. The color palette is stunning, and the musical score is a dream. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!"
119,sylvies_love,audience,3.5,p,"Sylvie's Love is an overly old-fashioned romance for better and for worse. The music subplot took way too much screen time and the movie is definitely favoring style over substance, but the two main actors are both charming, the tone is pleasantly lightweight and the romance is great. It's Douglas Sirk meets La La Land basically."

144,mucho_mucho_amor,audience,5.0,p,"Honestly, I had low expectations and just wanted to watch anything before going to bed. Didn't expect to be that uplifting. 
So after watching it, i had no regrets. No bad comments, no negative reviews, if there's any kind of poor execution in the development of this documentary, it was easy to not to notice it. I was easily caught in the story and also hooked by his personality and by what he means in latin America's culture, that even now I can see his legacy and started admiring him for the very first time. I wish I could have seen this before he died.. As a latina I take this documentary as an statement, and applaud Netflix for giving us the opportunity of having such kind of entertainment and for celebrating Walter's life with this film . It's a very rich and meaningful documentary mostly for minorities and that embraces diversity, in many cultures and across countries. I didn't expect this, and either to end up having a beatiful and positive message at the end of my day, now I will start my day with a different perspective."
145,mucho_mucho_amor,audience,3.5,p,"Walter Mercado is an inspiration.  He gives people hope.  This documentary on his life is a must-see, however I couldn't help but feel Mercado and people around him weren't always 100% honest.  This is an infomercial of Mercado's career and it's pretty good!  He is flamboyant and positive and you can't help but to be motivated from his words.  There is a celebrity who breaks down after meeting this man who is relatively unknown to English speaking Americans, but who is revered by the Latino American population.  His story rings a bell, but if you weren't into the astrological universe you probably won't know him.  I wish they talked about his sexuality or lack thereof in some way.  He's a fascinating figure, but I guarantee everyone who watches will have unanswered questions.  His message is love and this doc is one that's hard NOT to like.  Final Score: 6.8/10"

I didn't know he had died so recently, RIP Walter Mercado."

Growing up I remember watching him come on TV during Primer Impact and it was always an enjoyable moment. This documentary does a good job in presenting Walter in a humanistic way without bias. By the end of the documentary I was getting emotional and felt sad during his moments of hardship and death. I enjoyed this because it reminded me of my childhood. Even though I don't believe in astrology, I feel empathy for him because he was human like anyone else, and seemed to have a good heart."

169,worth,critics,rotten,n,"Hardly without value, but it leaves you with a nagging feeling that it should be much more emotionally wrenching than it is."
170,worth,audience,3.0,p,"This movie is straight identity politics propaganda....


As the reviewer noted, the movie spends much of its time centering around listening to people's stories of what happened that day. If you're paying attention closely, you can see that the overarching theme of the movie is that we must listen to people's ""lived experiences"", and that laws must be rewritten, and policies changed, to accommodate the needs of people who aren't covered by the status quo. This parallels the messages we are being bombarded with today by woke activists, pushing their views about proactive discrimination, intersectionality, white male privilege, ""doing the work"",  etc.


In this movie, the 9/11 Victims Fund played the role of White Supremacy- it unintentionally was ignorant to the needs of those marginalized. Our protagonist (Keaton) played the oblivious, rich white male with privilege that needed to ""do the work"" to understand that the system doesn't work for people 'not like him', and therefore the rules needed to be bent to bring justice for all (on this idea, the message is fairly out and obvious, and yet clearly overlooked by so many reviewers)

Very clever subliminal propaganda delivered through a mediocre Netflix drama, with an above average cast."
171,worth,audience,0.5,n,The movie felt more like an American propaganda pic and reminded me of Pearl Harbour - in terms of trying to stir a fake sense of patriotism or in this case calm the public and get them to feel that what was being done was in their best interest when it clearly is not. I don't know but something about it felt rotten - as if it was trying to make it easier to convince current or future victims to accept deals they shouldn't accept because apparently too many Americans have accepted deals in the past that were obviously unfair and should've been refused out of principle. Change will never come this way. And the same holds true for this movie - it felt like going backwards in time - just not in a good way.
172,worth,audience,3.5,p,"We live in such a complex world and when life is involved, we cannot be averaged out by an algorithm. Humanity is the outlier not always guided by rational thoughts, especially when money and emotions play a factor. The wealth disparities are laid bare when trying to cost out a janitor and a CEO in the same formula. Stanley Tucci yet again steals the show, sorry Batman."
173,worth,audience,2.0,n,Not what I was expecting. Now I knew it would be depressing but I did not think the acting would be so subdued. Boring and predictable.
174,worth,audience,3.5,p,"A well meaning and somewhat successful story about the lawyer fighting for the rights of the 9/11 survivors and their families.  One of the nations biggest tragedies continues to hurt those close to it years later.  This story is a great rallying cry to bring justice and compensate those who suffered at ground zero.  I wish the film wasn't quite so stagey.  What comes out as good and vital, could have been great and vital.  Still this is a worthy film with a story well worth telling."

176,worth,audience,3.0,p,"For a film given such lacklustre marketing, 'Worth' is worthy of seeking out purely for the relevant story and Keaton's engrossing performance as a lawyer tasked with the impossible."
177,worth,audience,4.5,p,I've never reviewed a movie but I felt compelled to rate this one. Very powerful storyline and performance from Michael Keaton.
178,worth,audience,4.0,p,"Worth is an extremely effective piece of storytelling. Complex, nuanced drama that tackles big subjects with grace and intelligence. In short the title comes from the idea of 'What is a life worth?', in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. It's the true story of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. Michael Keaton stars as lawyer Kenneth Feinberg, who is appointed to head up the fund. The fund is designed to compensate the families of 9/11 victims, rather than them engaging in costly and possibly unsuccessful lawsuits. He has 2 years to convince 80% to accept the offers on the table. He also has the difficult task on placing a value on each victim's lives. Of course the drama here is between the dry calculations of the law and the open and painful feelings of the victims' families. It makes for delicate and substantial conversation as the film peers into the lives of enormous tragedy. What makes the film so effective is that it goes about its business with grace and humility. There aren't many moments of grandstanding, but rather a quiet accumulation of stories of pain. Keaton and Stanley Tucci are perfectly suited to ther lead roles. Their experience and pathos add gravitas to each scene they are in. It makes for a very impressive film, a film of effortlessly great acting and succinct and empathetic writing."

198,boys_state,critics,fresh,p,"The experience is perfectly setting these kids up for what American democracy is -- it's about winning and losing, your party's success... Boys State, as a chronicle of this experience, accurately then also focuses on winning and losing."

205,boys_state,audience,2.5,n,"The film quality was great and they did a good job with the flow of editing. However, I’m not entirely sure what I’m supposed to do with this film. I mean what do you expect will happen when you allow 1,200 17 year old boys run a government. The filmmakers did have bias in the sense of attempting to make you feel bad for the left leaning candidate and painting all the conservatives in a negative light. Am I supposed to be surprised? Disappointed? Motivated? Other than allowing the viewer an inside look at the program, what was the point?"
206,boys_state,audience,3.5,p,"An interesting documentary on Apple TV+ about 1200 seventeen year olds Texan boys who came to the Boys State event to build a hypothetical government from scratch. 

Now as unique as the plot sound, the story actually reflected a lot about what was happening in modern politics. The boys were separated into two parties, and the voting process was similar to one in the US. The boys discussed a lot about common issues, as well as using political tactics that were seen before. Since this is Texas, many of the boys were conservative and one of the biggest topics was gun control. The speeches made by the boys were also similar to those real life political campaign speeches. 

For me, I dislike politics and cannot stand campaign speeches for how generic they all are. So throughout the movie was usually bored at the issues that the boys discussed, as well as the speeches, except for one. One of them made a very good speech that actually convinced me. 

Toward the end, the movie definitely got better as more drama appeared and things spiced up. That was when the movie got me really hooked up to see who would win as the governor. 

Overall, an interesting documentary that showed a lot of how some young Americans view politics, and these boys might become the future of politics. 7.5/10"

I remember the media excitement of at the start of the project, and the later media criticism (typical of the shit attacks, conspiracy theories, and misinformation you find on social media these days).   It was an amazing thing, an incredible accomplishment, marvelous construction and engineering, and didn't deserve the kicking it got.  

The movie  was frankly a bit boring.  I did other work while the thing played in the background.   I didn't watch the ending, since I already knew how it came out."
22,spaceship_earth_2020,audience,3.5,p,"Spaceship Earth sheds light on a little known, but fascinating real-life project named Biosphere 2. Although it rarely deals with the science behind this experiment, the movie delves deeper into the psychology behind it in that very good second half.

25,spaceship_earth_2020,audience,3.0,p,"The experiment itself I found tremendously captivating, even without all the later affairs that added all the spice to its story and even though there were, to my understanding, nothing scientific about it (""trendy environmental entertainment"", as some called it in the archived footage). But this movie seems, let us say, biased as to what kind of portrayal of the ""Bioshpere 2"" it would like to present to its audience. Suffice it to say that nearly no one outside of John Allen's little inner circle of self-proclaimed geniuses was interviewed here, and certainly no one form the scientific community. It is quite sad that many documentaries that suppose to educate audiences about interesting real-life events and topics make no actual effort to consult with the specialists in related fields (the same can be said about ""The Tiger King""). This is the reason why I cannot realy recommend this to anyone who is not likely to buy Allen's and his friends's weird theatrics and crazy stories about how intelligent and important they were all those years ago."

Tremendous documentary by David France that shows us the actions of the NGO Russian LGTB Network.

A strong complaint about the discriminatory, repressive and criminal policy of the Chechen government against its LGBTQ population, involving their families as repressive agents, in a country whose president, the confessed homophobe Kadyrov, has the explicit support of Putin.

53,welcome_to_chechnya,audience,4.5,p,"Documentarian David France chronicles the anti-gay purges in Chechnya during the late 2010s. LGBT Chechen refugees with the help of hidden cameras give the viewer an inside look at how they get out of Russia through a network of safehouses aided by activists who are trying to shed light on the human rights abuses in Chechnya.  The faces in the film are not real, but they are computer generated because they would not be safe if recognized.  This story should be on national news every day until queer people stop being killed for no reason.  This is a very tough watch and a break or two may be needed just to wrap your mind around what you just saw.  Final Score: 9/10"
54,welcome_to_chechnya,audience,4.0,p,"""Welcome to Chechnya"" documents the persecution of gay men and lesbian women in Chechnya, a republic of the Russian Federation. It follows the Moscow Community Center LGBT group and their efforts to shelter gay people in danger, including ""Grisha"" (later revealed to be Maxim Lapunov), an event planner who is not even ethnically Chechnyan. The story is powerful, gripping, and tense, and at times hard to watch, especially when they intercut candid footage of gays being beat up."
55,welcome_to_chechnya,audience,4.0,p,"Welcome to Chechnya offers a tragic, intense and important look into the atrocious gay purges happening in this questionable region. The film needed to have more facts in it and it is overly modern in approach, but that still mostly worked as the thriller elements are successfully executed, many scenes here are very suspenseful and moving, and the movie's use of VFX is very strong and unique."

57,welcome_to_chechnya,audience,4.5,p,"Shocking, infuriating and extremely important. The cruelty experienced by Chechnya’s LGBT community should be known by all who care about human rights and dignity."
58,welcome_to_chechnya,audience,2.5,n,"It's hard to write a review because this is an important subject matter. But I think it was a very poorly made documentary for a very important subject. It was very traumatic to watch because of how it focused on certain very violent, graphic scenes, rather than presenting the subjects as people. I wanted to learn more about the victims, their lives, rather than being force fed horrific videos. Many of the videos should come with a warning - there is a scene of an attempted suicide with graphic video involving blood, there is a very very graphic scene showing a rape happening involving a man. This to me was very concerning, I don't believe this video would have been shown if it was a woman. What does this serve, to show these very graphic videos? There are so many graphic videos online of people being killed, or tortured to the point where it is almost ""porn"" to some people and it encourages desensitization and it is very traumatic to view for people who may have experienced these things or who are sensitive. There are no warnings when you watch the film however, so I am warning you now. I would have rather read about these issues than ever watch this film. I used to work for an international tribunal on genocide and war crimes so I am no stranger to reading about horrific things but I try to understand the issues rather than have graphic imagery being forcefed to me. I did make a donation to the center after watching the film. I hope to learn more about the stories about the people involved in the film from articles or a better made film in the future that doesn't try to reduce the people to graphic scenes. It reminds me of the American version of the movie Traffic that focused on violence and divisiveness versus the British series that actually captured the stories inclusively and explained the situation better."

67,scare_me,critics,fresh,p,"Aya Cash: So good in You're the Worst, so good in the most recent season of The Boys, and now so, so good in Scare Me, a horror-comedy that leans heavily on her ability to tell stories... but good."
68,scare_me,critics,fresh,p,"Despite some bagginess in the middle, each of the stories in this anthology-style horror are well-executed, providing creeps and laughs in near enough equal measure."
69,scare_me,critics,fresh,p,Scare Me understands the power of sound and the film's pared-back style gives its actors a chance to really play around and challenge themselves.
70,scare_me,critics,fresh,p,"more of a dark comedy than a full-bore horror tale, but genre fans will dig it all the same. the two leads are clearly having a good time, and it starts to infect the viewer."

80,scare_me,audience,2.0,n,"A wonderful concept of scripted collaborative story telling. With great acting from the two main characters, it's easy to get sucked into their little stories. That makes it extra unfortunate, though, that most of those stories aren't very original or exciting. After an hour and a half it starts overstaying its welcome. All in all mostly a wasted opportunity, but a very unique one."
81,scare_me,audience,4.0,p,"Really fun, definitely not scary but really worth watching. I did leave wondering which side of this drama is Director Josh Ruben on. Maybe we're all just complex being regardless of our skin colour or gender."

87,scare_me,audience,3.0,p,"This is the most Marmite film I've seen for a while. I think you probably have to judge this on it's own terms as an experimental genre piece.

On the up side, I will say that it kept me interested until the end, it was creatively made, very well acted, and genuinely quite entertaining in parts.

However, it does feel like several sketch pieces cobbled together. It's both hipster fodder and fan service. It's like it's trying to be some kind of theatre piece disguised in the body of a small horror film. You could almost describe this as an avant-garde horror anthology.

But actually I think I quite liked this for at least having the guts to take a slightly different spin on the horror genre and pop culture.

3 out of 5"
88,scare_me,audience,5.0,p,"I went into this movie not expecting much ( I mean c'mon- how exciting can a movie be about a couple of people sitting around a cabin with the power out telling scary stories be ? ) but I must say I was pleasantly surprised! Started out a little slow but very quickly had me feeling like I was right there in the cabin with them as well as laughing at the occasional witty banter back and forth. Very good cast, they all work very well together. Nice twist at the end. If you are looking for a very scary supernatural thriller or gorefest this may not be the movie for you, but if you are into horror comedy check it out- you will be very glad you did!"
89,scare_me,audience,3.5,p,"Aya Cash steals every part of this film. Between this and The Boys, her star is clearly on the rise. Whippy dialogue, creative storytelling and a claustrophobic setting make this standard horror fare taste a little sweeter than similar ""scary story"" films. 7/10"
90,uncle_frank_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Uncle Frank holds a good balance of being both a character piece and a well-paced kitchen sink drama, with all the hall-marks of a master screenwright at its helm."
91,uncle_frank_2020,critics,fresh,p,That it's so touching is a testament to Bettany's performance.
92,uncle_frank_2020,critics,fresh,p,Given its subject matter and its myriad supporting characters - and some of the wonderful actors who inhabit them - Uncle Frank feels like it could have been a more-robust affair.
93,uncle_frank_2020,critics,rotten,n,"Uncle Frank, written and directed by Alan Ball, is clearly a drama, but it hides the true depths of its drama for much of the film."
94,uncle_frank_2020,critics,rotten,n,"Alan Ball's Uncle Frank is rife with potential, but in rushing the catharsis it fails to engage the viewer, and Frank remains as unknowable to us as he was in the beginning."
95,uncle_frank_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Uncle Frank looks good, has a nice enough script from Alan Ball, and a collective cast that makes it tolerable."
96,uncle_frank_2020,critics,rotten,n,"Uncle Frank wears its heart on its sleeve, and that works for a while. Yet, as the movie goes on, it becomes so sweet and saccharine, you just wind up with a toothache."
97,uncle_frank_2020,critics,fresh,p,"If you're into Sleepy Time Down South cliches, it goes down like that first mint julep of spring - refreshing and redolent of a time thankfully past, but for all its ugliness, formative in ways that only passing years make clear."
98,uncle_frank_2020,critics,fresh,p,Bettany doesn't just try to understand Frank; you can read the character all across his face. It's first class nuance that hits harder in the end.
99,uncle_frank_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The end result is a film that is softly moving, immensely charming and bittersweetly emotive. Such a delight."
100,uncle_frank_2020,critics,fresh,p,The surprise highlight of the film is Frank's lover Wally (Peter Macdissi) who wants more family so much that he's willing to risk much more than even Frank. Get Out & Proud!
101,uncle_frank_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The relationship between Frank and Wally exists so beautifully within this film, I wish I could just watch a movie about them together without the contrivances of Frank's family drama."
102,uncle_frank_2020,critics,fresh,p,"While a bit too melodramatic at times, it never does so incorrectly, just the style of filmmaking it's going for. Still, Uncle Frank hits you right in the feels and never lets up."
103,uncle_frank_2020,critics,rotten,n,"Following many detours, there's little gas left by the time we arrive at the all-too-convenient conclusion."
104,uncle_frank_2020,critics,rotten,n,"The writer/director's peculiar misunderstanding of his audience, and penchant for clichéd characters makes a hash of what would be a strong, lead performance from Bettany, a wonderful actor, long regulated to the sidelines."
105,uncle_frank_2020,critics,fresh,p,"...it is expertly done, with a fine performance from the reliable, underrated Bettany keeping things emotionally grounded."
106,uncle_frank_2020,critics,fresh,p,"At times too broad and at others too maudlin-which is to say, quintessentially Alan Ball-Uncle Frank is a welcome twist on the coming out film"
107,uncle_frank_2020,critics,fresh,p,"There are solid points along the way, and it's beautifully played by a terrific cast."
108,uncle_frank_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Macdissi's funny, warm and emotionally authentic Wally is crucial to the film's successful aspects."
109,uncle_frank_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Uncle Frank is a lot of things - part family drama, part road movie, part coming out story - but it manages to largely avoid becoming the muddle that such a wide-ranging collection of distinctions might indicate."
110,uncle_frank_2020,audience,4.0,p,"""Uncle Frank"" is a sweet addition to the LGBT film library. Set primarily in 1973, the film depicts the life of a closeted gay man named Frank Bledsoe, who grew up in rural South Carolina but moved to New York City, where he found a job as an associate professor at NYU and considerably more personal freedom. When his niece, Beth, leaves SC to attend NYU, she learns her uncle's secret and meets his ""roommate"" of more than 10 years, Wally. Beth and Uncle Frank are pulled back to South Carolina when Frank's domineering and conservative father passes away. Wally tags along uninvited and the entire family eventually learns about Frank's sexual orientation via a line in the bitter father's will disinheriting his gay son in explicit terms. In the end, most of the family accepts Frank for what he is in their own southern way. That may be a little optimistic for the south in the 1970s but nevertheless proves satisfying. The cast is great from top-to-bottom, led by Paul Bettany as Frank and Sophia Lillis as Beth. (Lillis couldn't look anything more like a young Amy Adams.) Is this the best film ever made? Surely not. But it's a surprisingly tender and satisfying one."
111,uncle_frank_2020,audience,5.0,p,"Powerful, heart warming, great acting. One of the best movies I've seen this year 10/10 on prime"
112,uncle_frank_2020,audience,3.5,p,A sweet story of people discovering themselves and others.  Some good acting and scenery.
113,uncle_frank_2020,audience,5.0,p,Betanny's performance is the movie.
114,uncle_frank_2020,audience,3.0,p,"That's a great performance by Paul Bettany. But I'm pretty used to that from him. Sophia Lillis is wonderful also, again. Strong work as usual, also, from Root, Martindale, and Greer. Zahn was convincing as Mike as he walked that line between good ol' boy meathead and being a better man; one of more strength and tolerance than the father. 
There's some issues with dialogue I had, and Macdissi is a bit much at times. the 8'364th time a movie or tv show has had some scene with a person(s) being caught doing something extremely private that could be shocking, potentially devastating, with the door left open. Who the hell has sex in their parent's house with the bedroom door open? It's lazy writing.

123,collective_2020,critics,fresh,p,Collective is absolutely essential viewing.

127,collective_2020,critics,fresh,p,It's simultaneously scary and infuriating to realize that people who are paid to guarantee a proper functionality of a health system don't give a damn if you live or die.

130,collective_2020,critics,fresh,p,...a sporadically interesting yet terminally unfocused documentary in dire need of streamlining.
131,collective_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The film elicits a series of gasps, as one shocking revelation leads to another, and another."
132,collective_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Horrific footage of the inferno casts an eerie light as Nanau's film begins, and, with a surgeon's precision, he peels away the scab hiding an immoral national health-care system at home, one that had been secretly festering for a decade."
133,collective_2020,critics,fresh,p,"A dramatisation is bound to happen, likely as a Spotlight-style Hollywood movie starring a well-known name, but it'll never be able to match the power of seeing and hearing these appalling real-life horrors."
134,collective_2020,critics,fresh,p,"A very fine example of as-it-happens documentary-making, director/cinematographer Alexander Nanau is there as the journalists peel back the putrid layers of mismanagement, including a thankfully brief shot of an open would crawling with maggots."
135,collective_2020,critics,fresh,p,"If the film were merely a hymn to the everyday heroism of the press, it would risk becoming one-dimensional... So it's a good thing Nanau gives some space to a couple of memorable figures who represent different sides of the story."
136,collective_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Collective is eye-opening, elegiac, and essential. It suggests, or at least hopes, that the only thing more powerful than political corruption is the collective voice of those trying to stop it."

140,collective_2020,audience,4.5,p,"I am not a Romanian national and I wasn't familiar at all with this tragedy, in my country we also struggle with corruption, I think it should get the classification of ""pandemic"" given the amount of people and countries all of the world that suffer with it, but some situations even for today's standards seem harder to believe compared to others.

An horrific accident that took place on a Romanian club, involving a fire that killed several people ended up exposing one of the worst cases of corruption of modern time in Romania, from adulterated and overpriced disinfectants, to doctors and hospital managers being bribed to keep their mouths shuts and burning victims with no so serious wounds being killed simply because of lack of conditions, it's as unbelievable as it seems.

Politics is indeed an element of this movie, and politics is always a sensitive and divisive topic - sure they discuss parties and which one was in power when this happened and part of the movie is viewed from the perspective of the Minister of Health that took over, but I believe we should take aside this while watching the film, because politics will always make people suspicious and thinking that the politicians simply wish to protect their own agenda (a lot of times might be true but on others not so much, it's an inglorious profession).

I think that what should be taken from this sad and tragic story is that we the people shouldn't simply sit and watch, we should question and rebel when the common good is compromised, and also not less important, we should praise what I call real journalism, these individuals risk their lives when they expose these dark truths, they take their profession to a whole other level and they have the courage to represent what real journalists look like, not those cheap imitations we see everyday on our sensationalists national channels, the ones doing the hard and dirty job that keeps us all away from the dark."
141,collective_2020,audience,4.5,p,"An electrifying and groundbreaking documentary, Collective is a chilling reminder of the underhanded dealings of modern politics. Shot in a rigorously observational manner, Collective covers an event that took Eastern Europe by storm and led to massive big pharma and government reform. 

On October 30, 2015, a deadly fire in Colectiv, a popular nightclub in Bucharest, Romania killed 64 and injured 146. Of the 64 killed, 38 died in the hospitals. Upon closer inspection, it was discovered they were in close contact with some of the most resistant hospital bacteria on the continent, which festered in their uncleansed wounds. In the first part of the film, Catalin Tolontan's journalistic crusade is detailed, as he embarks upon a journey to uncover the negligence, corruption and political machinations that plagues the Romanian health system as a whole. Vlad Voiculescu is introduced as the new minister of health, and he looks to take Romania in a new direction for health and safety but faces massive backlash. Watch Collective to find out how this crisis is solved.

A widely-known Romanian journalist at the Gazeta Sporturilor, Catalin Tolontan, together with Vlad Vioculescu, ex-minister of health and patients rights activist, are featured in Collective. Tolontan colleagues Mirela Neag and Razvan Lutac are captured in the newsroom, printing papers and delivering fiery questions at press conferences. I especially enjoyed their portion of the film, possibly due to my interest in journalism, but also because of Tolontan's unique approach to tackling this case - calculated vehemence. Even Voiculescu's segment is intriguing, albeit a little more morose and harder to follow. Honestly, you can't help but feel bad for Voiculescu, the one upstanding politician who cares for people more than for the money in his pocket, especially in the tense election scenes. Tedy Ursuleanu, a burn victim, is also featured in this film. Her story is not illustrated in great detail, but featuring her is, to me, a massively positive step for Nanau to take. It adds a whole new level of ‘wow, this is real' to Collective.

The cinematography in this film is absolutely stunning; the camera team uses dimly lit, low contrast scenes to drive home the intensity of the incident and harshly lit closeups in telling the story of the people that Collective follows. The lack of ambient noise filtration in press conferences helps the viewer really jump into the story. Besides the plot, this has got to be my favorite part of the entire documentary.

Collective promotes freedom of speech, government transparency, and valuing lives over profit, which are all positive morals. There are political elements in this film as well as rather graphic scenes depicting burn victims, that you should be aware of. Also, there is some bad language and the whole plot is unsuitable for younger audiences. Nanau successfully calls viewers to action to speak out against corruption.

I give Collective 4.5 stars out of 5 and recommend it for ages 14 to 18, plus adults. Collective is in theaters and on-demand November 20, 2020."
142,collective_2020,audience,4.0,p,"A relevant issue how system polices the system itself, prevailing mutually assured corruption. Displaying almost inhuman levels of faceless cynicism, with no actual political grandstanding or ""experts"" talking directly into camera. This of course, doesn't prevent a certain part of the world to immediately project, long hauled corruption in the Eastern Europe onto their own dissatisfaction with their government, pretending it's the same thing because ""if it can't be about me, it might as well doesn't exist"". Good job America. What should be immensely admired is director's transparent insight into both news room and ministry cabinet, especially, when you consider the clash of interest this would cause, since it all was happening simultaneously."
143,collective_2020,audience,4.0,p,This documentary focuses mostly on a corruption scandal involving disinfectants sold to hospitals by a Romanian chemical company in the wake of a deadly club fire that led to protests and the fall of a government. It is very fly-on-the-wall without much background beyond the minimum but it is quite riveting and very interesting.
144,collective_2020,audience,5.0,p,Heartbreaking and insightful
145,collective_2020,audience,4.5,p,"Compelling investigation of corruption following a tragic fire in Romania but could easily have taken place in many countries including the Untied States.  Remember that journalists have uncovered many governmental and corporate crimes against us, we the people.  I have always enjoyed this theme from All the King's Men to Spotlight."
146,collective_2020,audience,4.0,p,"Collective shows how a government can prioritize money over the safety and health of its people and makes for an engaging, depressing, and memorable watch."
147,collective_2020,audience,5.0,p,Stunning expose of government when corrupted. Brilliant in every respect.
148,collective_2020,audience,5.0,p,"So proud of my country for this. The first romanian production to get nominated for the Oscars. I think it's well deserved, what happened back in 2015 in that club was terrible, but the worst part is after that, because our country and our government is corrupt to the core and people from the rest of the world should acknowledge the fact that Romania is a good country but it was ruined by it's weak and greedy politicians and their selfishness."
149,collective_2020,audience,5.0,p,An incredibly important film! Shows just how far and how damaging corruption reaches into everyday lives.

154,kajillionaire,critics,fresh,p,"Every minute of Kajillionaire, the latest quirky film from quirky filmmaker, actress, artist and writer Miranda July, is peculiar, specific, intentional and successful."
155,kajillionaire,critics,fresh,p,"Kajillionaire is a keenly empathetic look at kindness and intimacy, neglect and emotional violence, loneliness and trust, prettily packaged in brightly coloured absurdism."
156,kajillionaire,critics,fresh,p,"There are aspects of this film that remind me of 'The Royal Tenenbaums' with its dark, subversive humor, headed up by Richard Jenkins, who plays a perfect scoundrel. All four main characters are well fleshed out and quite quirky."
157,kajillionaire,critics,fresh,p,"It's rare for a film to feel so rich, so unique and so completely the sum of its parts, but July's third feature manages that feat."
158,kajillionaire,critics,fresh,p,"Kajillionaire gets at least a mild recommendation because it is so far from standard fare. In a world packed full of formulaic films, many of them reboots, sequels and prequels, this almost surely is one you haven't seen before."
159,kajillionaire,critics,fresh,p,Kajillionaire might be [Miranda July's] most accessible and rewarding film.

162,kajillionaire,critics,fresh,p,"Told with compassion, insight, nuance, and care,July's latest film is quick to steal your heart and win your love."
163,kajillionaire,critics,fresh,p,"The chemistry between Rodriguez and Wood is undeniable, and Rodriguez's more naturalistic performance balances out her costar's affected shuffling and deep, gravely monotone."
164,kajillionaire,critics,fresh,p,"Kajillionaire is about growing up, a painful, awkward, everyday love story, but no one tells it like Miranda July."
165,kajillionaire,critics,fresh,p,"Kajillionaire's unapologetic idiosyncrasy means your mileage may vary. But for me, it was a rumination on the complexities of parent-child relationships, on nurture, on how voids, once recognized, can always be filled."
166,kajillionaire,critics,rotten,n,Kajillionaire takes a heartbreaking story - a child of abuse trying to escape her sociopathic parents - and bloats it so full of Little Miss Sunshine kook that any emotional sharpness is left soft and doughy.
167,kajillionaire,critics,fresh,p,"Ultimately, Kajillionaire is an imperfect but a witty and enjoyable adventure with a character who feels like a misfit but will find her own way to grow."
168,kajillionaire,critics,fresh,p,"""Kajillionaire"" keeps getting sidetracked by its own offbeats, resulting in an experience that's equal parts endearing and exasperating."
169,kajillionaire,critics,fresh,p,"Kajillionaire is not a movie for the masses, but anyone looking for a different type of film with great acting could do a lot worse. July challenges the regular ways of telling a story, and she succeeds in making movies that are uniquely hers."

America has so trashed the American Dream. This movie sends a shaft of light in the growing nightmare, before finding a thin rope of American resilience and humour that shows there might possibly be a way up to a new horizon. Though don't hold your breathe! 

Richard Jenkins is always astonishing, btw!"
171,kajillionaire,audience,1.5,n,"Bizarre? Yes. Meandering? Definitely. Funny and worth the time? Nope. I don't care what Miranda July did before this. As a stand-alone movie, it's terrible."
172,kajillionaire,audience,0.5,n,Pure awful. What a waste of a terrific cast. Tries to copy successful quirky movies but apparently has no idea what made them work.
173,kajillionaire,audience,5.0,p,"Kajillionaire: El mundo está lleno de gente horrible. 

Hagan una pausa para pensarlo: el mundo está lleno de gente horrible. Nombres y rostros vienen a sus mentes porque, en lo objetivo o lo subjetivo, es una de esas cosas que tarde o temprano hay que aceptar.

Y esta peli dirigida por Miranda July es una forma de aceptarlo. Sin mostrar nada escandaloso, sin deleitarse en el morbo de lo cruel, Kajillionaire te trae la historia de Old Dolio, una chica de 26 años que junto a su padre y su madre se dedican a hacer estafas de poca monta que apenas les traen billetes para malgastar en sus paranoicas vidas de aves de rapiña.

Los padres, más allá de miserables, avaros y egoístas, tratan a su hija como basura, sin un solo gesto de cariño, demasiado perdidos en buscar la carroña para seguir sosteniendo su casi surrealista estilo de vida.

Lo bello de un filme como este es que conocemos a Old Dolio, interpretada por Evan Rachel Wood, en un momento de cambio, la vemos tratar de mirar más allá del mundo que conoce para comenzar a cuestionar su vida, sus costumbres, su adicción a una relación con unos padres para los que no es más que un instrumento en sus estafas.

De hecho, a nivel visual, la película no es, lo que se dice, un triunfo. Tiene lo suyo, sí, con colores apagados, momentos en que las luces resaltan a los personajes y tonos pastel que luego contrastan con momentos apagados. 

Y eso es porque el corazón de la película está en las interpretaciones de sus personajes. Tanto así que uno de los momentos más fuertes lo vivimos a oscuras, apenas notando unos puntitos, como si estuviéramos viendo el universo mientras un importante diálogo entre Wood y la actriz Gina Rodríguez nos muestra todo lo que necesitamos ver. 

A ratos incómoda, a ratos tierna, casi constantemente muy triste, Kajillionaire está llena de personajes reaccionando horriblemente a situaciones intensas que nos ayudan, como espectadores, a encontrarle cierta belleza a la vida. Y al lograrlo se vuelve una película muy sentimental, que quizá no convenza a algunos, pero que por su ejecución y actuación merece que le den una oportunidad o dos."
174,kajillionaire,audience,3.5,p,"Quirky film with interesting dynamics, some unique twists, and peculiar characters that carry it throughout."
175,kajillionaire,audience,0.5,n,Not funny and boring
176,kajillionaire,audience,3.5,p,"Spoilers: Petty thievery gone bonkers, as small-time crooks Richard, one of my favorites, and Debra have daughter Evan, in quite a committed, memorable role, do much of the heavy lifting in their locust-like pouncing on stuff of little value. At first we think deep-voiced Evan as Old Dolio, who does a lot of physical stunts, is all in on the parasite on the community routine. But we find her flat affect and willingness to go along with the program with verve suddenly morfs into expressions of deep-seated lack of fulfillment due to the almost comically criminal lifestyle that her anything but circumspect parents have abused her with. All that changes when Gina, bouncy and upbeat, shows up in a meet cute on a plane. The parents see her as a mark they can con into thinking she is part of their criminal gang, and finally steal everything from Gina's apartment. But Evan doesn't much like that approach, and finally sees Gina as not just her way out but someone who genuinely likes her and can provide some love and solace so lacking in her life. So the quirky, eccentric criminal gang that couldn't much shoot straight becomes a story of free Willy of the next generation. But the parents' parting shot on Evan, showing some real affection, is giving her gifts she returns for $550, exactly what she earned in the airport scam but never received. So while she and Gina are together at the end in a new and better life for both, the dough softens Evan's break with mom and dad just a bit. The daring creativity of July will dazzle critics but lose some seats in the theaters, etc., as the RT ratings show,"
177,kajillionaire,audience,0.5,n,Remarkably boring movie trying so hard to be creative and quirky. Lacked imagination and poor Wood just came off as wooden. If want to see the real Odlio watch the Point Lol. Now that was creative but I digress. This is a very silly waste of

185,thunder_force,critics,rotten,n,An action movie that never winds up being fun or exciting. [Full Review in Spanish]
186,thunder_force,critics,rotten,n,Thunder Force is dull and perfunctory and listless and altogether incredibly dismal.
187,thunder_force,critics,rotten,n,Many heroic abilities are on display - but cracking jokes isn't one of them.
188,thunder_force,critics,rotten,n,Can Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone just stop working together?
189,thunder_force,critics,rotten,n,Thunder Force is an absolute Thunder Farce - and not in any good way - and clearly has only been created to serve the minuscule talents of its leading lady.
190,thunder_force,critics,rotten,n,I really wish the joy McCarthy and Ben Falcone were having with their friends on the sets of these various movies would transfer over better to their films.
191,thunder_force,critics,rotten,n,"McCarthy has a recurring problem in her career, however: She keeps working with husband Ben Falcone."
192,thunder_force,critics,rotten,n,Thunder Force squanders a couple of interesting ideas and settles for half-hearted mediocrity.
193,thunder_force,critics,rotten,n,"The lameness of the set-up would matter less if the gags were even vaguely funny but, despite the capable performances, quips and pratfalls alike land with a deadening thud."
194,thunder_force,critics,rotten,n,The mere presence of Jason Bateman elevates this from being another totally awful collaboration between Falcone & McCarthy which only makes one recall how poor the comic instincts have been in the previous four. And this one too.
195,thunder_force,critics,rotten,n,"... more effective as a buddy comedy than a superhero saga, but its effort to combine the two feels labored and uneven. It's not funny enough to work as a genre send-up, and not clever enough to deliver the fanboy goods."
196,thunder_force,critics,rotten,n,Suffers from largely the same problem that all of the Ben Falcone/Melissa McCarthy films do which is that they're too bland--and with comedy that's generally not the winning formula.
197,thunder_force,critics,rotten,n,"Melissa McCarthy is a talented actress and also a funny one, but she keeps choosing projects that don't allow much of that to shine through."
198,thunder_force,critics,rotten,n,"McCarthy is obviously a very talented and funny person, but Thunder Force is a hollow vehicle for her skills."
199,thunder_force,critics,rotten,n,The movie wasn't funny. It wasn't exciting. It wasn't interesting.
200,thunder_force,audience,0.5,n,"One of the worst films I've ever watched, and I saw The Happytime Murders. It is literally a half-baked remake of The Heat. It's all low-brow humor & stupid McCarthy jokes. If you've seen one of her movies, you've seen the character she's playing. Two childhood friends grow apart and reconnect as adults. Both are exactly the same (her friend the over-achiever & McCarthy a lazy slob) and then they get super powers. There are so many more ways they could have explored this but they chose ""quiet girl is invisible"" and ""loud girl strong."" Wouldn't it have been more interesting if the childhood friends grew up to become opposites? Or what if the quiet girl got super strength and the loud obnoxious one was invisible? Nah, that might lead to the audience laughing & we can't have that."
201,thunder_force,audience,0.5,n,Ridiculous film that tries to be funny but falls flat

203,thunder_force,audience,1.0,n,"Two obese women out of supersize me try to be funny but have no good line to get there. At the rate obesity is rising in the US and in the UK, most movies will be featuring supersize actors if they don't want to be accused of not representing their viewers. Sad."
204,thunder_force,audience,1.5,n,"Featuring bad jokes, a poor plot and over-the-top performances, Thunder Force is one of those movies you'll be glad you didn't pay to watch."
205,thunder_force,audience,2.0,n,"McCarthy is more than capable of doing a buddy movie, as she proved in ""The Heat"" with Sandra Bullock, which made me cry with laughter. Oddly, it was the film's formulaic plot that somehow set them free to just have a blast, which we all felt. It was SO infectious. But this film? Oh, I'm so disappointed for all involved. I know she loves and supports her hubbie Ben, but they just shouldn't work together. He can't write well enough to make the most of her talents. I mean, when you've got even Jason Bateman falling flat, you've got real problems."
206,thunder_force,audience,1.0,n,An exercise in how to make an unlikable movie.
207,thunder_force,audience,0.5,n,i HATE melissa mccarthy
208,thunder_force,audience,0.5,n,The first 5 minutes were fine and then I hated every scene afterwards. HATED. Melissa McCarthy is aggressively unfunny and she has zero chemistry with Octavia Spencer. McCarthy is a horrible person throughout the movie and Octavia Spencer turns invisible and still hides behind shelves during a robbery. Not a single action scene was thought out and not a single joke was planned. They just rolled the camera and told audiences to deal with it.
209,thunder_force,audience,3.5,p,"Likeable and enjoyable, sometimes laugh out loud funny. Not for the fainthearted nerd who wants authenticity. Fantasy is meant to be different."

2,fantastic_four_2015,critics,rotten,n,"You've got to hand it to Josh Trank for making a movie that fails in almost every way. Fantastic Four is just frustrating because you can see hints of something interesting, but without the knowledge to build upon those ideas."
3,fantastic_four_2015,critics,rotten,n,What starts as a prime example of how not to construct an origins feature quickly turns into the perfect formula to avoid when making motion pictures in general.
4,fantastic_four_2015,critics,rotten,n,The film is such an obvious set up for more that it watches like they forgot to write anything but the beginning.
5,fantastic_four_2015,critics,rotten,n,The worst thing of all is the bad taste in the mouth that stays because the movie is nothing more than a mess introduced to desperation to try to give the public what a superhero movie is supposed to give you. [Full Review in Spanish]

8,fantastic_four_2015,critics,rotten,n,"Similar to the upcoming third reboot of the Spiderman franchise, this Fantastic Four reboot feels unnecessary. The story has not changed, nor has the dynamic of the group."
9,fantastic_four_2015,critics,rotten,n,"Fantastic Four is a radically different approach to the franchise. While this version of the characters may work out in the future, their establishment is anything but stimulating."
10,fantastic_four_2015,critics,rotten,n,"Fantastic Four won't leave you hungry for sequel; it will leave you desperate to forget what you just watched. Signs of greatness are there, but ultimately, this movie is little more than a mess and a crushing disappointment."
11,fantastic_four_2015,critics,rotten,n,"Fantastic in name alone, this film is far from it."
12,fantastic_four_2015,critics,rotten,n,Creaks and groans along for a mercifully short hour and 40 minutes while neglecting the basic fundamentals of storytelling in a surprisingly cavalier way.
13,fantastic_four_2015,critics,rotten,n,Fantastic Four sets itself well for a sequel if turned off well before the final act.
14,fantastic_four_2015,critics,rotten,n,It's an extremely rough film where there are a lot of edges that needed to be smoothed over.
15,fantastic_four_2015,critics,rotten,n,The story from start to finish was cliched and silly.
16,fantastic_four_2015,critics,rotten,n,"It takes itself too seriously, it's colorless visually and emotionally, and it dupes us by promising something ""Fantastic"" and instead delivering a lifeless black hole of an experience that'll ruin your day. There's no fun to be had here."
17,fantastic_four_2015,critics,rotten,n,It never reaches the glorious heights we have come to anticipate from Marvel's diverse universes.
18,fantastic_four_2015,critics,rotten,n,"Outside of the casting, which had such huge potential, and a few character moments that manage to land, Fantastic Four is a roundly inert and pedestrian affair."

26,fantastic_four_2015,audience,2.0,n,The first third of this movie was actually pretty solid. It's the extremely rushed middle to back and that just made this movie a absolute disaster. They set up so well but the execution of the end was somethings filmmaker strive not to do.

51,crow_the_city_of_angels,audience,0.5,n,Nothing really to deal with the Original man did this movie stink!
52,crow_the_city_of_angels,audience,3.5,p,"After having seen the glorious classic that was the first Crow movie, I wondered why anyone would want to make a sequel without the legend who died making the first film? Money. Always money and the way they were going to do that was by making another character become the Crow and repeat the same tale of revenge in the name of love. All things considered, it was not half bad but it could have been done better.

Years after the events of the first movie, Ashe Corven and his son Danny are murdered by a gang after having witnessed them committing a murder. The same divine power that resurrected Eric Draven to revenge upon his murder and that of his fiancé resurrects Ashe to avenge his son and his own murders. Helping him is Sarah Mohr, the friend of Eric Draven and Shelly, who witnessed her friend's resurrection and his revenge mission assists Ashe to obtain his revenge all the while growing close to him as his enemies pursue not just him but her as well.

I got to say it was going to take a lot to top the previous movie and I must say that it does not succeed but it does a fair attempt at doing so. Clearly, the filmmakers were motivated by fans to respect the previous movie, doing all that they could not exploit Brandon Lee or the previous storyteller. The film has a similar feel but at the same time giving it a different look. The acting is also plenty good. Vincent Perez does a splendid job as the Ashe Corven, the new Crow, making it clear that he is not a copy of Brandon Lee's Eric Draven by keeping the traits of the original comic book as well as the same quirks of insanity and power of his predecessor. But it is Mia Kirshner who delivers as the grown-up version of Sarah Mohr originally played by Rochelle Davis in the previous movie. Kirshner does a splendid job in creating a hauntingly lovely depiction of a young woman having endured a supernatural event motivated by love and loss and then grown up to experience it again. 

While I do believe the movie does stand well on its own, I have heard rumors that the writer and director planned something entirely different, a different style, and a hope to tell a grander epic than what was shown in theaters. A Pay-Per-View Director's Cut that is no longer available proves that as well as various clips and features that criticize the producers. If true then it makes me feel sad that something great was utterly lost. Life imitating art, I guess. I do not enjoy this movie as much as the previous film, but it is not without its beautiful and worthy moments."

84,bulletproof_monk,audience,4.0,p,"I saw the trailer for this movie in the theater and I was confused as to whether or not this was a comedy or action film. Seann William Scott is more known for his comedic roles than action. Whereas Chow Yun Fat is prolific for his action films. In the end, I was not convinced for years when I finally decided to take a look. Mostly it was because I liked Jamie King than either of the boys.  I got to admit it was a nice viewing.

A martial arts master passes on his power to an apprentice during World War II, when a power-mad Nazi hopes to steal this power. Years have passed as the apprentice, already a master intends to find a new apprentice. Chow Yun Fat is the martial artist and the apprentice is Sean William Scott. 

It is not that bad, but it is a basic martial arts movie with a comedic feel to it like Rush Hour but its not as funny. Still, it is not without its charm, particularly when Jaime King is involved in the story. With a nice surprise at the end.

It is a shame that this movie never got a sequel, it deserved one. Because it is a good movie."

88,bulletproof_monk,audience,2.0,n,I couldn't get into it.  It wasn't funny or entertaining enough to warrant any recommendation from me.
89,bulletproof_monk,audience,1.0,n,"Bulletproof Monk is a ridiculous, by-the-numbers action movie with silly dialogues and mediocre action sequences. This movie has aged poorly since it was released, with obvious green screen effects and unconvincing wire work. Movies like Crouching Tiger and Hero uses wire work to make action scenes more stylish as if characters are fighting in the air. In Bulletproof Monk, the wire work made the actors look like they're being manipulated by puppet strings. This is what happens when Hollywood attempts to make a wire-fu movie.

The acting was also mediocre, and even campy at times with the ridiculous and pointless ""Funktastic"" character. Yes, that's his name. The worst line uttered from his mouth was ""Lucky for you, this little bit of crumpet's come begging for some of my funktastic love"" after Jaime King's character embraced him from behind, telling him to stop fighting Seann William Scott. Writing partners Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris probably thought ""funktastic"" was the word that ""cool kids"" used back in 2003.

The action scenes weren't very good either. Not only were there a lot of fast cuts, but the shots were framed too close to the actors so you don't get to see much of the action. Action movies would often do this to hide inferior choreography, but Chow Yun-fat is capable of doing stunts. Why the movie failed to utilize his talent as a martial artist is beyond me.

There's not much to say about this film except it's a very forgettable, by-the-numbers action film. Everything that happens in the second and third act can be predicted well before the act even starts. The villain is a Nazi who acquires telekinesis in the third act, and only uses it once.

The movie has no self awareness at all. In this film, Tibetan monks are tasked to protect the scroll that grants the reader ""the power to control the world"" from Nazis, who want to use the scroll for genocide and wipe out all the race that they deemed inferior, whatever that race is because there's no mention of Jewish people.

If this was a Hong Kong movie, it would embrace the ridiculousness of the film. But when The Monk (played by Chow Yun-fat) shares his wisdom and philosophy with Seann William Scott, it feels like you're supposed to take the movie seriously. But how do you take the movie seriously when the big question is ""Why do hot dogs come in packages of 10, while hot dog buns comes in packages of just eight?""?

Overall, Bulletproof Monk is a terrible movie. Chow Yun-fat kicks ass in the film, and looked amazingly cool when he was on top of a car wielding two pistols, but the writing was awful, the action scenes were lame, and the cast lacked chemistry. You're better off watching The Matrix or Crouching Tiger again. And with juvenile humour, Bulletproof Monk is a kung-fu movie for teenagers."

97,green_lantern,critics,rotten,n,"Green Lantern's light faded for me, and was out completely by the time the final credits rolled."
98,green_lantern,critics,rotten,n,Green Lantern is as cheesy and has more plot holes and dangling story strings than a piece of 70's macrame.
99,green_lantern,critics,rotten,n,"The film never rises above a screenplay that seems to be pulling in several directions, leaving the material battling with tone and consistency. The result is a lifeless attempt at a blockbuster that never quite gets out of the block."
100,green_lantern,critics,rotten,n,"All the prancing about on a galaxy far far away where Hal [Ryan Reynolds] meets the other Green Lanterns, and the wise ancients, and a gigantic gruff sergeant-type who learns him his ropes is all a bit of a bore."
101,green_lantern,critics,rotten,n,"There are some fun moments in Green Lantern, and Reynolds and Sarsgaard...are truly worth watching. The movie, however, flickers between being fun and a mess."
102,green_lantern,critics,fresh,p,"While he's not a compelling enough character or superhero to care about, as Green Lantern, [Ryan Reynolds is] believable in his solemnity, yet his comedic charm helps when dealing with the absurdity that comes with the premise."
103,green_lantern,critics,rotten,n,"With a cast like that, this superhero flick, like Hal Jordan himself, had real potential to rise above its provenance. But the dialogue is simply beyond cheesy."
104,green_lantern,critics,rotten,n,"In brightest day, in blackest night...No cliche will escape my sight...I guess its really not that bad...But it certainly is loud and bright."
105,green_lantern,critics,rotten,n,"This isn't quite the stake through the heart of the superhero movie that some of its most vociferous critics are making it out to be, but it sure isn't the genre's brightest day, either."
106,green_lantern,critics,rotten,n,"If you haven't seen it, DON'T BOTHER."

109,green_lantern,critics,rotten,n,Please please please do not make a sequel.
110,green_lantern,audience,0.5,n,Bad. Possibly the worst super hero movie made.
111,green_lantern,audience,2.0,n,"Poorly written it squanders decades of comic mythology.  It has lavish effects with an unstable combination of serious, goofy and derivative.  It is a joyless amalgamation of dialogue and special effects that aren't all that special."
112,green_lantern,audience,3.0,p,The pace of the movie made the ending unlikely and hence unbelievable. I don't see how Hal could just defeat Parallax. He was still inexperienced at the end of the movie
113,green_lantern,audience,1.0,n,Один из худших фильмов жанра
114,green_lantern,audience,2.5,n,I think I could've seen Ryan Reynolds as GL Kyle Rayner.  Using Parallax right away was what killed the long-term potential of a franchise.
115,green_lantern,audience,2.5,n,"It was an okay movie. My biggest issue with it was the completely unneeded relationship that was forced down our throats. Other than that it was a pretty enjoyable movie. The CGI mask was whatever, I feel like if you let a small detail like that ruin a movie for you you have bigger issues. I've seen so much hate for this movie and I feel like most of it is not justified. It's by all means not a great movie but I have seen so much worse."
116,green_lantern,audience,3.0,p,"Film with not too bad a plot, but with obvious errors in everything else, the film is very wrong with regards to the special effects that are done not too well. A separate thought goes to the Green Lantern costume which is made ridiculously and hugely clashes with the whole setting"
117,green_lantern,audience,1.5,n,"Green Lantern is a complete disaster, with almost every aspect falling flat on its face. The most prominent dilemma with the movie is its terrible script. The overall plot is difficult to follow and does not flow right. Parallax's backstory feels so taken away by Hector Hammond's story, with both being terrible. Hector feels like a cliche outcast with a slight backstory, offering absolutely nothing to the movie. The Green Lantern Corps storyline also did not make as much sense. If the corps trust the rings so much, why is it so burdensome to put confidence in the selection of Hal Jordan? It just seemed like the screenwriters were creating these conflicts just because they wanted to. There was no actual purpose to any of the supposed disputes in the movie. The VFX and CGI are also awful. The animated suits look deeply flawed, and the other world creatures are not the best looking. Parallax and Kilowog looked particularly solid, and that is only in the handful of scenes. It doesn't help that the cinematography is particularly poor here. It feels like Dion Beebe did not have enough practical sets to present Oa, the Green Lantern planet. The framing of each shot feels off with characters shown in inconvenient positions. An abundance of scenes felt like the world around them was being hidden. Perhaps it was a good thing the world around the characters is not present as much because the production design was inadequate. Oa felt rundown and not as vibrant as it should be. That goes back to Dion Beebe's poor cinematography, as the lighting didn't feel right on Oa as well. The cast is moderately satisfactory, but it is hard to take them seriously when they do not look right. Ryan Reynolds is fine as the lead character, yet his line delivery felt like it was trying to spoof a cringe comic-book film. It's hard to tell if he is trying to be serious in his role as he doesn't sell it. Blake Lively was probably the best out of everyone in the cast, yet she didn't sell that she was in love with Hal. Actually, both Reynolds and Lively couldn't sell their supposed relationship. The two actors and the script could not get their relationship right. Peter Sarsgaard does a solid job when he is not in prosthetics, but once his head enlarges, it gets rough. Sarsgaard can not act with the prosthetics on. It is not entirely his fault, as having such a large piece of prosthetics on you limits your acting abilities. However, it does damage the movie quite a bit. The supporting cast is fine with Mark Strong and Angela Bassett doing a decent job, yet they don't have enough screen time to redeem the movie. The one decent aspect of the movie would have to be that the action sequences are pretty solid. Those scenes never feel entirely rushed or half-baked. The fight and action sequences are just right. Another aspect of the film that is not too bad is Martin Campbell's directing. It is solid, and Campbell knows how to create a tone for the movie that is achieved here and not in the visual aspects of the film. Overall, Green Lantern is a rather disappointing film that has so many deep flaws. The story is a total mess with little to no explanation on several plot points. The film has some atrocious visuals that are unacceptable in a blockbuster released in 2011. With Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively doing nothing to save this film, only Martin Campbell does the best he could at keeping Green Lantern afloat. Read more reviews like this at postcreditreviews.com"
118,green_lantern,audience,1.0,n,I watched about 20 minutes of this garbage thinking it was a new movie.  I never seen it in 2011.....thank god for that.  Even just watching the 20 minutes I knew this was stinker....too much special effects and bad acting
119,green_lantern,audience,5.0,p,"One of the most underatted movies of all time.  If this is so bad, why is it currently sitting in the top 10 most viewed on Netflix.  Yes, the special effects are a bit dated given is was made years ago, but this movie largerly got panned becaue RR wasn't the serious (and boring) batman or spiderman that was the sterotype at the time.  Face it, RR set the stage for the personality of the modern superhero, and looking back at this film hopefully people can appreciate now what he did to the genre."
120,ghost_rider_spirit_of_vengeance,critics,rotten,n,Cheesy CGI that is either intentional or just plain awful.
121,ghost_rider_spirit_of_vengeance,critics,fresh,p,You may find yourself infinitely more forgiving of its lack of quality if you pretend it's simply a low budget Troma flick rather than a multi-million dollar studio picture...

132,ghost_rider_spirit_of_vengeance,critics,rotten,n,"Ghost Rider only excels when it embraces the gonzo direction of directors Neveldine and Taylor. Sadly though, the film seems to be pumping its brakes more than riding with a vengeance."
133,ghost_rider_spirit_of_vengeance,critics,rotten,n,"Save your money. Read ""The Devil and Daniel Webster"" or ""Doctor Faustus."" Listen to Robert Johnson. Or just be a decent human being, so you'll never have the devil to pay."
134,ghost_rider_spirit_of_vengeance,critics,rotten,n,"Only a marginal improvement over the leaden first film, with Idris Elba providing a number of the film's few bright spots."

138,ghost_rider_spirit_of_vengeance,critics,fresh,p,"A goofy, gonzo thrill ride, Vengeance is a bad movie sequel so bad it's good -- a bad movie that's almost a great bad movie."
139,ghost_rider_spirit_of_vengeance,critics,fresh,p,An unwanted sequel to one of the worst comic book films ever made blasts onto the screen with such assaultive energy that memories of its predecessor are incinerated from your brain.
140,ghost_rider_spirit_of_vengeance,audience,2.0,n,"This has to be some of the worst acting I’ve seen from Nicholas Cage. The writing is also terrible. Too bad, because the first movie was fun."
141,ghost_rider_spirit_of_vengeance,audience,1.5,n,"While Johnny's Ghost Rider form does look more hellish than in the previous film (I compared it to looking like butane) the plot is somehow even more inane.  Also contradicts itself, since in the first film Mephisto (then Peter Fonda) was never said to be dependent on having a human body to inhabit."
142,ghost_rider_spirit_of_vengeance,audience,0.5,n,"A film so obnoxiously fetid, I had to play it at 1.5 the speed so I could get it over and done with. Unmitigated shite from start to finish. Avoid like the fucking plague."
143,ghost_rider_spirit_of_vengeance,audience,0.5,n,i would give it zero stars if that was an option. they completely changed the storyline compared too the first on and somehow the rider can now work during daylight hours. wtf. totally ruined the plotline and the worst part they didnt even bother to recast nicolas cage who is by far the worst actor i have ever had the displeasure of watching. the dude only has one facial expression. (confused)
144,ghost_rider_spirit_of_vengeance,audience,1.0,n,"For a ""super-hero"" movie, this movie is remarkably boring.  Just a collection of set pieces filled with uncoordinated CGI effects and redundant fight scenes.  The origin story for the rider is mildly interesting, but expressed in such an off hand way that it is more like a lecture from UFO-TV.  I really wish that Cage had not bought so many castles."
145,ghost_rider_spirit_of_vengeance,audience,2.0,n,"Yeesh, a sequel with less brains than the original manages to capitalize on all of the poor aspects of the first film. I did find the first to be a guilty pleasure, but I can’t say the same for Spirit of Vengeance. The tacky CGI, the bonkers plot, and the campiness prove to be too much. It’s a shame really, because this character could be really cool if in a better production"
146,ghost_rider_spirit_of_vengeance,audience,2.5,n,Just as dumb as the first one but it bothers me less probably because the movie is trimmed of any superfluous narrative. Also the digital cinematography is genuinely impressive.
147,ghost_rider_spirit_of_vengeance,audience,0.5,n,"Not as good as first, which was a pretty low bar for nics potential"
148,ghost_rider_spirit_of_vengeance,audience,0.5,n,"This movie is so bad Idris Elba gave up acting seriously after he heard himself speak in a french accent. If a movie can't be saved by cageness, it must be next level bad. I feel really bad for Ciaran Hinds he mad an effort until the end. A sad waste of time, nothing more."
149,ghost_rider_spirit_of_vengeance,audience,1.0,n,"Even though I didn't like the original Ghost Rider movie just like any other sane person, I still thought of giving the second movie a chance, thinking probably they must have thought something this time, which is why they suddenly decided to make a sequel of the 2007 flop movie. And the way it began I was even convinced that it's gonna be better. Turns out this one is even worse.

You gotta give them this one - the CGI flame on Ghost Rider now looks a lot more believable. But the VFX of anything else is terrible. Occasionally the movie uses weird emboss and black-and-white effect as if it's a Bollywood movie. It seemed as though the editors had just got After Effects and they wanted to add every effect they could find.

The story has no connection with the first film whatsoever. They even get the recap wrong! It shows that Johnny fell to the Devil's feet and cut his finger intentionally to sign the contract, while in reality the Devil had come to his tent when he was repairing his bike, and his finger accidentally got cut and the blood fell on the contract. The setting also doesn't make any sense. Johnny moved to Middle East because he didn't want to hurt anyone. But that's literally what he does there also. And in spite of being set in Middle East they don't show anything related to Middle East throughout the movie.

The acting continues to hold the same momentum as the prequel, by which I mean the same campy overacting. At least this time Johnny doesn't point at people and say ""You!"". Instead in the end he said ""Hell yes."" after pushing the Devil back in hell.

I'm really grateful that this series didn't have a third movie. Ghost Rider needs to be a grim, gritty movie with a lot of violence and heavy metal music, not this campy film series. Because no matter what you say, I can never take Nicolas Cage seriously. He's a fusion of Govinda and Uday Chopra. And I can't consider that to be the demon hunting Ghost Rider."

Sadly, Kennedy is either unwilling or unable to deliver a similar  energy. The plot is childish and uninspired, as is the acting.

Forced, phony, falsely-exaggerated conflicts. Completely antithetical to some of the most important characters, and often self-contradictory & flip-floppy even w/in that. An absolute bird-flip to all fans who read the books for the characters. For instance, as if under any circumstance, the lovely, elegant, and brilliant Beast/Hank McCoy could ever have even the slightest urge to revenge kill one of his best friends, over what he knew to be an accident. Let alone enough to form a posse and sick the mad dogs on her?? BS. That's just one small example of how absurdly this movie betrays its own premises. Dweeby casting for Nightcrawler, and a total bastardization of many other key players.

So bad that Halle Berry herself called it god-awful when she personally picked her Razzie Award. But as a guilty pleasure... well then. This is one hell of a guilty pleasure movie for me and I'll explain why.
This movie is basically The Room of the superhero genre. It's the kind of bad that makes you have a good time in the end. At least that's how it is for me. This movie's the kind of bad that ends up being very entertaining. Halle Berry being forced to rub catnip on her face... it just cracks me the hell up every time I see it. How can it not ? A actual human with a (questionable)brain actually wrote that in a script. Not to mention how it takes the name ''Catwoman'' absolutely literally and the outfit for her is...well it's a sight to behold. But thankfully, the movie has a pretty banger soundtrack, especially the song ''Who's in Control'' by Natasha Schneider. 
If you wanna have a good laugh and are looking for a guilty pleasure sort of movie, then Catwoman is one of my personal recommendations."

55,turbo_a_power_rangers_movie,audience,1.0,n,"A failure at all ends, ""Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie"" should've been given the name ""Turd-O: A Power Rangers Assrape."" There's no need to ask why: The Blue Ranger is a 12-year-old, the Rangers themselves hardly morph, and the special effects are terrible. The creation of the Turbo powers isn't explained, and neither is how they lost the Zeo powers. Their suits are made of spandex and their transformation command has went from ""It's morphin' time"" to ""Shift into Turbo,"" and that really sucks. The plot is poorly written, and the demon Maligore looks more like a flame dragon than a actual demon. Bad direction, a endless amount of plot holes, and terrible fight scenes doom this film from the start. ""Turbo"" is just a extended episode of Power Rangers, and it never rises to achieve more than that."
56,turbo_a_power_rangers_movie,audience,1.0,n,"There should've been only one Power Rangers movie. Lookin' at it, this film is worse than the MMPR film: the action is boring, the special effects look cheaper (and typical of the television series), and none of the actors appear interested in where the plot's goin'. As for the suits, this one drops the armor-like costumes in favor for the fucked-up spandex that the TV series uses. The worst part? The 12-year-old Blue Ranger, who grows 'bout a foot or so every time he morphs, which is honestly proof of the poor execution that ""Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie"" gives. As a whole, it's more like a extended episode of Power Rangers than a actual film and could even be the franchise's own ""Superman IV."" Funny thing is even Jason David Frank (the lone bright spot) thought this was a terrible movie, and he was in it...and he knows that ""Turbo"" is gettin' The Burnin' Medallion Of Badness. And BTW, before I break it all down, I noticed somethin' odd: The White Ranger in ""Gosei Sentai Dairanger,"" the second ""Super Sentai"" series that was used on ""Power Rangers,"" is known as the Kiba Ranger, and he's actually a 9-year-old boy (later 10). Ironically enough, the Blue Racer in ""Gekisou Sentai Carranger,"" which was the source material for the show that followed this film, is a teenager and not a 12-year-old like Justin. Also, IMO, if he's 12-years-old, why does Justin look like a 10-year-old? And why does he sound like that? That still bothers me. To close things out, ""Turbo"" feels like a cheap fever dream. And honestly, it's bad. Real bad. It's not a good look for anyone. Characters: 1/5 Story: 1/5 Acting: 1/5 Special Effects: 0/5 Direction: 0/5 Cinematography: 1/5 Soundtrack (Songs & Score, mostly heavy metal music related to what it sets the stage for): 1/5 Overall: 1/5"
57,turbo_a_power_rangers_movie,audience,3.5,p,"I loved the movie, the only ""bad"" things that, personally speaking, the studios neither made nor took advantage of is that the zeo powers were barelly mentioned in the movie and what happened with Rocky (that he got his back injured and had to leave the team, passing on his Blue Ranger powers to Justin). Another ""bad"" thing of the movie is that Rita and Lord Zedd barely appear in the movie (I think it would be considered more like a cameo than a normal appereance), making them tell that, from one moment to another, just lose interest in their plan to conquer Earth after defeating King Mondo and his family and also that Divatox just appeared from nowhere to try to conquer Earth herself. In addition, they recruited a kid to take the place of Rocky in the team, risking his own life in order to complete the team. In Super Sentai version, Gekisou Sentai Carranger, Blue Racer is a teenager, but not a kid, they tryed to adapt that from the Sentai, but making a mistake of risking a kid to fight evil (that would be a contradiction with the Power Rangers ideals to protect the people).
Beside those plot mistakes/holes, I loved the rest of the movie"
58,turbo_a_power_rangers_movie,audience,2.0,n,Not a great movie. There are better power rangers episodes then this movie. You will need to watch it if you are going through the series. It needs to be watched before you watch the Turbo series.

83,zoom_2006,audience,0.5,n,"Superheroes are usually meant for an older audience. But aiming for a much younger crowd, can be achieved, under the right circumstances. In fact, take a look at 2004's ""The Incredibles"", a superhero feature that caters to both adults and kids at the same time. Naturally, many other studios wanted to cash in on this type of success, and thus, Sony tried their hardest to make a superhero feature called ""Zoom"" in the year 2006. The key word being tried. Because, what ultimately happened was that this movie failed miserably, both at the box office, and with the critics. Is this statement true? Why, yes, yes it is. ""Zoom"" is an absolute failure from start to finish. From awful acting, poor pacing, and worst of all, a bad script that is based on a book, ""Zoom"" doesn't work in any kind of sense. There is nothing redeemable that makes it good; this is easily one of the worst superhero films of all time. Whatever Sony was thinking to turn this into a franchise, ""Zoom"" just wasn't it.

The story follows a group of kids that are recruited to a secret military base in order to become superheroes. These include two teenagers Dylan and Summer (Michael Cassidy and Kate Mara respectively), and two children Tucker and Cindy (Spencer Breslin and Ryan Newman respectively). Together, this quartet are being trained under the tutelage of a former superhero: Captain Zoom (Tim Allen). Unfortunately, Zoom doesn't want to do this, and wants to live his own life. As time eventually goes on, Zoom must find ways in order to make peace with these kids, as well as to be a part of a team once more. And in doing so, they must stop an old villain from Zoom's past before he breaks havoc onto the world once more.

""Zoom"" is a really bad film. And here's why.

The acting is awful. Not only just from Allen, who acts like he doesn't want to be here, but from all the other major players that are present in this production. In the movie, we also have access to bad performances from Rip Torn, Courtney Cox, and even Chevy Chase, just to name a few. The kid actors are all right, as are the teenage actors, but nobody turns out a decent performance, as they really don't seem to care whether or not they are here on the set or not.

This can contributed to the direction from Peter Hewitt. It feels like there is no sense of direction from him, as all the actors either do not care, or just do whatever they feel like. And this wasn't the first time Peter was behind the director's chair, but it nearly looks like this was going to be his last.

Next, we have the music. It's pretty much non-existent. What I mean by this is that while the main orchestrated score by Christophe Beck, it's mostly pushed over to the side by a pop soundtrack. Oh, and most of the songs in general are done by rock band Smash Mouth, because that worked so well with 2001's ""Shrek"". And even when the orchestration is being delivered, it's not that memorable. For instance, there should have been a lot more action pieces, but instead, we get more of a comedic tone delivered. What were they thinking?

The costumes and set design is also generic and boring. It's your typical lab coats and same matching outfits. Nothing really stands out.

But the biggest crime that the movie serves up is with its story and writing. The story combines a lot of other superhero origins from other narratives, i.e. X-Men and Fantastic Four for example, and it just doesn't work. There are a lot of plot holes, not a lot of character development, and overall, no major buildup to the final confrontation with the main villain. As for the writing,it's formulaic, predictable, and overall not funny. The main purpose of a comedy, is to be funny, but here, it feels like all of the humor is sucked out, and replaced with nothing.

The editing and pacing can be a real deal breaker here. At roughly 90 minutes, the film moves at rather fast pace, and there is no time for the movie to slow down or take a break. If the movie could have added a couple of extra minutes and taken its time, then we wouldn't have the mess that was produced. The editing plays a huge factor in this as well. Everything moves irregularly, and there are times when the editing just wants to do whatever it wants. That just makes this film even worse.

But the sad reality is that this could have worked. Something like could have worked out, and what we would have gotten, would be something good. Given the right direction and script, this would have turned out great.

But as it is, ""Zoom"" is a bad and terrible superhero film that tries is hardest to appeal to the younger demographic, yet ultimately earns its place in the bargain bin."

113,supergirl,audience,4.0,p,"There are some great NOW moments in Supergirl, like when she lands on earth and is immediately sexually harassed. That's no way to treat a Supergirl after all that flying, but what do you expect from a dilapidated circus town held together by some immoral witches?

Peter O'Toole freaked me out as a kid, I didn't think he was the best teacher for Supergirl when he looked so unwell. Now all I see when I look at Supergirl's sensei is this, Brian Blessed on doing Macbeth with O'Toole via The DM:

""And so the disaster unfolded. He'd had a bath put onstage filled to the brim with fake blood. After he killed Duncan, Macbeth got in the bath and almost drowned. When he got out, there was blood all over the stage; actors came on, slipped and went flying. This brought the house down — with laughter."""
114,supergirl,audience,3.0,p,"In a movie with tons of flaws, the only redeeming quality is Helen Slater’s great performance as Kara Zor-El/Linda Danvers/Supergirl"
115,supergirl,audience,2.0,n,"When Kara arrives on Earth, we first see her powers as she wards off an attempted rape by two truckers who are completely unperturbed by her super breath and heat vision. When she asks naively why they are attacking her, one (Matt Frewer) responds, ""It's just the way we are."" But to my ear, rather than some indictment of human nature or toxic masculinity, this sounds more like the perpetual failure of the writers to justify or explain practically anything in the story, as the characters time and again make the most bafflingly stupid decisions."
116,supergirl,audience,1.5,n,"Striking cinematography, set and costume design are brilliant and striking in what’s one of the weirdest mainstream films ever made. A hybrid of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Dick Tracy, Pink Floyd’s “The Wall”, Superman and what seemed like a lot of acid - this is an art film masquerading as popcorn fare. Don’t get me wrong - it’s objectively terrible - but in a hilariously entertaining and confounding way. None of the actors are on the same page, the script is all over the place and barely makes sense, Peter O’Toole and Faye Dunaway are slumming it here - (but Dunaway is giving it her all - for some reason. O’Toole seems like he drunkenly walked on to set). The construction, plumber, whatever guy is an absolute buffoon, and the supporting actors don’t know whether they’re in a comedy or a deadly serious children’s film. The only one who comes out unscathed is Helen Slater - who approaches Supergirl with calmness and grace. If you love “so bad it’s good” cinema - “Supergirl” is a must. For everyone else, stay very far away."

129,suicide_squad_2016,critics,rotten,n,"Once again, DC has made a film that feels less original and more like they're just mimicking what they see Marvel doing. Its tone is all over the place and we aren't given enough time to get to know the characters so we can care about their fates."

As a fan of the comics and these characters I really wanted to leave this movie and have it at the top of my recommended movies list. While fans of the comics will enjoy it, many will feel that there is something left to be desired. For regular movie-goers, though, the random cuts and edits may cause some people to leave the theatre not understanding some of the characters or why they were even there to begin with. I do recommend checking out the movie though, and I am very hopeful that a director's cut does get released sometime in the future."

173,superman_iv_the_quest_for_peace,audience,0.5,n,"When you have the perfect Superman actor in Christopher Reeve, a perfect supporting cast including Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor and award-winning special effects at your disposal, it shouldn't be hard to produce a good Superman movie, yet Superman IV says otherwise. Perhaps it was the fact that the Salkinds were no longer in charge. Perhaps it was because the new producers gave too much creative control to their principle actor. Certainly the cut in budget to a mere third of what was spent on Superman II did not help. The result is another silly, cheap instalment in the franchise that made it clear that the well was dry and there would be no Superman V starring Christoper Reeve. The concept at the core of the film, that the earth needs to be rid of nuclear weapons, has some merit, but the screenplay that emerged from that idea is lame. The idea that Superman's DNA could somehow be used to create an alternative flying man who looks nothing like Superman and is created as a fully grown, talking man in an instant when some nuclear bombs are hurled into the sun....argggh. The acting is terrible, the special effects are rubbish and the script, let's just say it needed work. We've already seen Superman battle some flying super-powered adversaries in Superman II. We didn't need to see an alternative version in Superman IV, especially not this hairsprayed, buffed, golden tanned rock star-looking villain that is ""Nuclear Man"", played by Mark Pillow. The fight scenes with Superman and Nuclear Man were not well conceived and poorly filmed. Even the ending was bad. If Superman really wants to do good in this world, he should give the audience their money back."
174,superman_iv_the_quest_for_peace,audience,3.0,p,"First off, I did like The Superman story, where he decides to destroy all of Earth’s Nuclear weapons before deciding that it is not his responsibility to prevent war but it is ours. We must continue to usher peace on Earth and He can only guide the people of Earth to show the way to peace. It’s also great to see Gene Hackman return as Lex Luthor. Nuclear Man however isn’t really that great of a Villian, but his fight scenes with Supes are pretty cool. I also would have liked if Clark didn’t give Lois that mindwipe kiss (Again!) The Only saving grace in this movie is the phenomenal acting of Christopher Reeve giving his all in his final performance as Clark Kent/Superman."
175,superman_iv_the_quest_for_peace,audience,1.0,n,"Even with the performance of Christopher Reeve and a nice message about nuclear weapons,the story is a shattered shell of a at best mediocre script and a movie that was so chopped up in editing, so plagued with budgetary constraints that 45 minutes of the entire runtime was cut from the final product."
176,superman_iv_the_quest_for_peace,audience,0.5,n,"I can't trash a movie that stars late actors Reeves, Kidder and Cooper (and Hackman who at this writing is still with us), playing their iconic roles, especially in light of how Reeves and Kidder tragically lived and passed.  If you want to see these terrific actors in their awe-inspiring roles and be thrilled while doing so, watch Superman 1 and 2 (theatrical ver., IMOP)."
177,superman_iv_the_quest_for_peace,audience,0.5,n,"Well, while the third film didn't flat-out work for me, ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace"" is hands-down much worse, since it's cinematic kryptonite; not only could it kill the ""Superman"" series, it might also leave filmgoers feelin' weak. Right from the offset, the special effects look cheaper compared to the previous films. For instance, the Cannon Group simply reuses the same shot of Superman in flight, and during the moon scene, you can actually see the black curtain that should represent space. The action is boring as well, and none of the actors even appear interested in where the plot's going either. As if to showcase the ""boring action"" problem, for instance, Superman and Nuclear Man don't even punch each other in battle. So yeah, ""Superman IV: The Quest for a Plot"" or ""Superman Farce: The Search for a Quick Buck"" could have fit the film better for titles. Clearly this film didn't work for me. The only good thing is that Christopher Reeve was the best actor to portray the Man of Steel and this was his final film."

27,the_spirit,audience,4.0,p,"A film with a unique aesthetic. With a noir touch in its general ambience. The story is good, but the overall development is ""cartoonish"" like the comics of the 70s."
28,the_spirit,audience,3.5,p,"The movie opens with The Spirit doing his reflective Rorschach soliloquy as he runs through the dark of a Sin City-esque landscape. The Spirit originated in the 40s, thus the look and sound aound mentioned above. Does the movie break any new ground? Its sparce, graphic look with cartoon characters has been done before, as alluded to previously. The acting is solid with quirky characters and a standard down-and-out boy and girl going good and bad respectively backstory. But again here and throughout the rest of the film nothing outstanding but nothing terrible. Why the movie has such a low rating is beyond me. I've seen much worse."
29,the_spirit,audience,4.0,p,"It seems that we've become immune to movies that venture off the beaten path, films that don't fit squarely into an applicable genre. They must follow a cookie-cutter script and directorial manifesto in order to even be considered a ""must see,"" such as with most of the ""Americanized"" movies that we watch year-round. This rings true with one film currently in theatres, The Spirit, which dares to reconfigure the norm, with offbeat humour, unorthodox cinematography, and subtly alluring characters that don't need to win Oscars in order to captivate us into hoping for a sequel.

Set in what seems an ambiguous time period (characters play with Blackberry-type gadgets, yet drive around in old-school cars and use vocabulary that was probably common in the '30s or '40s), in a New York-styled metropolis known as Central City, Frank Miller's The Spirit is shot in the same vein as another recent comic book adaptation, Sin City, though this one uses a lighter tone to convey its plot. Not surprisingly, Sin City was Miller's directorial debut, in a joint endeavour with Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino.

Little-known Gabriel Macht does come off generic at times as a former by-the-book cop who mysteriously parishes only to resurrect as the film's heroic namesake, but graces us with an unusual charisma at others, and co-star Samuel L. Jackson lends his one-of-a-kind screen presence as The Spirit's nemesis The Octopus. And let's not forget about the ladies that keep The Spirit on its toes. Latino vixen Eva Mendes dominates every scene she's in, and Scarlett Johansson braves the cold with a stiff, yet enjoyable, role as Jackson's evil sidekick. Even Stana Katic, who plays an underestimated rookie cop, brings subtle charm to her short time onscreen, as do the countless simple-minded clones portrayed by TV vet Louis Lombardi.

I'm sure that Miller--who also adapted the screenplay--never set out to capture awards or garner excessive critical praise when he agreed to bring The Spirit to the big screen, but rather to maintain a trend of off-colour comic book-based features that offer an alternative to the Spider-Man's and Batman's of the Hollywood machine (both of which are superb franchises). And in the case of The Spirit, I'm glad he is."

38,teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_2013,critics,rotten,n,"1990's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a plain cheese with a little pepperoni for flavor.

63,batman_v_superman_dawn_of_justice,critics,fresh,p,"Batman v Superman is almost unrelentingly dark, making the two-and-a-half hour movie tougher to get through than the lighter-toned Marvel movies. But it earns its superhero stripes thanks to great performances and some truly knockout action scenes."
64,batman_v_superman_dawn_of_justice,critics,rotten,n,"At 2 hours and 33 minutes in length, the plot has some clear pacing issues. Too many ideas, whilst not enough happening."

69,batman_v_superman_dawn_of_justice,critics,rotten,n,"There was a time when superhero movies were fun, escapist entertainment. But now our caped and cowled heroes are as dark and troubled as a reject from a Kafka novel which, in this case, makes for a rather loud but dreary night at the movies."
70,batman_v_superman_dawn_of_justice,critics,rotten,n,It would be nice if there was a moment of dialogue that allowed us to care about the heroes we look up to on the big screen.
71,batman_v_superman_dawn_of_justice,critics,rotten,n,It's bad enough that a single movie isn't big enough for both Batman and Superman; it's even worse that they must share the screen with Wonder Woman and several new villains.
72,batman_v_superman_dawn_of_justice,critics,fresh,p,Cinematography and editing were good. The CGI effects were not overly-done or poorly-executed and that was all this movie needed to be as entertaining and exciting as it was.
73,batman_v_superman_dawn_of_justice,critics,fresh,p,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is kind of wonderful in a steampunk meets industrial punk sort of way.

83,batman_v_superman_dawn_of_justice,audience,5.0,p,"I loved this movie, its imagery, symbolism, smart plot, well developed characters. I was specially surprised by this Batman, a jaded, older and fallen crime fighter, and Ben Affleck portrayal was perfect. Superman heroism and sacrifice helped bring Bruce back from the darkness and now after watching ZSJL, I loved BvS even more. A true masterpiece for the ages and a bit ahead of its time."
84,batman_v_superman_dawn_of_justice,audience,5.0,p,"Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice (Ultimate Cut) is a one of a kind.

89,batman_v_superman_dawn_of_justice,audience,1.0,n,I've tried so hard to like this movie but just can't. It actually stinks to high hell. The only highlight is Henry Cavil and how invested he is in his character. I don't really think WB is doing him any justice.
90,teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_iii,critics,rotten,n,"The movie takes an excessively long time to cover short narrative ground, and the plot is muddled enough to confuse the target audience."

94,teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_iii,critics,rotten,n,"Less amateurish than the 1990 original, less embarrassing than the 1991 sequel (with its mind-boggling Vanilla Ice ninja-rap number), this may be the easiest installment in the series for parents to sit through."
95,teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_iii,critics,rotten,n,Really stupid.
96,teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_iii,critics,rotten,n,"Writer/director Stuart Gillard tries to inject some life into the project by including some tongue-in-cheek scenes in 17th-century Japan, but it quickly degenerates into half-hearted cartoonish action."
97,teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_iii,critics,rotten,n,"These fighting-intensive movies, a glorification of hurtful action, are strictly for children. While the corpse count is low, the mimicking turtles stand for nothing more important than the employment of physical force."
98,teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_iii,critics,rotten,n,The comic book and animated incarnations of the Turtles remain far funnier and more inventive.
99,teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_iii,critics,rotten,n,The oversized terrapins are characteristically flip as they backflip through an unnecessarily muddled plot.
100,teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_iii,critics,rotten,n,The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series comes to a close with an installment that ultimately falls right in line with its subpar predecessors...
101,teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_iii,critics,rotten,n,"This third film is easily the weakest of the bunch, but I can't say it's terrible."
102,teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_iii,critics,rotten,n,A decided case of diminishing returns.
103,teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_iii,critics,rotten,n,If the time-travel gimmick has to be employed twice in a row then it's probably best to banish these characters to a retirement sewer.

111,jonah_hex,critics,rotten,n,"For a supernatural Western about a hardened bounty hunter who comes back from the dead to take revenge, everything about this film is rather restrained."
112,jonah_hex,critics,rotten,n,"Unless you're a Megan Fox fanboy with no cinematic standards to speak of, then Jonah Hex isn't worth your time."
113,jonah_hex,critics,rotten,n,Jimmy Hayward's film is a cartoonish melange of cliché set-pieces seemingly ripped straight from the pages of the comic with no thought as to how they would make a coherent on-screen narrative.
114,jonah_hex,critics,rotten,n,The wildly dissonant tone caroms so haphazardly between self-satire and self-seriousness (sometimes within the same scene!) that it's impossible to form anything resembling an attachment to the characters or situations.
115,jonah_hex,critics,rotten,n,The really sad part is that Josh Brolin is great as Jonah...
116,jonah_hex,critics,fresh,p,"It's popcorn-chomping fun rooting for the soul-stripped Hex as he battles his way toward redemption and sweet, sweet payback."
117,jonah_hex,critics,rotten,n,"It's a little too brief to get bored exactly, but it's certainly long enough to get frustrated at the lack of the essential ingredients to get the audience engaged in its story."
118,jonah_hex,critics,fresh,p,
119,jonah_hex,critics,rotten,n,It's a standard Western revenge tale dressed up with supernatural elements.
120,jonah_hex,critics,rotten,n,"The mark of a good actor is being good in a really bad movie. Josh Brolin is a really, really good actor, because most of the time he's on screen speaking you can almost forget what a loathsome, irredeemable, turd of a film Jonah Hex is."
121,jonah_hex,critics,fresh,p,"When it works, which it does quite often, it's one of the better comic book adaptations of recent years."
122,jonah_hex,critics,rotten,n,Seems almost calculated meticulously to suck the life out of its audience as much as humanly possible...
123,jonah_hex,critics,rotten,n,"The film is simply too brief, too befuddled and too delirious to do the comic book legend justice."
124,jonah_hex,critics,rotten,n,An awful excuse for cinema that ultimately fails in nearly every way possible.
125,jonah_hex,critics,rotten,n,"...remarkably two-dimensional, showing evidence of having been edited down from something more complex."

128,jonah_hex,critics,rotten,n,The film shows its comic-book origins in good ways (stylish settings) and bad (too many scenes end in a gigantic conflagration).
129,jonah_hex,critics,rotten,n,"Whether it's the director's fault or the result of studio meddling, this is a mess of a movie that's been cut to pieces."
130,jonah_hex,audience,1.5,n,A character like Jonah Hex just has too much backstory to be crammed into an 80 minute movie.  Would fare better in a TV series.
131,jonah_hex,audience,0.5,n,"What a horrible movie this was, in fact I can only give it 1/2 stars."
132,jonah_hex,audience,2.5,n,"Th supernatural aspect wasn't explained very well, but there was mildly decent action even though the plot was fairly simple. I didn't understand a lot of the historical aspects either, but it was mildly interesting to watch."
133,jonah_hex,audience,1.0,n,"This has truly got to be one of the stupidest movie I have ever seen.  For a plot that is so simplistic, it comes forth on the screen as an unnecessarily convoluted, poorly edited and poorly directed film.  It's like the poor unwanted child of ""Wild Wild West"" and ""Ghost rider."""
134,jonah_hex,audience,2.5,n,"A cool concept for a movie. Had a real Wild Wild West feel to it. I expected better acting than what I got but honestly I didn't think this movie was going to blow my socks off. Still, probably worth a watch at least once."
135,jonah_hex,audience,4.0,p,"I thought this was a great film despite the bad reviews. Not sure why it only got 12% on Rotten Tomatoes either. 

It was action packed from start to finish and great acting. 

Please don't listen to critics as they about put me off watching it - so glad I decided to watch and decide for myself though......"
136,jonah_hex,audience,2.5,n,"Hex's plot is almost plagiarized from the Will Smith 'Wild Wild West'.  Civil War veteran is enlisted by the president to help stop an ex-Confederate crazy from using steam-punk weapons to take over the country.  While WWW was fun and campy, Hex's tone is more gritty, with lots of gratuitous violence and rock music.  There are some attempts to 'graphic novel' the film stylistically with cartoon overlays and weird special effects, but those seem oddly intermittent, and the film teeters between something like '300' or 'Legend of the Sword' and a standard western.
Hex is not awful, and Josh Brolin is always fun to watch, but the film feels overly dark and joyless."
137,jonah_hex,audience,4.0,p,"LIKED THE COMICS ,LOVED IT. VERY ENTERTAINING."
138,jonah_hex,audience,1.5,n,"Yet another disastrous DC movie. The only things from stopping this being a ½ star review are the effects and Brolin's performance as Hex. This is a movie that should have been so much better, as the underlying story is a good one. But with a script so lame it should be put down, and direction so obvious and heavy-handed that what good there is here is totally laid waste to."
139,jonah_hex,audience,3.0,p,"A lot of butt-hurt DC fanboys in the comments, along with a lot of mentally weak spoileds who critisize pointless details. That being said, no better or worse than most comic action / adventure movies. We've seen this story before and many of you liked it, just not now. Bunch a spoileds"

144,underdog,critics,rotten,n,"Underdog works best when spoofing superhero conventions, but the film goes to the dogs thanks to a drab story and frequent stabs at heartwarming bromides."
145,underdog,critics,rotten,n,The essential cartooniness of the plot and the gags works against the rather lame attempt to lather on a message about reconciliation between father and son.
146,underdog,critics,rotten,n,"While this idea may have been enough to happily fill 25 minutes, the film version fails to effectively stretch it out to feature-length."
147,underdog,critics,fresh,p,"Call me a kid at heart, but Underdog is the cutest doggone fantasy."
148,underdog,critics,rotten,n,At just over 80 minutes it feels not so much like a proper film as a piece of extended filler for slow afternoons on Disney's TV channels.
149,underdog,critics,rotten,n,"...an affable, sporadically entertaining piece of work that's ultimately undone by its emphasis on relentlessly silly elements..."

151,underdog,critics,rotten,n,
152,underdog,critics,rotten,n,An ill-conceived and often irritating bout of Children's film fare...
153,underdog,critics,rotten,n,Disney's charmless live-action resurrection of the beloved super-mutt [is] just a bunch of mercenary actors and technicians who can barely disguise their contempt for the film's screenplay
154,underdog,critics,rotten,n,"...rather dull and uninspired, lacking in imagination or humorous spark."
155,underdog,critics,rotten,n,"A boring and uninspiring adaptation that lacks action and suffers from mostly static characters, Peter Dinklage as the nefarious Dr. Simon Barsinister being the notable exception."
156,underdog,critics,rotten,n,"par for the course in a town that sees every old idea as something waiting to be deconstructed, reinvented, or reimagined."

160,underdog,audience,2.0,n,There IS a need to fear.
161,underdog,audience,3.0,p,"This Disney superhero movie was pretty good. Jason Lee, Jim Belushi, Peter Dinklage, Patrick Warburton, Amy Adams, Alex Neuberger, and the rest of the cast did a good job in this movie. The plot of the movie was kind of entertaining and humorous. It's not as bad as most people say it was, but it's not very good either. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you may enjoy it."
162,underdog,audience,5.0,p,It was my favorite movie as a child
163,underdog,audience,2.0,n,"Here he comes to save the day - is it a bird, is it a meteor, nah, its just plain little ole me Underdog!!"
164,underdog,audience,1.0,n,An animated Underdog theatrical release probably had a  better chance at boxoffice  success overall than a live action feature.
165,underdog,audience,2.0,n,"Begins well, but soon deteriotiates into a disappointment - culminating with an incredibly forced 'gag reel' in the end credits.

'Underdog' means well and is, in all honesty, a harmless 81 minute film. As touched on, it does start off fairly promisingly. I liked how Peter Dinklage and Patrick Warburton were introduced, while the set up for the dog isn't as bad as it could've been. It does other decent things, like the effects for Underdog are solid and the quippy, rhyme-filled dialogue for him actually, somehow, works.

However, it ultimately suffers from tedious story creation and execution. As the film goes on, I felt less and less interested in the premise and also nonplussed about the superhero dog - the gimmick wears off quick, even for what is a short production. The end shebang is also very boring.

I can't say I disliked this majorly, to be fair. It's just a poor and forgettable 2007 film from Disney."
166,underdog,audience,2.0,n,"A bland superhero movie based off of a '60s cartoon I've never heard of done in a Rocky & Bullwinkle art style, Underdog has decent CGI effects, there apparently was proper research done this time unlike the blatant disrespect towards Inspector Gadget and Jason Lee does a good job voicing the titular character making his lines much more entertaining to listen to than if it was anybody else. But the acting from real people is stilted other than the hammy villains, the script is your average family comedy stuff, the action's not that great, the humour is juvenile despite Jason Lee making things more tolerable and the direction is clumsy (though what else can you expect when you get the director of everybody's favourite animated movie from the '90s, Quest for Camelot to make a film adaptation of a relatively obscure cartoon?). Theme song was cool, though. Underdog wasn't the worst live-action movie based off of a cartoon but it isn't very good, failing to stand out amongst both that pack and the superhero genre. Which is certainly not a good sign when you realize that in the pre-Marvel days, Disney had some actually pretty solid superhero movies of their own. But alas, Underdog is not one of those movies."
167,underdog,audience,5.0,p,This is the third movie I wanted to watch again during quarantine life.
168,underdog,audience,1.5,n,"Very sloppy and rushed. The jokes just felt thrown together desperately to get a giggle out of somebody, hopefully. It lacked enthusiasm, genuinity, and punch. Possibly will itch some nostalgia for fans of the original cartoon, but overall a pretty weak effort. Could've been a straight to video/TV movie. There were some cool remixes of the original theme though."
169,underdog,audience,2.0,n,"Kids may enjoy it, but adults will avoid it because of its dated jokes, derivative plot, and unremarkable production values."
170,blade_trinity,critics,rotten,n,Leave it to Parker Posey to be the best part of two major horror franchises' dismal third entries.

172,blade_trinity,critics,rotten,n,"It was very boring, and all the guns looked like plastic toys."
173,blade_trinity,critics,rotten,n,"Blade makes no bones about being a B-movie and that is one of its saving graces. It's kind of silly, goes on too long, and doesn't make a great deal of sense, but there are a few moments that entertain."
174,blade_trinity,critics,rotten,n,"I'm a great fan of Blade, the Marvel Comics vampire hunter played by Wesley Snipes... But a third episode, Blade: Trinity, directed by David S. Goyer, is a blood fest too far."
175,blade_trinity,critics,rotten,n,"A trainwreck set to a booming soundtrack, turning vampire hunting into a screen chore while it almost intentionally torches the macabre groundwork laid down by the first two features."
176,blade_trinity,critics,rotten,n,For series fans only. Definitely NOT for kids!
177,blade_trinity,critics,rotten,n,The weakest of the trilogy.

179,blade_trinity,critics,fresh,p,"To me Blade Trinity deftly dances at the edge of ""So bad it's good"" territory, staying just on the side of being good."
180,blade_trinity,critics,rotten,n,"a move that reeks of market manipulation, a couple of young sidekicks are introduced in a lame attempt to stire the usual formual into something new."
181,blade_trinity,critics,fresh,p,"The surface, the film is stylish without losing its focus, and the gadgets, the settings and the characters all jump to life (as it were) in the cool domain of the extreme scenario."
182,blade_trinity,critics,rotten,n,"An action-packed mess from its lackluster, two-pronged opening segments to its final showdown."
183,blade_trinity,critics,fresh,p,Goyer's film is an entertaining though a hit and miss addition to the franchise.
184,blade_trinity,critics,rotten,n,Are the white movie geeks who make these sci-fi/horror flicks reassuring the white audience by robbing powerful black men of any personality?
185,blade_trinity,critics,rotten,n,"The only one who seems to be having much fun, though, is Parker Posey, camping it up as one of the vampires."
186,blade_trinity,critics,rotten,n,The film adds nothing much that's new to the annals of creative killing in movies. Just run of the mill mass carnage dressed up to project sexiness and swagger.
187,blade_trinity,critics,rotten,n,Chances are that Goyer's cack-handed direction has killed a franchise he helped birth.
188,blade_trinity,critics,rotten,n,"This has all the appeal of reheated, congealed blood."
189,blade_trinity,critics,fresh,p,Out with the old and in with the new.
190,blade_trinity,audience,2.5,n,this is not a good movie but it is a fun movie
191,blade_trinity,audience,2.5,n,"Wesley Snipes' talents as a martial artist not withstanding, a jumbled mess that sometimes feels like the writers had an idea for four different movies but couldn't stretch them out into individual features, so they just mashed them all together."
192,blade_trinity,audience,2.0,n,I really enjoyed the first two but this one misses the mark. The action scenes are lackluster and Ryan Reynolds talks for 80% of the movie with jokes that try way too hard. Jessica Biel barely gets any lines because of it. I did chuckle at Dominic Purcell chewing up the screen though.
193,blade_trinity,audience,3.5,p,This is basically an MCU movie and you can fight me on that.
194,blade_trinity,audience,2.0,n,"This movie starts out as a competent action movie but ends up turning in circles and losing its way. The Dracula thread is fumbled to the point of being boring, which is impressive in its own right but not in a good way. There are some good action scenes, but the second act turnaround feels abrupt and unearned. There's a distinct Joss Whedon knock-off vibe in some of the quirky character concepts, but with no development it falls flat.

Closest comparison: It's like Buffy: The Vampire Slayer by way of Iron Man 2.

Setting: Post-Noir Goth
Plot: Super Hero
Tone: Action"
195,blade_trinity,audience,5.0,p,"The least popular, but I really enjoyed this film, it had the action, but with ryan reynolds and parker posey, it had a really unique feel that wasn't quite as stuffy as the second film seemed to be. I loved it."
196,blade_trinity,audience,3.5,p,This oft panned film is not the disappointment that it’s made out to be. With excellent action scenes and an expanded cast of talented actors and actresses (many that would rise to prominence after 2004) to contrast Blade’s stoic anti-heroism. A fitting conclusion to the the first Marvel superhero trilogy.
197,blade_trinity,audience,1.0,n,I wasn't a fan of the blade films
198,blade_trinity,audience,1.5,n,Blade Trinity is an utter trainwreck. Even Snipes reprising the role he was born for can't elevate this crap. Not worth your time.
199,blade_trinity,audience,1.5,n,Definitely the worst in the series. Felt more like a cash-grab than anything else.

202,max_steel,critics,rotten,n,Max Steel demonstrates a lack of absolute interest towards the public that should be directed. [Full review in Spanish]
203,max_steel,critics,rotten,n,"Max Steel moves in the territories of mediocrity due to irregularities in editing, null creativity to orchestrate entertaining action sequences and exaggerated use of digital effects. [Full review in Spanish]"
204,max_steel,critics,rotten,n,"An artificial and blatant production that lacks of transcendence, which could not even be cataloged as a curiosity. [Full review in Spanish]"
205,max_steel,critics,rotten,n,"Not all toy marketing treatments disguised as movies are terrible; some, such as Transformers, are merely too loud and strident. But few have this movie's lack of imagination, humourlessness and corpse-like pacing."
206,max_steel,critics,rotten,n,This I Was a Teenage Iron Man wannabe is inept at every level.
207,max_steel,critics,rotten,n,The forgettable Max Steels offers a meandering and lifeless superhero origin story.
208,max_steel,critics,rotten,n,Not an abortion. Just a miscarriage.
209,max_steel,critics,rotten,n,I couldn't find a single thing to enjoy here.
210,max_steel,critics,rotten,n,Kids are probably better off playing with the action figures and making up their own stories.
211,max_steel,critics,rotten,n,Toy-based superhero action movie is forgettable.
212,max_steel,critics,rotten,n,"Moviegoers suffering from superhero fatigue should especially avoid Max Steel, a film that embodies the worst of what the genre has to offer."
213,max_steel,critics,rotten,n,Even bored adolescent boys are unlikely to muster any enthusiasm for this chintzy reboot of the hybrid hero.
214,max_steel,critics,rotten,n,A movie based on a toy should be a whole lot more fun than this.
215,max_steel,critics,rotten,n,"A spectacle without the spectacle, an autumnal, amorphous blockbuster that just sits there, suspended in mid-air, as you soak in its ceaseless banality."
216,max_steel,critics,rotten,n,"Given that the character began life as a hunk of plastic with a cool name, it's hardly surprising that writers have reshaped his biography on the fly, with all the consistency of kids playing with their toys in the backyard."
217,max_steel,critics,rotten,n,"What's truly depressing about the whole enterprise is that Garcia and Bello were pulled into it. Yes, actors love to work and bills need to be paid, but perhaps a fund could be started to spare talented thespians this sort of career embarrassment."
218,max_steel,critics,rotten,n,"While the proverbial ""'90s kids"" may get a nostalgic kick out of seeing their old action figures in the flesh, novices are likely to be bored by a movie that feels more like a failed pilot for a TV show."
219,max_steel,critics,rotten,n,"A half-baked, time-wasting curtain-raiser for a superhero franchise that is never, ever going to happen."
220,max_steel,audience,1.5,n,"Well, I gave this movie a try.  It had pretty good special effects for a $10 million dollar funding, it is a shame it's just so confusing and the ending still leaves big holes!"
221,max_steel,audience,5.0,p,"This movie is a must see it absolutely changed my life, full of dramatic action and inspired dialogue don't know why this movie has such a bad score!"
222,max_steel,audience,2.0,n,"I've seen worse, not that that's saying much..."
223,max_steel,audience,4.0,p,Personally I enjoyed it though I haven't watch the series. Plan on catching up on it soon though
224,max_steel,audience,0.5,n,"Sadly, the 0% score comes off as completely warranted with the few good things about it, such as the costume and maybe one or two sincere performances not being of sufficient enough quality to keep me from giving this movie more than half a star. It's dull and repetitive, the lead's dynamic with this robo-alien thingy called Steel is nowhere near as entertaining as, to give an example, Venom & Eddie Brock, it's hard to get immersed in this world when it comes off as depressingly empty, I don't really care about the protagonist's daddy issues and the revelations and, most infamously, there's barely any action in this movie. Which, you know, tend to be the main selling point of a frickin' superhero movie, even in origin stories. Only one proper fight happens and that's near the end with minimal superheroics before that. No saving somebody from getting run over or the hero using some random criminal lowlifes as target practice, just stuff about a psychic connection while the actor screams and keeps telling his crush/girlfriend ""I'm sorry, I have to go"". I'd have hoped that Mattel's attempt to start their own toy-based movie franchise might have been raked over the coals hard by critics but sadly I have to agree that, if it weren't for it being immediately forgotten, lacking anything to help it stand out in a genre that, by the time this movie came out, was understandably being increasingly met with concerns that it would be in danger of getting oversaturated and dying a quiet death at the box office, it could easily have qualified as unequivocally one of the worst superhero movies of all time."
225,max_steel,audience,5.0,p,Good movie personally think needs sequel
226,max_steel,audience,0.5,n,this is so boring and a totally cliche
227,max_steel,audience,3.5,p,"While it's not spectacular, Max Steel is a wholesome, innocent, breezy superhero movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family without any reservation. 

Director Stewart Hendler does the best he can with what he is given; a weak script and a measly $10 million budget. But he crafts a unique, fun origin story that's VERY pretty to look at with his wonderful color grading and cinematography coupled with some very creative sky replacements. 

If there was more faith in this movie and if Stewart Hendler had more resources, better people, and a budget the same size as your average DC or Marvel movie, I truly believe that he would have made the next Hollywood franchise-starter and added another unknown superhero to the public eye."
228,max_steel,audience,0.5,n,"Bereft of characterization or even satisfying rock 'em sock 'em, ""Max Steel"" feels like futzing with an action figure without any childhood imagination."
229,max_steel,audience,3.5,p,I thought it was good overall with an interesting story
0,elektra,critics,rotten,n,The real issue I have with this movie is how uneventful so much of it feels.
1,elektra,critics,fresh,p,The special effects are well realized and enough attention is paid to the character of Elektra to make her a formidable rival to any number of Wolverines.
2,elektra,critics,fresh,p,This movie passes the Bechdel Test and the Knope Friendship Test. It's also way better than it gets credit for.
3,elektra,critics,rotten,n,"Garner, who showed a promising comic touch last year in 13 Going On 30, does her movie career no favors here."
4,elektra,critics,rotten,n,The problem is Elektra is not among the most compelling of characters. She doesn't have enough humanity and the story not enough depth to sustain us between fight scenes.
5,elektra,critics,rotten,n,"If the film isn't as bad as some others in the comics-to-cinema genre (Halle Berry's Catwoman has rather lowered the bar), that's not to say it's good."
6,elektra,critics,fresh,p,Worth a look.
7,elektra,critics,rotten,n,Daredevil's lady friend Elektra gets a solo outing in this insipid action adventure.

13,elektra,critics,rotten,n,There isn't a whisper of spontaneity.
14,elektra,critics,rotten,n,"A curiously ponderous affair, with an excess of pop psychology character background and cod-Eastern mysticism and not enough fun or action."

16,elektra,critics,rotten,n,Violent comic book movie with lingerie costumes.

18,elektra,critics,rotten,n,"An utterly embarrassing misfire with poor performances, contrived elements, and a weak premise."
19,elektra,critics,fresh,p,"Elektra is a strange and emotionally distant picture, redeemed, if not completely, by a nice climactic battle, some moody visuals and a star who seems to be working as hard as she can to heat up a character designed to be chilly."

28,elektra,audience,1.5,n,"While it has solid direction by Rob Bowman (The X-Files, Reign of Fire) a decent score by Christophe Beck (The Seeker: The Dark Is Rising, Little Black Book) and a stand out performance by Terence Stamp there is nothing else good"
29,elektra,audience,1.5,n,"An OCD superhero. Lol. Anyway...Elektra contains some of the worst acting I've seen since a high school play! They say Elektra is a ninja, but I don't know of any ninjas that get their costume at Fredricks of Hollywood. Some of the special effects are good, but the plot is terrible and the acting makes it unbearable. Especially, the kid (played by Kirsten Prout) is supposedly some magickal martial arts prodigy with her dog leash of death (that everyone seems to be able to catch with their hand), but flip flops between screaming Fay Wray and arrogant baby badass. My advice, skip this one, and Jennifer Garner's sai fight with the bedsheets, and pick a real superhero movie. Some say Catwoman and Daredevil are worse. I'm not so sure. Even the music during the credits is bad."

50,judge_dredd,audience,3.5,p,"By the 2080s, much of Earth has become an uninhabitable wasteland. While some humans manage to survive in the barren ""Cursed Earth"", the majority of humanity resides in huge Mega-Cities with populations of tens of millions. To combat crime, the traditional justice system has been replaced by a corps of Judges whose role combines those of police officer, judge, jury, and executioner. In Mega-City One, 2139, Joseph Dredd (Sylvester Stallone), one of the most dedicated ""Street Judges"", assists first-year Judge Barbara Hershey (Diane Lane) in ending a block war. Herman ""Fergee"" Ferguson (Rob Schneider), a hacker recently released from prison, is caught in the firefight and hides inside a food dispensing robot. Dredd arrests Herman for destruction of property, and sentences him to five years' imprisonment. Rico (Armand Assante), a former Judge, escapes from prison with the help of Judge Griffin (Jürgen Prochnow). He returns to Mega-City One and reclaims his uniform and ""Lawgiver"" gun. He also finds and reactivates a decommissioned ABC Warrior combat robot. Vartis Hammond, a news reporter critical of Dredd, is murdered, and Dredd becomes the chief suspect. Dredd is taken to a trial before a tribunal of Council Judges including Griffin and Chief Justice Fargo (Max von Sydow), his mentor. Dredd is found guilty as his DNA is found on the bullets used to kill Hammond (a feature of the Lawgiver is imprinting the user's DNA on each bullet, a fact apparently unknown by most Judges). To save Dredd, Fargo steps down as Chief Justice and, for his last request, asks the Council to spare Dredd's life. Dredd is sentenced to life imprisonment while Fargo embarks on the ""long walk"", in which a retiring Judge ventures into the wasteland ""to bring law to the lawless"". Griffin, who freed Rico to frame Dredd for the murder, becomes Chief Justice and instructs Rico to cause chaos in the city...

Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus is ""Judge Dredd wants to be both a legitimate violent action flick and a parody of one but director Danny Cannon fails to find the necessary balance to make it work."" Gene Siskel named Judge Dredd one of the worst motion pictures of 1995 as part of his 'Worst of 1995' review on Siskel and Ebert. Roger Ebert, in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film 2 out of 4 and wrote: ""Stallone survives it, but his supporting cast, also including an uninvolved Joan Chen and a tremendously intense Jurgen Prochnow, isn't well used."" Todd McCarthy of Variety called it ""A thunderous, unoriginal futuristic hardware show for teenage boys."" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave it a grade of C+ and wrote: ""The movie, by the end, practically seems intent on destroying itself."" Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader gave a negative review: ""Directed without inspiration by Danny Cannon from a stupid script by Michael De Luca, William Wisher, and Steven de Souza."" Caryn James of the New York Times wrote: ""Although it is full of noise and fake firepower, Dredd simply lies there on the screen until the final scenes."" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film 1 out of 4, and wrote: ""Usually engaging and sympathetic, Stallone is blank and tongue-tied here, an immovable slab in the midst of 95 minutes of gunfire, explosions and Gothic excess."" Rita Kempley of the Washington Post wrote: ""Aside from the affable Schneider and the able Lane, the cast seems to be in deep shock. Um, make that Dredd lock."" James Berardinelli of ReelViews wrote: ""Sometimes, it's rather amusing, but it's impossible to decide whether this is accidental or on purpose."" In a 2017 retrospective review Richard Trenholm from CNET wrote that the film ""drew more more shrewdly on the comic's abundant history than the 2012 version"" and ""absolutely nailed the look of Mega City One"". Trenholm noted that ""sets, costumes and vehicles were fantastic"", while ""looming ABC warrior and grotesque Angel Gang"" were ""both triumphs of pre-CGI physical effects"". In 2020, on the 25th Anniversary of the film, Drew Dietsch of Giant Freakin Robot praised the surface elements of the film ""As a piece of pure production, Judge Dredd needs to be heralded as one of the best achievements of the '90s. Everything about the film's texture is a resounding success.""

Reviewers criticized ""Judge Dredd"" for its script and perceived lack of originality and faith to its source material, along with Stallone's acting. The film is often considered to be one of Stallone's worst films, but its visual style, effects, music score, stunts and action sequences were praised, and the film was nominated for four Saturn Awards. Danny Cannon´s movie version of the 2000 AD comic is pretty ok to my mind I must say despite the negative criticism. Stallone is ok as Judge Dredd to a certain extent (even if he takes off the helmet), the lovely Diane Lane is solid as Judge Hershey, Armand Assante evil as Rico and it´s always a treat to see Max von Sydow (rest his soul). The sets of Mega City One are great in my book (that took a year to build), The Judge´s guns, uniforms and bikes are great as well, while the effects are a bit wobbly. I think that the story has flaws, why add Rob Schneider´s annoying Herman ""Fergee"" Ferguson as some sort of sidekick for example, but it´s not all bad which John Wagner, the creator of Judge Dredd thought. It´s clear that ""Judge Dredd"" has certain pluses and minuses and the same goes for the 2012 ""Dredd"" version. However, I am still hoping that Karl Urban will return as Judge Dredd with a script based on the Dark Judges... 

Trivia: Prior to the film's world premiere on 30 June 1995, Judge Dredd had to be re-cut and submitted to the MPAA five times in order to get it down from a NC-17 to a R rating. This was before Stallone and the studio tried to cut the film even further to get a PG-13 rating. Director Danny Cannon was so disheartened over the constant creative disputes with Stallone that he swore he would never again work with another big-name actor. He also stated that the final version was completely different from the script due to the creative changes demanded by Stallone. In later interviews, Stallone said he thought the film was supposed to be an action comedy film so demanded rewrites to make it more comedic. The director and screenwriter had a darker, more satirical vision. Several entire sequences were deleted from the theatrical release to reduce the violence and darker tone of the film. For example, a scene where Rico kills news reporter Hammond and his wife was originally longer and bloodier because it showed them getting hit by bullets in slow-motion. Likewise the ABC Warrior robot was to kill Judge Griffin by ripping his arms and legs off but this was also changed. Cannon wanted more violence (because it was in keeping with the comic's source material) but the studio and Stallone wanted a PG-13 movie with more focus on humour. Even the film's climax was deleted, scenes showing Dredd fighting and killing clone Judges was removed prior to the theatrical release. Some promotional stills were published in Judge Dredd Megazine showing Dredd shooting one of the clones. John Wagner, the creator of the comic character on which the film was based, said when interviewed by Empire in 2012: ""the story had nothing to do with Judge Dredd, and Judge Dredd wasn't really Judge Dredd."" Wagner said it was a pity the way the film turned out, since the production values were great, and they had the budget for it. In an interview with Total Film magazine, he said the film had ""told the wrong story"" because it ""tried to do too much""."
51,judge_dredd,audience,2.0,n,"If you know nothing about the ultra violent comic book it was based on, you might get some mild satisfaction with a cheesy Stallone sci-fi cop movie.  If you were familiar, then you'll hate it.  But the original comic book (published in the UK) was meant to be a stealth parody of American movies where cops go vigilante, so by making a borderline parody it's actually staying true to the source material."

56,judge_dredd,audience,5.0,p,"After watching Dredd (2012) first and hating it. I had to see the original. 
Boy was I surprised. This is exactly what I'm looking for in a 90s action/sci fi/futuristic/love story. The twists. The villains motivation. The comedy. The special effects. It all fit perfectly. Down to the soundtrack!"
57,judge_dredd,audience,5.0,p,Wow what a great movie
58,judge_dredd,audience,2.0,n,"I love, I mean really love the Dredd comic.

This movie is what happens when a ""run of the mill"" Hollywood studio with people that have no interest in the lore (excuse the pun) of what they invested in tries to make a comic book movie.

They ignored everything that makes the comic great."
59,judge_dredd,audience,5.0,p,A great take on the story. Maybe a little too much licence taken with Judge Dredd himself. But otherwise a well rounded movie.
60,league_of_extraordinary_gentlemen,critics,fresh,p,Your enjoyment of this fascinatingly flawed action-adventure fantasy will come down to how far you are prepared to go along with its original and absolutely off-the-wall premise.
61,league_of_extraordinary_gentlemen,critics,rotten,n,Appallingly stupid and incompetently made.
62,league_of_extraordinary_gentlemen,critics,fresh,p,"It's big, silly, and entertaining, and even its most naked franchise ambitions feel fun rather than frustrating, because they're so blatant."

64,league_of_extraordinary_gentlemen,critics,rotten,n,"Sadly, the rot sets in just over the halfway mark when the action loses its identity of fustian heroism and degenerates into another arcade video game of mundane destruction. A pity."

75,league_of_extraordinary_gentlemen,critics,rotten,n,"No matter how troubled the shoot was, the movie was shanghaied from the off, courtesy of Hollywood's dependence on market-defined 'success'."

And even sadder that i can't even give them credit for the idea's creativity because the idea was made by someone else, and delivered by them (Alan More) in such a more interesting, witty and entertaining way. The script is cringy at best and embarrassing at worst and of course i am legally obligated to mention the ‘i hoped to nail you one more time' Dorian Grey line before i say anymore. Character wise? Oh my god this movie wastes some of LITERALLY the best characters in fiction to make the most obvious dumb incarnations i have ever seen, examples being Jakkles and Hyde being an extremely poorly rendered hulk rip off with some kind of serum he could totally stop taking if he wanted to, and Dorian Grey being so dumb that he chooses to look at his own painting despite his entire twist villianious motivation being ‘i want to liv 4ever bitches'. Not only do they use the ideas and characters that they were so graciously bestowed with badly but they decide to mishandle the action poorly as well. As someone who didn't know who many of these people were going in (cos i was 11) i suppose i was surprised when Dorian was immortal but non of the other millions of twists it insisted on throwing in are at all well done or shocking. The fight and chase scenes are dark (not like metaphorically, in a Zak Snyder way) and they are either too short or too long and don't actually involve much fighting, more just running and not dying with an embarrassing snappy comeback at the end. What a weird, embarrassing clusterfudge."

112,ghost_rider,audience,5.0,p,"Ghost Rider tem um enredo raso porém coerente com o personagem Johnny Blaze interpretado por Nicolas Cage, que não combinou com o papel, mas sua atuação é razoável, aliás o resto do elenco pode ser dito da mesma forma, salva as boas exceções do ator, Sam Elliott e Peter Fonda. Pontos Negativos: duração do filme, como estamos tratando de uma história de origem, é normal passar das 2h, porém nesse caso optamos por algo mais rápido. Cenas de lutas, deixou muito a desejar, foram tão rápidas que nenhum vilão é memorável. O Johnny Blaze apareceu muito mais que o Ghost Rider, deixando que o filme foque mais na relação amorosa (sem sal ) entre ele e a Roxanne. ​ Pontos Positivos: Ambientação, o filme se passa no Texas, que foi uma sacada inteligente por conta da estética que o Ant. Herói apresenta. CGI, os efeitos especiais estão impecáveis, o crânio esta foto realista junto com as chamas bem desenhadas. Trilha Sonora, a sonoplastia do filme condiz com estilo de Ghost Rider, tanto em sua voz quanto as músicas do fundo.

What was wrong with it? Everything. ""Batman"" may supposed to be dark, but there was too much darkness in this one. Contrast does help keep one's interest, and Batman doesn't absolutely require darkness to be successful, as you might guess if you've seen the other movies, comics, etc.

The heroes are bad. The interaction between the title characters doesn't come off properly. The villains are worse. The police tell Batman about the new villain, Mr. Freeze. (Huh? Batman is supposed to be the great detective who knows everything before anyone else does!) And Arnold Schwarzenegger was as suitable for the character as Danny DeVito would be to play Marilyn Monroe. The female villain stinks too.

It's hard to describe more; I fell asleep because everything was done so badly. I wouldn't be surprised if everyone wasn't sleeping themselves when they were making this movie."
143,1077027-batman_and_robin,audience,1.0,n,"While ""Forever"" tried to strike a balance, here all subtlety is chopped into confetti and shout out of a cannon.  Did almost irreparable damage to Joel Schumacher's career.  Horribly miscast, and even more poorly written.  Bane is a meant to be a genius tactician IN ADDITION TO having a superhuman physique, not some mindless henchman.  At least they cast someone realistically looks like he could snap a man's spine without trying.  Mister Freeze deserves to be played by a dramatic thespian like Patrick Stewart or Anthony Hopkins."
144,1077027-batman_and_robin,audience,1.5,n,"I don't mind the more colorful presentation contrasting the Burton entries, as I thought it worked extremely well with Batman Forever - instead I think Batman and Robin is just lame and braindead.  Batman Forever smartly incorporated actual moments of levity into itself, which the Burton entries (particularly the turgid second one) completely lacked, and juggled it with the already established dark tone.  This drops the dark tone completely (except for the production design, which is colorful as hell but still effectively gothic), and amps up the levity to the point that this often times feels more like an outright comedy than a superhero movie.  Now, some have said that this was to reflect the Adam West Batman era, but the Adam West era was not only a lot funnier, it also told wackier stories; this feels very much in line with the three preceding Batman films in terms of story, particularly the enemy's motivations, but presents it as almost nothing but a constant series of jokes.  And very, very few of the jokes are actually funny - I say no hyperbole when I say that the ""I'll get drive-thru"" joke that kicked off Batman Forever was considerably funnier than anything in this entire movie!  So when you've got a comedy with almost no funny jokes, what else do you have?  Well, not much.  The action is overall mildly competent, but average is the best I can call it, and the performances range from trying to play it ultra-straight to CONSTANTLY winking to the camera.  Rule for aspiring comic writers:  You can present your comedy with a wink, or completely straight-faced, but you can't do both at the same time!  Visually, at least, the movie looks pretty great at times -- I like the use of shadows, bright colors, and I really dig the giant bronze statues all over Gotham, as if there were a bunch of frozen Greek gods standing around.  Artistically the movie is very solid in the large-scale elements, and the CGI was actually very good for its day, at least for the most part.  But these are not a reason to go back and watch it in hopes of a quality movie.  This should really only be watched as a novelty of intriguing (and probably well-natured) intentions failing to execute."
145,1077027-batman_and_robin,audience,4.0,p,"I enjoyed this movie. I like it because of the campiness, which I get isn't for everyone. One thing that I think is really good about this movie is that it emphasizes with the lighting and the architecture and the world building that Gotham is not a part of our world. Too often in superhero movies the writers and directors go out of their way to set these incredible battles and otherworldly beings and fantastical places in our world. Batman & Robin didn't do that, it was obvious throughout that this was not our world, not our reality, and I think the campiness goes hand in hand with that. 
What I love the most about this movie, though, is the representation of Batman.  He's soft spoken, he's fairly well adjusted, he's patient, and he's kind. To me, that's who Batman is."
146,1077027-batman_and_robin,audience,3.5,p,"Joel Schumacher's Batman and Robin is unabashedly cartoonish throughout, and for that reason it probably alienates a lot of diehard Batman fans. Add in the unpopular casting of George Clooney as the Caped Crusader, and you have a recipe for the series taking a lengthy hiatus immediately after this film's release.

But at its heart, the movie delivers exactly what it sets out to accomplish, buoyed by a couple of spry performances, a phantasmagoria of costumes and decorations, and a one-note script that rarely strays from the 1960s show it means to honor.

Following the enormous success of Batman in 1989, Tim Burton dialed up the darkness to 10 for his follow-up, Batman Returns. That effort proved uneven, though, and paved the way for a new direction in the franchise. Enter Schumacher, who helmed both Batman Forever and this film. 

Here he takes Batman to the cartooniest extreme, which perfectly suits the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze and Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy, the film's main villains. 

Schwarzenegger's Freeze, confined to a suit that regulates his temperature, hardly has a line that doesn't make a pun on the cold, while Thurman is game as the botanist turned evildoer Poison Ivy. The two make an odd pairing, but they lend the film ample energy.

Ivy's powers, which mostly involve spraying a neverending supply of pheromone that turns men into easily manipulated puppets, are not fully explained. Still, Thurman doesn't back down from the chance to play a bitter scientist-turned-supervillain whose theories were laughed at by Gotham's powers that be. She successfully avoids over-sexualizing the character and is believably bitter toward the establishment.

On the other hand, Bane is an unwieldy presence in the film, depicted here as an unholy Frankenstein's monster who's brought to life by a mad scientist trying to create a breed of super soldiers for sale. Rather than the intellectual giant of the comics, this incarnation of Bane is a mindless ape doing Poison Ivy's bidding for much of the film. Besides helping to overrun some of Gotham's finest, his role is largely unnecessary. 

Ditto that of Alicia Silverstone's Batgirl, especially given that Batman is already aided by the acrobatic Robin, played by Chris O'Donnell. O'Donnell makes for a serviceable sidekick, eager if slightly petulant. The very inclusion of Robin gives the film a unique dimension that doesn't appear elsewhere in the modern Batman movies.

Silverstone was still fresh off the massive success of Clueless, a movie that was likely her peak. Her acting chops have never been notable, and while this movie isn't leaning on the strength of its performances, she fits into the story in no more than an awkward, ancillary way. Having the Dynamic Duo take on Freeze and Poison Ivy would have been enough without throwing in the others.

The choice of Clooney as Batman is understandably controversial. He is stiff in the Batsuit and feels offkey in his scenes as Bruce Wayne. Whereas Thurman and Schwarzenegger lean into the film's corny tone, Clooney looks embarrassed and too cool for the role. And when it came time to dress Bruce Wayne, the costumers that went the extra mile on the rest of the cast suddenly ran out of ideas. Instead, we're forced to look at Wayne sporting a black dad hoodie and black dad robe. 

The myriad of sets are a garish palette of colors, a kaleidoscopic collision reminiscent of a child's first foray into finger painting. Still, the sheer volume of props and effects are remarkable, offering plenty to ogle for multiple viewings. There's nods to Mad Max, A Clockwork Orange, and Little Shop of Horrors, and yes, an overabundance of neon.

No scene is complete without an excess of characters and their multitude of props. This asthetic is embodied by a mid-film motorcycle race that does nothing for the plot but still manages to feature a Coolio cameo, several random explosions, most of the extras from Mad Max, a green fire, and Robin making a physics-defying grab to save Batgirl's life.

The script is filled with a seemingly neverending stream of puns, corny jokes, cheeky sexual innuendos, and cringe worthy one-liners. As such, it pays homage to the 1960s Batman live action TV show that so many grew up watching after school. The commitment to this feel must have been an enormous writing challenge, although that fact alone does not make the script particularly engaging. 

While the Adam West scripts needed to fill only a 40-minute story, typically spread across a two-part show, this movie runs well over two hours. Along the way, the viewer is left a bit numb by the silliness of the humor. The best scenes are the ones that rely on minimal dialogue, notably a battle on ice skates between Batman and Robin and Mr. Freeze's minions that's set in a museum. It's here that we're introduced to Schwarzenegger's heavily shellacked and thickly accented bad guy, as he riffs on the defining feature of his character: the cold. 

Because of the script's devotion to puny humor, the plot points that do arise all get glossed over. We have references to Mr. Freeze trying to save his wife from dying of a rare disease, Alfred having a similar rare disease, concerns about environmental destruction, unethical scientists creating terrible human experiments, Bruce Wayne being afraid of romantic commitment, Batman being afraid of collegial commitment, Batgirl wanting to find a cure to save Alfred and lift him from his servitude in Wayne Manner, and even a jealous Poison Ivy deceiving Mr. Freeze while attempting to kill his wife. But none of this feels like it matters much in the big scheme of things, as long as Arnold can belt out another corny joke about the need to chill while pointing his gun at a crowd. 

The one interesting subplot focusing on whether Batman can truly trust Robin as his partner is largely dismissed and not fleshed out. In a different movie, that could have been a theme to build on, one that would either end in a uniquely strong bond or in an ongoing conflict, perhaps even pushing Robin into his own solo crime fighting career. The latter idea was brought to great life in a comic series where Robin adopts the identity of Nightwing. But here the writers are dedicated to a singular vision of what the live-action TV show provided, and they remain faithful to the camp for which the show was famous. 

One thing to appreciate about Batman and Robin is that it sets the stage for Christopher Nolan's superb trilogy. Of course, the reason is that this movie essentially killed the series. But it does so by swinging the pendulum for the tone of Batman so far the other way from Burton's films that it left the studio almost nowhere to go. By 1997, the world had four Batman films in an 8-year span, and they had seen most of the major characters, both hero and villain.

They had also seen the extremes of what a Batman film could be in terms of mood and atmosphere. Thus, into the deep freeze with the series until Nolan thawed it out eight years later with Batman Begins. Had the franchise limped along with a handful of mediocre films in the ensuing years, Nolan may never have had the chance to develop his own vision.

In all, Batman and Robin has lots of nonsense, an inflated budget for huge set pieces, the (purposefully) cheesiest script ever seen in a superhero movie, and of course the ending you expected. But with the right attitude going in, this can prove to be an enjoyable, if cringey, watch."

This time George Clooney suits up as the caped crusader, but makes the same mistakes as Kilmer did with Batman Forever, failing to find a new take on the character. Chris O'Donnell returns as Dick Grayson aka Robin, and puts in another solid performance, but Alicia Silverstone seems miscast as Batgirl. This movie's double villains are by far the worst to date: Uma Thurman is weak as ""Poison Ivy"", and Arnold Schwarzenegger is comical as ""Mr Freeze"", the only role where is Austrian accent is just annoying. Schumacher's direction is once again hammy, and the script fails to deliver any memorable moments.

I liked Annabeth Gish's character... the disabled former soldier tech wiz that helps Shaq out.. she does her best with that part and it was rare back in those days to see a disabled character with a key role in a

178,1078035-steel,audience,0.5,n,"The first black superhero movie...quite a bumpy beginning especially since we got Blade - the movie that birthed the modern superhero craze - barely a year later. Is this movie so bad that it borders back to being good? Yes. Substandard fight scenes and production values on par with made-for-TV movies are one thing. But there's the horrendous acting, ignorance of source material and woefully miscast Shaq. Even if it was a more respected actor, I'd still find it hard to take anybody wallking around an unconvincing rubber suit seriously. And given that he's the tallest member in the cast, he seems quite out-of-place what with scenes where comparatively small gangsters laugh at and taunt him whereas I'd probably figure it best not to get on his bad side. The only good thing the movie had going for it is its theme, that's it. And even then, it's still not enough to warrant me bumping the rating up to 1 star. I wish I could rant more about the movie but does it really mattee? I'll just forget about the movie as soon as I submit this review anyway. So...this movie is entertaining in a horrendous way."

Oh also it sucks."

Another of Jeffrey Jones finest portrayals oozing conviction; his acting hold the 2nd and third acts together.  Tim Robbins is wonderfully animated.  
In both my 1986 viewing and in 2021 the film has a sincere and expansive Joe Campbell Heroes Journey theme which I really appreciated.    In both 1986 and 2021 viewings I felt critics who hated it were people at war against their own imagination, unable to suspend disbelief for any reason.

Why a self-absorbed asshole would care about being alone at Christmas seems to be the major flaw in the plot.  But once you get in to it, it isn't awful.  It isn't laugh a minute, but it has a few laughs.  Cast is pretty strong.  Affleck specifically REALLY seems to get in to this - like he is on speed or something.  But this is still WAY better than most any other Christmas based rom-com."

You ever watch an actor in a movie and think to yourself, ""does this person even know they are in a movie?!"" Because clearly thats just who they are as a person! I feel like no one told Ben Affleck they were filming him, thats just where he was at in life. 
Christina Applegate as the hot girl who is also an asshole? My God the range on that one! You throw in a cheapskate Papa and a master-bating little brother and you got yourself a Christmas! If i knew that with a little money you could rent yourself a Dad, i would probably be a lot more successful in life! 
If ‘Indecent Proposal' and ‘Its a Wonderful Life' had a baby, it would be this movie. So sick back, kick your feet up, and give it a go!"

It is not nearly as bad as it is made out to be . Give it a chance

The story follows several New Yorkers on Christmas Eve as they cross paths and struggle to come to terms with their personal struggles.  Starring Susan Sarandon, Penélope Cruz, Paul Walker, Alan Arkin, and Robin Williams, the film features an impressive cast that delivers some strong performances.  And the writers do a fairly good job at balancing the different character stories.  Still, it gets a little cliché at times and a bit contrived.  Yet despite its flaws, Noel is a heartwarming film about the redemptive nature of Christmas."

87,deck_the_halls,audience,3.0,p,"Stupid, whacky and bonkers... yet enjoyable. I found 'Deck the Halls' fun.

Danny DeVito is the film's star, no question. If it wasn't for him I'd potentially be rating this lower, I admit. He gives an amusing performance, while the hearty stuff directly with him works. Matthew Broderick is a little forgettable here but still produces a good display. Kristin Chenoweth is probably the best of the rest, but it's all about DeVito in truth.

I mentioned the heart works with the aforementioned actor, but elsewhere it's a a bit hit-and-miss. The final scene, that Chenoweth plays a part in, is very iffy - could've went either way, I just about liked it though. The humour is good, as is the plot - as silly as it is. I also really enjoyed how they did the lights.

I got entertainment from this."
88,deck_the_halls,audience,0.5,n,"this film isn't even much of a film, as that would suggest at something with an actual plot, which this movie does not have. the entire premise of the movie is that Danny Devito (i already forgot the characters name) wants his house covered in christmas lights to be seen from space. why does he want this? the movie sure doesn't know, it just randomly gets brought up after he looks at some satellite images. and the ending is one of the most cliche, corny, sappy, stupid ending to a christmas movie you could imagine. there isn't a single redeeming quality to this movie in my opinion."
89,deck_the_halls,audience,1.5,n,I like Matthew Broderick. I like Danny DeVito. I like Kristin Davis and Kristin Chenoweth. I do NOT like Deck the Halls. This movie is absolutely absurd and completely predictable. The plot is so disjointed and the characters are so inconsistent that it feels like a new team of writers was brought in for each scene after the old team was fired. It's almost impressive how unfunny this attempt at a Christmas comedy is.

114,santa_claus_the_movie,audience,3.0,p,"Nice film, I found enough enjoyment with it.

Probably not as deep or creative as it could've been, but I do like the plot of 'Santa Claus: The Movie' as it starts off at the embryonic stages of Santa. It ends up turning into a run-of-the-mill good v. bad thing, but that cause is helped by the casting of John Lithgow - who is entertaining.

Lithgow isn't the only positive cast, as Dudley Moore and David Huddleston do solid things too. It's interesting to see that Lithgow doesn't rate this, as well as the fact that it's apparently popular in the UK; though I, as a Englishman, had never heard about this before this year to be honest.

There are, at least in my opinion, many better festive films out there, but this 1985 flick is a satisfying Xmas watch. It's cheesy and features some questionable special effects, but does have pleasant-looking reindeer and has charm."
115,santa_claus_the_movie,audience,5.0,p,One if my favourite Christmas movies that I watch every year!
116,santa_claus_the_movie,audience,5.0,p,This is the best Santa Clause movie I've seen.
117,santa_claus_the_movie,audience,3.0,p,"I think the message of the movie was lost on the producers of this film but then I don't know if this film actually has a message. In many ways, the same greed that motivates the wonderfully hammy, corporate, villain played by John Lithgow, is the same greed that made this film.  The producers of Superman were out for the next legendary character to milk and this time their hero was a jolly old elf who belonged to the public domain.  SANTA CLAUS.  And how best to make a movie about Santa Claus?  Not through a well-crafted story or character development. No, but through casting, set designs, costumes, and special effects.  Now it sounds like I'm putting this film down but here is the thing they do the stuff that sells the secularization of Santa and Christmas really, really well.  Its a colorful, whimsical, magical and it doesn't look cheap.  I can only say that as a 9-year old boy I ate this film up, even though by that time I knew the big lie that was the commercial Santa. The film is an oversized sugar-coated candy lollipop, it's the flashy paper wrapping around a well-meant gift and as such it's disposable.  It's nice and Santa is certainly a warm, virtuous character that easy to love but just like the Santa at the mall, the movie is fake and meant for kids...but parents and the nostalgic might secretly enjoy it too."
118,santa_claus_the_movie,audience,5.0,p,"I love this movie.  It captures the imagination in a believable fashion.  For the 1980's, the special effects are captivating, the story is believable, and the acting which employs Dudley Moore, John Lithgow, and David Huddleston is stellar.  The story which first tells the story of the beginning of Santa Claus, and ends with an elf leaving for New York City. Love, love, love this movie and am amazed that people don't like it. Lithgow is hilarious and simply the best antagonist in any Christmas movie."

In such a state of disbelief was I, I joined Rotten Tomatoes in order to leave my first ever review. 

I felt that this movie was extremely moving. It offers a rich and intimate look into the lives of various family members as they engage in or experience the complexities of life. The movie reflects its message. There are tears of many kinds, as well as laughs. 

The ending is neither here nor there - the journey is the reward. For a reviewer to disregard what the movie offers on the basis that the narrator is a dog is cynical and undermining to the richness of her own experience."

Tacky, unfunny, pretentious, and overall just horribly written. All of the A-Listers in Hollywood couldn't carry the absolute embarrassment that is this movie. The characters are unlikeable and bizarre, and the plot is more shallow than a kiddie pool. It makes the most feeble attempt at portraying real interfamilial & personal issues (divorce, sibling rivalry, widowing, etc.) with all the character depth of a Target commercial. Feels like a wannabe Love Actually, but stripped of the wit, humour, complexity, romance, and wonder. An utterly joyless holiday film."

There really is no redeeming factor of this movie, and even the villains are just too goofy for this film. Overall, there isn't much else to say except that this film was just not very good or memorable, which (considering it is a ""Home Alone"" movie) just makes this all the more worse."
202,home_alone_3,audience,3.0,p,"[⭐️64%]

Expectations were low going into Home Alone 3 (1997) as it didn't bring back Macaulay Culkin and it was initially a concept which didn't lend itself to a franchise, however this direct-to-video sequel managed exceed expectations. It is by no means on par with the original but Home Alone 3 (1997) doesn't completely rehash the formula like Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992) had done. It was going in a solid direction until the story unfolded and got goofy. Yes this franchise is intended for a young audience but there were still moments for adults to enjoy, however here it is filled with slapstick which will entertain kids, but probably not adults.

At the end of the day Home Alone 3 (1997) is a sequel which never needed to happen, just like all of the Home Alone sequels however it is harmless and isn't ridiculously bad like imagined."
203,home_alone_3,audience,2.5,n,"The charm of Home Alone 1&2 was that there was a boy who was scared yet resourceful, taking on two petty thieves who were bumbling idiots. It was only slightly far fetched. Home Alone 3 was simply unbelievable. International spies who had evaded the authorities for decades get outsmarted by a kid and a parrot that were both too competent to be credible. The antics were funny though."
204,home_alone_3,audience,2.0,n,Home Alone 3 is really nothing special. It lacks much needed good action and replaces it with nothing more than child comedy which doesn’t get by well with most people. I would recommend watching the first one again if you haven’t seen it already.

23,christmas_with_the_kranks,audience,0.5,n,"A Christmas movie only rich people will relate to, when they said they had spent $6,000 the previous year and that they need to donate $600 towards some charitable causes I felt myself sigh out loud. Christmas films are supposed to be feel good, but this film was cheesy and all the characters felt entitled and over privileged, nothing feel good about that at all, missed the mark by a long shot when they made this and hasn't aged well for this reason."
24,christmas_with_the_kranks,audience,5.0,p,the Christmas atmosphere in this movie is one of my favorites.
25,christmas_with_the_kranks,audience,3.0,p,They can't all be Home Alone or Christmas Vacation but for what it is it's fine. I'm critical of movies but despite the fact that this is far from Oscar worthy it's a cheap Christmas movie with some laughs and a touching ending. What else do these people with negative reviews want??
26,christmas_with_the_kranks,audience,5.0,p,Best Christmas movie out there!! Can't go a year without watching it! Perfect holiday family movie!!
27,christmas_with_the_kranks,audience,4.0,p,"I don't understand all of the hate. It's funny and I loved the performances of Tim Allen, Jamie Lee Curtis and Dan Aykroyd. This is one of my must watch Christmas movies every year. Don't listen to the critics and give it a try for yourself."
28,christmas_with_the_kranks,audience,5.0,p,"Hilarious, great cast, fun plot. Deserves way more love!"
29,christmas_with_the_kranks,audience,5.0,p,"This movie is awesome! It's a perfect movie for its genre. I repeat for its genre. Not every movie should be compared to Citizen Kane. Citizen Kane is a drama, this is a family comedy. Judge it by family comedy standards. Which I will. A- It's about a husband and a wife trying to get away for the holidays and their overbearing neighbors and friends do not want them to skip Christmas. Then the hilarious high jinks commence. B- It's funny; most noticeablely Tim Allen's and Dan Aykroyd characters. C- The main charcter has a complete story arc and the ending is great. 
I connect most to movies where the charcters remind me of my family, friends or someone I know personally. Tim Allen's charcter of Mr. Krank reminds me a lot of my dad. My dad really gets excited for vacations. We even joke in our family when my parents are about to leave for a trip, he goes into vacation mode. Luther Krank definitely goes into vacation mode in this movie, and it really is entertaining. From his spray tan debauchel at the mall with his wife. To his botox injection scene where he can't feel his face. Luther is assertive like my dad and the social jousting between him and Dan Aykroyd's character Vic Frohmeyer is entertaining and comedy gold. The movie is heart warming too. When Luther and Nora Krank hear their daughter and boyfriend are coming home for Christmas, they (I mean Nora, Luther's wife) decides to stay home and plan the annual Krank's Christmas party last minute for Blaire their daughter, instead of going on the cruise. The clock is running as Luther is in charge of getting a Christmas tree and Nora tries to get her famous honey baked ham from the store (as she doesn't have time to cook one.) The Krank's are running into humorous obstacles all along the way until finally Vic shows his good heart and steps in and gathers up all the neighbors to come to the Krank's Christmas party and chip in to help set up and bring food over. At the end of the party Luther is sulking because his vacation is ruined. I can really relate to that scene and I really enjoy relatable emotions like that in movies, and I think most people would be self-pitying, if they had been planning a vacation for as long as Luther has, longer than his daughter and new finace have been together as he sarcasticlly says at one point. But the movie ends with Luther being the good man and offering the cruise to an old grumphy neighbor and his wife. Luther doesn't much care for the old man, in fact he often gets into it with him. But Luther likes his wife and he turns the other cheek and gives the cruise package, all inclusive and paid in full to the old couple. After some prodding by Luther they finally and happily accept. It's a good movie, check it out, just because it has a 5% rating doesn't mean it's bad. Plenty of movies have been criticized and wrote off at first, then praised later. But you say it came out in 2004? Well, this is one of the few good reviews of this movie and I hope it encourages you to see it. Maybe after you do you'll like it and recommend it to. I know I did."

Some of negative reviews are absolute eye rollers .. if you can't laugh at the church scene, it probably hits a little too close for comfort, or you are a joyless sack.  We watch this every Christmas as a family and it never gets old."
85,four_christmases,audience,2.5,n,An over the top comedy with an all star cast.  Vince was his usual fast talking mumbling self.  Reese was charming enough in her roll.  Don't expect much from this comedy.  I've seen better
86,four_christmases,audience,3.5,p,"Four Christmases is a unique Christmas tale in which a couple, both having divorced parents, go to their own parent's Christmases and their partner's parents. The film starts out strong with a comedic first Christmas in which Vince Vaughn is abused by his dad and brothers and ends up setting the floor on fire. Next, we are taken to Reese Witherspoon's mom's house. Vaughn and Witherspoon recreate the birth of Jesus at her mom's cult-like church and then Witherspoon's family fawn over Vaughn. After these two Christmases, I think the movie takes a turn in the wrong direction. We are taken to Vaughn's mom and her partner, who happens to be a childhood friend of Vaughn. This was comical, but compared to the last two Christmases we visited, it just simply wasn't as comical. On the way to the last Christmas, Vaughn and Witherspoon get into a fight. This causes them to have a realization that maybe they don't want to be together, so Witherspoon goes to her dad's Christmas alone. This Christmas is wholesome and quite boring. Sometime while Witherspoon is at her dad's Christmas, Vaughn has a realization that he loves Witherspoon too much to let his opinions get in the way and they get back together. This last Christmas is the worst. Sitting down to watch this movie I was thinking that I was going to get comedy all the way through. I wasn't looking for a romantic ending, which is fine, but just not what I expected."

While the two unironic redeeming qualities this B-movie has are the Martians' costume design and the sincerity the actor playing Santa brings to the character, everything else...

Plus at several parts you can literally hear the set crew laughing, like after someone says something about the smokestack of the queen elizabeth. It wasn't even funny!!!! Most of the time I forget this is even supposed to be a christmas movie!!!it has absolutely NOTHING to do with christmas except that it has santa claus in it.

While I like watching Vince Vaughn beat up Santa Claus as much as the next person, I'm not a big Vince Vaughn fan.  I'd rather see what Paul Giamotti can do with the Santa role, honestly.

Kevin Spacey, being very much himself, is awful, or his character is, and a story needs a good villain.  Being a whiny spoiled kid in an adult body doesn't really do it for me, especially in a Santa setting."

173,the_christmas_candle_2013,audience,3.0,p,Nice Faith-based Christmas story that helps to inspire during difficult times no matter what they are and bring families together
174,the_christmas_candle_2013,audience,4.0,p,"I've seen many ""heartwarming"" Christmas movies that all begin and end the same way - a Christmas grouch believes in Christmas and finds romance. But this movie is different. I found myself completely charmed by the quaint English town setting and the colorful array of characters. 

The plot focuses on a kind, young minister who is recruited to replace the former pastor of Gladbury. When he arrives he is dismayed to find that the townspeople eagerly await an angelic visitation to their prayers by touching a candle rather than focusing on ""good works."" He sets out to prove that his way of offering practical help is better than an angel blessing one candle. Now it is a bit strange than a man of God would go out of his way to disprove simple faith but it is a Christmas movie so bear with me.

The story was written by Max Lucado, a very kind and soft-spoken Christian pastor and songwriter, so there is a sense of supernatural awe as the townspeople put a little more action behind their prayers which helps everyone receive a special miracle. 

But things go awry when the pastor also tries to do away with all candles by ordering electricity for the church and nearly burning it down. In the aftermath, he then has to confront his own lack of faith and overzealousness for good works which comes out of a misguided reaction to personal tragedy.

His subsequent attempts to make amends abuts with the town candlemaker, who he nearly ran out of business, and is the only person to have ever seen the Christmas Angel. He also runs afoul of the town's local atheist, a pretty lady whose father is very ill and becomes the reverend's confidant and love interest, adding for a sexy twist! 

This completely charming story is mostly well-developed although there are one or two loose ends that didn't quite make sense. But the rest of the story is so well-acted and brimming with hope that I can overlook those.

The movie isn't just about belief or unbelief, It's about modernity and tradition and does make one wish for a simple village where neighbors fix each other's broken roofs and lives simply because they care. 

A great story that easily stands out from the pack of standard Christmas movies."

It must be hard to write, act and/or direct a character like that and make them someone the audience will cheer for. This movie doesn't make that possible as Thomas' character is manipulating, stealing and lying the whole way to New York only to seem to change at the end of the movie. Which could still be manipulation on his part. I think this movie would have been better if the main character had slowly changed over the course of his travels and then noticed people helping him willingly to get home because of his actions toward them. But as is, this movie has a few laughable gags and might be worth a watch if you need a Christmas movie fix fulfilled."

Jonathan Taylor Thomas is the lead of 'I'll Be Home for Christmas' and he's pretty good, especially at playing the cocky school kid. I feel his arc is satisfactory, though it would've been nice if there was a longer spell of him realising/correcting his behaviour.

Still, I feel there's enough in there to justify the (predictable) happy ending. I, also, like the road trip elements. Elsewhere on the cast, a young Jessica Biel appears as Allie. She's solid, as is Adam LaVorgna as Eddie. It's also noteworthy to see Gary Cole involved.

However,  the selfish characters, dry humour and observational dialogue about human inanity evoke similarities of TV shows such as Seinfield (1989-98) and Curb Your Enthusiasm (2000). At its core, Mixed Nuts is about a group of outsiders with no home to call their own, who come together for Christmas. In Philip's final message he says ""Christmas is a time when you look at your life through magnifying glass, and whatever you don't have feels overwhelming. Being alone is so much lonelier at Christmas.

The cast of this movie is insane: Steve Martin, Madeline Kahn, Juliette Lewis, Liev Schreiber, Adam Sandler, Rita Wilson, Garry Shandling, Parker Posey, Jon Stewart, Robert Kline, and Rob Reiner. Kahn and Schreiber are great (as always), Martin's character is a delightful disaster, Lewis is over-the-top in a good way, and Sandler does what he does best — singing silly songs and being a bit nonsensical.

78,black_christmas,critics,rotten,n,
79,black_christmas,critics,rotten,n,Glen Morgan's update of Bob Clark's 1974 slasher flick Black Christmas is an exemplar of how to screw up a modern horror film remake.
80,black_christmas,audience,1.5,n,This movie was brutal that's the only complement it's getting though this movie is awful storyline wise the characters are forgettable yeah we got Gretchen Weiners in this mess of a movie hell 2019 movie was better than this & it's not even that good itself
81,black_christmas,audience,5.0,p,Vastly underrated movie. Far far better than the 2019 remake.
82,black_christmas,audience,0.5,n,"This is a totally unnecessary film that has little to do with the original, save a few characters. It's gross and revels in eyeball gore for some reason. If someone you love says they enjoyed this flick, run far away and don't look back."
83,black_christmas,audience,3.0,p,"It’s poorly written, the tone is all over the place and you don’t care about a single character in the movie…but Black Christmas (2006) is still gory, schlocky fun."
84,black_christmas,audience,1.0,n,"I wouldn't even give this a shot if you like the original at all. Not very scary and just ruins the story and mystery of ""Billy"". Keep clear of this trash!"
85,black_christmas,audience,1.5,n,Another remake of a classic movie that fails to inspire!
86,black_christmas,audience,1.5,n,"Having revisited the film after many years, it's now clear to me how this is just a film bad enough to infuriate you. I wouldn't call it the worst horror film I've seen or even the worst remake (because frankly it'll be hard to top the remakes of Pulse and When A Stranger Calls), but it's a fine example of how NOT to make a horror film.

What it does have going for it is great performances from its cast members, well crafted effects, and a genuinely well done backstory to Billy's character (I didn't mind it myself, personally). Everything else?

Let's point out the elephant in the room, and the SERIOUS lack of character development and depth (aside from Billy). One glaring example of this is how the Eve character, whom I literally forgot was even in the movie since she was forgotten about faster than she was introduced, was shown to be some socially awkward girl, and they even make zero effort to hint that she may be one of the killers (yeah, because there's two of them in the movie). Then it turns out she has some unnatural obsession with Billy…why exactly? This also isn't even explored at all because, again, it's dropped as fast as it's mentioned (yeah, the girls here mention she may have an unnatural obsession with Billy), and the best we get is some gigantic mural of Billy's face on her wall. That's it. The girls don't even find it weird or even react to it, and that's where it ends on Eve. Yeah, you do NOT hear from this character again until you see she got axed. That's it.

Expect that and even LESS for the rest of the character outside the serial killers in this movie.

As for the storyline, it's just generic at best, AND the plot has more holes in it than Swiss cheese. If you thought the characters with no depth was confusing enough, it'll only be made worse as you watch the movie and try to get around the story."
87,black_christmas,audience,3.0,p,This movie is 15 years old. It holds up as a decent holiday slasher.
88,black_christmas,audience,0.5,n,"This has to be the worst horror movie remake ever made. It's worse than the Halloween remakes by Rob Zombie, It's worse than the 2010 A Nightmare On Elm Street remake, it's worse than the Child's Play remake, it's worse than any crappy remake time has come up with. You have a bunch of annoying, idiotic frat girls (literally spending Christmas in the same darn house where the killer used to live in), you have this unsettling lady who literally wants to leave Billy a present, and not to mention she throws this guy out of the house despite him living there all because he called the girls b***hes, you have a young, yellow-skinned Billy, and his daughter who looks old enough to be his aunt, oh yeah you also have a hideous, white trash backstory for the killer. Keep in mind, in the original Black Christmas film, the killer was an anonymous assailant who mostly hid in the shadows. The backstory they gave him in this movie is that he was abused and locked in an attic by his mother because he had a liver disease that made his skin yellow or whatever. Oh yeah and if that isn't enough to keep you away from this pile of trash then get this, one night, his mother sneaks up to the attic and rapes him and she ends up getting pregnant with his child. Really? Incest in a movie that's supposed to remake an iconic slasher about a group of girls being stalked by an unknown killer? That is wrong on so many levels! Anyways, let's skip ahead. Our main characters are Kelli, Melissa, Heather, Lauren, Eve, and Kyle. All equally unbearable, trashy, rude, and annoying. Kelli is a whiney, boring final girl whose hot body can't even save her lousy performance. Heather is a boring, uninteresting character with zero characteristics, Melissa is just a beeyotch (b**ch), Kyle is your typical alpha male douchebag who cheats on his girlfriend and makes sex tapes about his affairs, and not to mention he's not even smart enough to keep it a secret from his girlfriend since he literally left his laptop on and open. Lauren is a mean, snobbish, arrogant, trashy, horrible girl who bullies everyone and talks down to them, and literally gets the hell away with it. Eve, well, she didn't even need to exist at all since she just showed up randomly and she is the first of the girls to die. Billy and Agnes could've been a decent killer duo, but this film is so eye-gougingly terrible that the good father and daughter killing spree doesn't matter in the slightest and doesn't hold this film up by any means. Terrible movie. 0.3/10."
89,black_christmas,audience,1.0,n,"From what I understand, this remake had grown in esteem with horror fans, and gained a bit of a cult following. Please, can anyone explain why? I mean, besides base thrills of seeing gory kills (and seriously, these kills... are people made out of jello in this world?), this is a travesty that just pisses on the legacy of the original. Taking a tight, tense mystery, they try to expand and fill in the gaps in the dumbest, most cartoony fashion. It's mean spirited on top of that and all the girls are an indistinguishable attack of the clones."
90,an_american_carol,critics,rotten,n,It fails. Miserably.

97,an_american_carol,critics,rotten,n,"Using sledgehammer gags in the service of a dissent-bashing tale, Zucker aims for the flag-waving brio of Warner Bros. cartoons during World War II, but he succeeds only in ruining Farley's big break."
98,an_american_carol,critics,rotten,n,just too insular to be engaging
99,an_american_carol,critics,rotten,n,What could have been an amusing riff looks more like a propaganda film out to destroy Moore rather than spoof him.
100,an_american_carol,critics,fresh,p,The gags come fast and furiously with one-liners to make the case that liberals don't have exclusive rights to humor in Hollywood.

103,an_american_carol,critics,rotten,n,"Zucker's film reeks of a deeply insecure psychosis, one that's often insultingly mislabeled as patriotism -- which is how it gets away with wrapping itself in red, white and blue while simultaneously ridiculing our Bill Of Rights."

107,an_american_carol,critics,rotten,n,"Overall, Zucker's cinematic middle finger is about as funny as an exploding toilet seat for hemorrhoid-induced senior citizens...a dreary picture mired in sophomoric sludge."
108,an_american_carol,critics,rotten,n,"Utterly asinine, sophomoric, tasteless, the movie has much in common with Zucker's Airplane!, The Naked Gun 2 1/2 and Scary Movie sequels, minus the laughs."
109,an_american_carol,critics,rotten,n,...too unfocused and ill-disciplined to work either as Dickens pastiche or as political satire.
110,an_american_carol,audience,4.0,p,"Exactly what I was hoping for and expecting from this crew. Slapstick comedy with a rightwing lean to it.

If you lean left and can't laugh at yourself now and then, avoid this like the plague. If you lean right, it's a rather entertaining and enjoyable movie."
111,an_american_carol,audience,1.0,n,"Barely watchable since it is so preachy. I think some of the actors got duped by the name Zucker being on this one, or they needed a check, as there is no good reason (even if your politics align) to be in such a sad stab at Michael Moore. 

And I really really dislike Michael Moore, he's got one of the top spots on my list of ""failed filmmakers"", and I was ready for someone to do battle with him, but this was not done well. You have so much material to work with on Moore, and this was the best funny you could do? I was completely let down. In the end Moore was just a vehicle to make some vague projections about how things should run in our country, but no military man would believe Frasier Crane as the ghost of General Patton! Rude!

This one is important if you are looking for something to meme to make a point about your politics in the worst ways, like--if you need a baby's diarrhea to spell such things out for you..."
112,an_american_carol,audience,0.5,n,"Essentially ""Old Man Yells at Cloud - The Movie!""

Politics and humor usually don't mix.  At least make fun of real things instead of made up stereotypes from sensationalist pundits.  Zucker went from being one of the greatest comedy writers of all time to everyone's least favorite uncle at Thanksgiving."
113,an_american_carol,audience,5.0,p,"This is the most truthful Hollywood movie I have ever viewed. No wonder stinky rotten tomatoes ratings are so low. I'm so shocked Hollywood allowed this to be documented. Michael Moore (Malone) will never repent like in this movie. That is the only lie in this movie. If you are a real American (not a fake one) you must watch this movie and get your family to watch it too..,"
114,an_american_carol,audience,1.5,n,"A corroded example of the once-sharp Zucker style of humor, this hackneyed film sounds like it was written by a committee. The filmmakers grab at every opportunity to insert something clever, but just don't seem to have the reach. On the other hand, I could imagine some members of the target audience thinking it was funny simply because of the anti-Moore theme and the warped political viewpoint, even if the script is sophomoric. But for the average moviegoer, it's a real yawner."
115,an_american_carol,audience,4.0,p,Not to bad. I see it has the reeeeeek group mad but what doesn't make them mad?
116,an_american_carol,audience,5.0,p,This was the best damn movie I've ever seen it was very patriotic and anti-liberal.

118,an_american_carol,audience,5.0,p,Great movie!  Refreshing from what we normally get from Hollywood!
119,an_american_carol,audience,4.0,p,"I paid to see this movie when it came out, and loved it.  And I have the DVD.  So I and my friends, and our principles, are the kind that your usual collection of movie reviewers have so much disdain and contempt for, along with this movie.  I am not surprised so many of you found it 'not funny'.  Now you know how we feel, and how we don't find it humorous when hollywierd lefties constantly ridicule us.

I have made people close to me view it against their will and people I haven't even talked to in 3 years view it.  I hate my life.
141,unaccompanied_minors,audience,3.0,p,"A perfectly okay family film that's quite amusing and fun with solid performances from its child actors but ends up being burdened by cringy dialogue, a villain whom I felt wasn't really a bad guy but more of a guy just doing his job who's very overenthusiastic especially after he was pretty bummed he couldn't take a vacation in 15 years - though he does become more friendly near the end - , lame gags and a subplot about the hero's sister that's pretty pointless if you stop to think about it. The idea is that she's afraid of sitting on Santa's lap but after being treated as a living Barbie doll by a girl with braces at a hotel where she's staying, she ultimately overcomes her fear. But she sneaks out when the other girl is sleeping, sleeps in a room with one of the few adults who isn't useless and the other girl is forgotten about. Nothing would've been lost had the scenes been taken out of the movie and her Santa-phobia just not have been there. On another note, the boy from Bad Santa's here! Complete with similar characterisation! And he also has his own subplot that barely amounts to anything. Way to waste a perfectly good character, guys! But hey, at least we can take turns recognising actors that are more well-known nowadays than they were back in 2006, such as Mindy Kaling, Rob Riggle, David Koechner and Tony Hale. Compared to Deck the Halls, Unaccompanied Minors is the more recommendable of the two family-oriented Christmas movies of 2006."

The story for this film is more straightforward than the second in the series, however the writing (or directing) doesn't allow the two comedic leads to really get any laughs. The outtakes before the credits got more laughs out of me. When practical effects are used the special effects are well done, but some of the computer graphics are questionable. There is some enjoyment here if you liked the previous installments of the franchise."

It was just not funny. I know it's a comedy series, but with the character of Jack Frost it could be much more exciting. Also Scott and Carol are doing some things a bit too stupid from what I expected. Carol felt weaker than in part 2. Also I don't understand why Scott isn't able to make time for the family. Just in the movie before, he made the decision to leave his responsibilities to be with his son. It wouldn't be a problem if they said the reason why can't let go of his work. It could be interesting to see why. The acting has lows and highs. And again, Santa Clause 3 is not funny or exciting, I didn't enjoy watching it."

196,a_merry_friggin_christmas,critics,rotten,n,When [Robin] Williams/Mitch quiets down you can see real despair - as though both character and actor were overcompensating in an effort to mask true suffering.
197,a_merry_friggin_christmas,critics,rotten,n,A film that seems to flinch from the harsh truths it was presumably created to address.
198,a_merry_friggin_christmas,critics,fresh,p,Mostly enjoyable if familiar stuff sporting a limber ensemble cast.
199,a_merry_friggin_christmas,critics,fresh,p,The movie exudes a low-key warmth.
200,a_merry_friggin_christmas,audience,5.0,p,Loved that it didn't end in some horrible cliche and the family basically made peace with their disfunction rather than trying to solve everything or act like it was all a big misunderstanding.
201,a_merry_friggin_christmas,audience,4.0,p,It was actually better than I thought it would be
202,a_merry_friggin_christmas,audience,4.0,p,"Much funnier than its reputation suggests. It's very much Bad Santa, with crude sarcastic humour, but if that's your thing you'll enjoy it a lot. Underrated."
203,a_merry_friggin_christmas,audience,5.0,p,It was quite the film.
204,a_merry_friggin_christmas,audience,3.5,p,Despite its flaws A Merry Friggin Christmas pulls through.
205,a_merry_friggin_christmas,audience,5.0,p,Great cast lots of laughs !!!
206,a_merry_friggin_christmas,audience,2.5,n,movie looks bad... but i'll see it because of Robin Williams. Have watched all his movies using boxxy software
207,a_merry_friggin_christmas,audience,1.0,n,"Quit before the half way point. Shame, as I like McHale and love Williams."
208,a_merry_friggin_christmas,audience,2.0,n,"It's like a bunch of atheists got together to make a film of  PureFlix quality. If that was their intention, then they succeeded all too well."
209,a_merry_friggin_christmas,audience,4.5,p,I actually love this movie. Never knew it existed till I saw it it on Hulu. The cast actually works well together and the story line is plausible.
