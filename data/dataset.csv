0,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Gashi's sturdy, no-nonsense portrayal of a sturdy, no-nonsense woman doesn't traffic in cheap inspiration and neither does Basholli's film."
1,hive,critics,fresh,p,"As a statement -- a universal statement -- on how women are so often treated as chattel, or worse, Basholli has constructed something every bit as inspiring as it is powerful."
2,hive,critics,fresh,p,Rarely does a film win over its audience with such effortless execution.
3,hive,critics,fresh,p,Yllka Gashi's portrayal of Hoti is excellently controlled...
4,hive,critics,fresh,p,Anchored by Gashi's quietly determined performance as the heroine-a real person whose company now employs 50 people-Hive is itself restrained but powerful...
5,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Hive is a touching, inspiring drama about the power of sisterhood, filled with fine performances, particularly by star Yllka Gashi, and an insightful glimpse into another culture."
6,hive,critics,fresh,p,"[Writer/director Blerta] Basholli has given us a vivid portrait, not only of one woman's real life struggle to put food on the table but also to transcend gender and cultural bias."
7,hive,critics,fresh,p,"A simple story told without flourish, Hive reminds us that necessity not only can breed invention but also the courage required to keep from going under."
8,hive,critics,fresh,p,It's based on a true story of feminist defiance and healing that counts as one of the more affecting tales of recovery to come from the conflict...
9,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Basholli's film is a spare and unsparing portrait of a survivor who refuses to bend to ancient traditions. As storytelling, this is as good as it gets."
10,hive,critics,fresh,p,It's an observant film that buzzes in anger like bees seem to do in a hive.
11,hive,critics,fresh,p,Though the film is a gorgeously realized dramatization...it can't help but feel detached from the actual war crimes that have still largely gone unaccounted for.
12,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Based on true events, the dramatic film Hive takes place in Kosovo in the 2000s, but it speaks to universal experiences of women who overcome discrimination and misogyny to become business entrepreneurs."
13,hive,critics,fresh,p,The effects of political unrest in postwar Kosovo are felt throughout this bittersweet and quietly perceptive story of healing and humanity in the face of tragedy.
14,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Though it doesn't break new ground, Hive still reminds one how urgently significant it is to honor the unique fighting spirit of women."
15,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Somewhere behind ""Hive,"" I think, you can hear the far-off cry of Euripides' ""The Trojan Women""..."
16,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Hive is ... quietly, unaffectedly inspiring in its simple gestures ... as well as its broader implications..."
17,hive,critics,fresh,p,"""Hive"" seizes and holds your interest simply through the drama created by sympathetic characters trying to surmount awful, unfair hurdles."
18,hive,critics,fresh,p,"Hjve unfolds as a kind of modern folklore. Sentimentality is traded for the undistorted reflection of a culture in a certain time and place, when a woman becomes the life-sized hero who ushers a community towards change."
19,hive,critics,fresh,p,"What Basholli has made is a thoughtful, humanistic exploration of the fortitude needed to summon hope in a time and place resigned to hopelessness."
20,hive,audience,5.0,p,"Based on true story, great movie. Must see!"
21,hive,audience,5.0,p,This is the best movie with the best theme I have ever seen.
22,hive,audience,5.0,p,"Forceful, powerful, and hauntingly honest. The honesty in capturing a woman's plight even when she's fighting for others was second to none."
23,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,Episode 52: Jojo Rabbit / The Lighthouse / Parasite
24,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,A twist-laden narrative that effortlessly shapeshifts from comedy to drama to thriller with liquid ease.
25,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,"My respect for Bong Joon-Ho is up in the sky, because he and everyone else involved in this movie pretty much knocked it out of the park on multiple fronts."
26,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,"A bonkers, beautiful, radical, and drop-dead intelligent dark satirical tale of social inequality [and the] mock egalitarian weirdness of late capitalism."
27,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Like Ki-Jung, Park So-dam is the standout in a film filled with strong performances."
28,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Parasite finds a way to be visually stunning, thematically resonant, horrifyingly tragic and fantastically gripping while fooling the audience into thinking they are having the time of their life."
29,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,"It is such a clash of different genres and moods that it may as well be considered genreless, and yet it all somehow comes together in such a masterful way that you cannot help but leave the theater in a state of awe."
30,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Parasite is a master class in storytelling, providing one of the finest examples of how to entertain the masses while still telling a deep and meaningful story."
31,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,I'll just come out and say it. Parasite is a masterpiece.
32,parasite_2019,critics,rotten,n,The film feels too insincere and hypocritical to take genuinely seriously on its theme of social injustice.
33,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Boon Joon Ho keeps us thoroughly enthralled as the story unfolds, deftly calibrating shifts in tone between satire, screwball farce, black comedy and horror, and also nimbly balancing our sympathies between the two families."
34,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,"A splendid take on class inequalities that force the audience to question who is the parasite, the rich or the poor."
35,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Not content with a basic premise of crime and punishment, director Bong Joon Ho goes a step further, eventually corkscrewing off on a tangent that drags out the running time."
36,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Precisely controlled and drolly ironic in tone even as its events grow more and more berserk, Parasite is always entertaining, foremost."
37,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,Every actor brings different nuances to their respective portrayals and is completely in sync with the picture's seriocomic tone.
38,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,Bong's work was leading to this galvanizing movie which has really shocked people into further questioning the wealth gap and understanding the precariousness of the urban underclass in an era of climate change...
39,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,"One of the best films of the decade and of Korean cinema (a nation that, by the way, has one of the most interesting filmographies of contemporary times). Its greatest strength is telling a story small but so powerful... [Full review in Spanish]"
40,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Bong's film is one which reveals itself in layers and it's almost impossible to categorise - it's at once a black comedy, thriller, horror, family drama and an allegory about class."
41,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,An unusual director with his antenna attuned to social class...Bong has emerged over the past decade as a globally significant filmmaker.
42,parasite_2019,critics,fresh,p,Parasite was the single best film I saw in 2019.
43,parasite_2019,audience,5.0,p,"Summary: Ki-woo's parents are unemployed and trying to make ends meet. After his friend refers him to an affluent family seeking a tutor, Ki-woo tells a white lie about his qualifications and lands the job. Pretty soon, his family members are conveniently landing jobs as well!

Takeaways: A unique thriller that left my heart racing, but for different reasons than most films. Fascinating characters + white lies = eerie fates. P.S. Don't let the Korean language dissuade you. Reading the subtitles doesn't take away the suspense or strangeness of the film."
44,parasite_2019,audience,3.5,p,Strange little movie but enjoyable. Well acted .
45,parasite_2019,audience,5.0,p,"It takes the orignal plot and turns it on it's head, and I loved the way it worked giving a great message and keeping us engaged."
46,parasite_2019,audience,5.0,p,"amazingly metaphorical, top tier cinematography, top tier acting, literally life changing, probably one of the best movies of all time"
47,parasite_2019,audience,5.0,p,The best Korean movie.
48,parasite_2019,audience,5.0,p,"South Korea has an answer for M. Night Shyamalan. That answer is Bong Joon-ho. Bong Joon-ho and his masterpiece Parasite has so much nuance moments in the film especially with the tone shifts. What I loved the most about the tone shift in this film was when the doorbell rang, the main characters get into deeper trouble then they thought with a hint of a twist. The music is beautiful, the writing is brilliant, and the intense scenes during the climax are just miraculous. Parasite is such an extraordinary that will be talked about for years to come."
49,parasite_2019,audience,2.0,n,Didn't really udnerstand the ending or why the father did what he did. Odd movie.
50,parasite_2019,audience,5.0,p,"Too little can be added to talk about this film, so I'll just reaffirm what we've heard millions of times: ""Parasite"" is a masterpiece wih no comparison."
51,parasite_2019,audience,3.5,p,"Warning: SPOILERS
It's possible that I watched this movie with my expectations too high. The way most critics wrote about this movie I was literally expecting something mind blowing. Well… it was…good.
The first hour or so was really barely okay. This involved the poor family infiltrating the rich family by taking over the servants' jobs. Honestly, I normally wouldn't have made it through that first hour, but surely SOMETHING mind blowing was coming right?
Well, not really. The rest of the movie was quite gripping at times. I really felt for the father of the poor family when he murdered the father of the rich family. That was Avery powerful scene.
So add up a barely mediocre first half with a really good, but not great second half, and.., I don't get it? Is there something I'm missing here?"
52,parasite_2019,audience,5.0,p,"Brilliant, amazing premise and execution, incredible immersive direction, cinematography, and editing. One of my favourite movies for this decade."
53,selma,critics,fresh,p,"There's a lump in your throat at the of ""Selma,"" a movie that wisely takes a a snapshot of King's life from the moment he wins the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 through the Selma march in 1965."
54,selma,critics,fresh,p,The controversial story of America's civil rights marches prickles with violence and emotion.
55,selma,critics,fresh,p,"A historical document, but so alive and timely, it is essential viewing almost fifty years after King's assassination."
56,selma,critics,fresh,p,Selma is the best kind of biopic (if you can even call it that).
57,selma,critics,fresh,p,"One of the most effective, well-crafted historical biopics that I've ever seen... giving us a moment in history that feels immediately familiar to the moment we are currently living in."
58,selma,critics,fresh,p,"Wisely uses affective montages, orchestral music, tight pacing, and award-worthy acting to supplement the intense recreations of iconic undertakings."
59,selma,critics,fresh,p,Truly a film that must be seen by today's youth so that we can keep Selma and Ferguson from happening in the future.
60,selma,critics,fresh,p,"Selma is worthy of my highest recommendation. Hopefully like me, you'll clap once the end credits roll."
61,selma,critics,fresh,p,"The acting is exquisite, and DuVernay directs with a sure and confident hand. It's not only the story of Martin Luther King Jr.; it's the story of the American People."
62,selma,critics,fresh,p,"Leaves audiences moved and shaken; this is a movie that will resonate and be remembered for a very, very long time."
63,selma,critics,fresh,p,"In bringing together the personal, the political, and the historic, DuVernay has crafted a film that will be remembered and studied for years to come."
64,selma,critics,fresh,p,"...offering not only a superbly-realized presentation of a particular series of events, but also a sense of what it meant to live through the historical period in question."
65,selma,critics,fresh,p,It's the weight of history that gives Selma so much emotional heft.
66,selma,critics,fresh,p,"...[I]n zooming in on one moment, director DuVernay and writer Paul Webb really force us to live in the trial by fire that was the American South in 1965."
67,selma,critics,fresh,p,"As director, DuVernay employs a style of storytelling... that makes it possible for audiences to find the film engrossing, entertaining, and educational."
68,selma,critics,fresh,p,"Selma is spectacularly staged, impressively acted and narratively satisfying. But it is also something much, much more and we need much, much more like it."
69,selma,critics,fresh,p,"Selma tells a great story about a triumphant moment in civil rights history and the losses it took to get that win, but it doesn't nostalgically let us forget that this moment is just a chapter break in a longer war that still rages on today."
70,selma,critics,fresh,p,There is nothing saccharine about Selma. DuVernay does justice to the illustrious subject matter... and that's no mean feat.
71,selma,critics,fresh,p,A very satisfying picture.
72,selma,critics,fresh,p,"In a time where dedicated activists are speaking their own truths to leaders who are often even less responsive, movies such as Selma feel more essential than ever."
73,selma,audience,3.5,p,"This was a hugely enlightening viewing experience. I wasn't aware of even half of the finer details portrayed about the marches and how there were so many other leaders under MLK that did a lot of the hard work like that. I had imagined he had a huge cult of personality surrounding him and that he just mustered people to his side whenever he wanted to organize and can see now that that was never the case. I do wish he'd been given the Malcolm X treatment though; this moment in history was certainly worthy of its own movie like this, but I find myself wanting to see more of his life elaborated upon. I did prefer The Butler over this movie for a few reasons that mostly boil down to that movie having simpler source material to adapt; this movie was super chaotic by comparison and because its source material didn't go off without a hitch, watching it happen as a movie leads to non-ideal lurches in pace. It didn't help that this one had so many historical figures in it whose names I was just not at all familiar with & who were so numerous that few received much screentime, causing some confusion in me as I sat through this one."
74,selma,audience,5.0,p,"This is a reminder of the dangers black people faced, and continue to face, simply attempting to access the rights that are promised to them by our corrupt governmen(s)."
75,selma,audience,5.0,p,Historical and moving. this film was played in my high school History class and it was some of the best class days this year. I found myself immersed in the film and I cared a lot about what happened. The film itself was well paced and fairly easy to follow although it was paused several times during the class for explanations. The struggles depicted in this movie are brutal and shocking which largely make up the films conflict. Including the brutality of the police and racism of the town of Selma the film also includes President Johnson who's performance was one of the best as he truly seems like the actual President Johnson. His character is one of the most complicated as he wants to help the protagonist MLK give African Americans the right to vote but he also has other priorities. When MLK won't take no for an answer Johnson makes some dirty moves on Martin in order to stop him from marching on the capitol. He seems to have good intentions but isn't making his citizens right to vote his priority and he also uses harsh language later in the film when speaking with the intolerant governor of Selma. The lead and protagonist Martin Luthor King is a charismatic and driven character. He makes for an incredibly compelling character as he isn't portrayed as perfect by any means but the film intelligently is able to display his flaws and mistakes while still treating him like the hero he is to the civil rights movement. The supporting cast while not playing huge roles in the film or having much character arcs still contribute to the film and every character they follow has their moment good or bad. The end is a little choppy with the use of text to explain what happens after the events of the film but showing what actually happens after the film with the exception of MLK would not have made for a compelling movie and honestly aren't stories worth telling so why they chose to use text is understandable. Overall the film takes an incredible story of a political strategist and minister who through planning and sacrifice was able to lead the African American community to gaining the right to vote. The film is filled with powerful triumph and sadness as obstacles and loss is dealt with but perseverance jumped over the hurdles were able to bring change to a time that treated some Americans as less of a person.
76,selma,audience,5.0,p,There's only one word that can describe this film: Beautiful. Extremely well made.
77,selma,audience,4.5,p,"Ciò che più colpisce di Selma è l'estrema eleganza con cui viene narrata l'intera vicenda; si racconta di pagine nere della storia americana e di personaggi infimi; lo si fa senza far mancare nulla eppure senza essere troppo espliciti o violenti più del dovuto.
Il ritratto di Luther King jr è completo, introspettivo e molto personale; colpisce come si riesca a rendere perfetta la presenza del personaggio; come se lo si conoscesse per davvero.
Il tutto completato da una canzone meravigliosa e meritatamente premiata con un Oscar.
Qualche immagine di repertorio in più su ciò che realmente accadde, sarebbe stata gradita."
78,selma,audience,5.0,p,"The greatest movie about MLK, Jr.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
79,selma,audience,5.0,p,Very touching movie that the whole world has to see!
80,selma,audience,4.0,p,"I saw this movie when it came out, I was much younger then I am now, and it had a powerful effect on me. Rewatching it now it leaves much to be desired but in the time frame it was released it was powerful."
81,selma,audience,4.0,p,"Except for the portrayal of Lyndon B Johnson, this was an exceptional film! David Oyelowo is incredible as Martin Luther King jr that its shocking to believe he wasn’t nominated for an oscar."
82,selma,audience,0.5,n,Very boring. Didn't reach the end.
83,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Despite the unexplained language barriers or farfetched plot, this delightfully delicious foray into the unimaginable never becomes preachy or immature."
84,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"This is a film about a rat who becomes a chef in Paris. But it's so much more than that. It's about what a great artist can be, where a great artist can come from, it's about food and how to savour it."
85,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"A love letter to Paris, a valentine to the fine art of cooking, and a gift to film fans of all ages."
86,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,A delectable treat that represents the finest qualities in animation and American cinema.
87,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,Has great vocal performances throughout and is about a character figuring out where they belong and finally being accepted there. I love it!
88,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"That is the (...) imperative message of Ratatouille. Everyone is not an artist, but anyone could be an artist. Because, as living creatures, it is simply what we do."
89,ratatouille,critics,rotten,n,"The studio's latest effort offers beautiful and strikingly realistic animation, but the flawed concept should have been scrapped..."
90,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"I won't spoil the broth, but suffice to say Ratatouille is a bursting with bright flavors, some spice, and deep warmth that settles in your belly and satisfies body and soul."
91,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"There is so much to enjoy and celebrate here, Ratatouille deserves more than a review: it could (and probably will) inspire books about creativity and good taste."
92,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Ratatouille was written and directed by Brad Bird, the guy behind The Incredibles, and while his new movie isn't as brainy as that one, it has lots of lovely touches to appeal to parents as well as kids."
93,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Ratatouille is a triumph that not only pays tribute to the spirit of discovery, but revels in the fun of making a few of its own."
94,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"And there's Remy himself, voiced by irreverent comic Patton Oswalt. Yes, he's a rat, and a pantless one at that, but he's a charming rat."
95,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,The latest from Pixar and Oscar winning writer-director Brad Bird is a fabulously enjoyable parable about the pursuit of excellence and rising above the preconceptions of others.
96,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"It's not just the best animated film this year, it's the best animated film to come out of the U.S. since Bird's last effort, The Incredibles."
97,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Like the snooty restaurant critic Anton Ego (voiced by Peter O'Toole), we enter Ratatouille thinking we've tasted it all, and we leave hoping for seconds."
98,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,It's a great programme for all the family.
99,ratatouille,critics,rotten,n,It's not my favourite Pixar film.
100,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"No restaurant has ever benefited from placing rats in a recipe, but the digital wizards in Pixar's kitchen have cooked up a winning peasant dish in Ratatouille."
101,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"Ratatouille is a wonderful, wistful comedy, and a sparkling return to form for the computer animation studio Pixar after last year's lacklustre Cars."
102,ratatouille,critics,fresh,p,"As in his previous films, Bird offers up a story with substance."
103,ratatouille,audience,4.5,p,88/90 goooooood very good
104,ratatouille,audience,5.0,p,I love this movie so much I raced a boat my family was on in france so I wouldn't be split up with them but also so I could take a picture of the restaurant this movie was based on
105,ratatouille,audience,5.0,p,This film is the definition of a masterpiece
106,ratatouille,audience,5.0,p,"My favorite movie of all time, very compelling and very calming basically memorized every scene."
107,ratatouille,audience,4.5,p,i love how this movie tells that food can hug people when they need
108,ratatouille,audience,5.0,p,"One of Pixar's best movies! Remy, a rat, is an aspiring chef and finds a way to realize his dream in Paris. As with every film, Pixar ups the game in animation. The water, fire effects are great as is the movement of the rat characters. The human characters are stylized, but believable in a cartoonish way. Brad Bird does an amazing job as director/writer and crafts an excellent story. Patton Oswalt is great as Remy and Peter O'Toole is a perfect cast as Anton Ego. The writing is also well done, Ego's review near the end of the movie is a highlight. An amazing film, go see it!"
109,ratatouille,audience,4.0,p,Very well made and felt very artistic and didn't care to be made for a child audience and go all kidish. It even went into a partial emotional route which was a well surprise. Rating A-
110,ratatouille,audience,3.0,p,Kinda weird they let the rats run the kitchen but you do you I guess...
111,ratatouille,audience,4.0,p,"One of the best Pixar movies ever made, Brad Bird is an amazing director, the movie can be enjoyable for all ages."
112,ratatouille,audience,5.0,p,This movie is absolutely brilliant on every conceivable level. Brad Bird proves again that he is one of the top animated movie directors. The story of the unlikely hero is incredible and written with great purpose. The visuals in this movie are breathtaking. Remy's first sight of Paris is one of the most beautiful animated movie shots ever and the ending monologue from Anton Ego and the way it is presented is the cherry on top of this breathtaking and incredible film.
113,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,"Some movies just have the perfect script, packed full of endlessly quotable lines that are effortlessly delivered by an extraordinary cast. A phenomenal movie, that everyone needs to have seen."
114,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,"Dooley Wilson gets his best screen role to date as Rick's piano player, and comes through with ease."
115,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,"Casablanca walks a thin line between classic romance and cheesy, but it stays true to its course. It could have very easily steered right into cheesy and stayed there, but because Curtiz had a vision it doesn't go there."
116,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,"This is an occasion where the final whole seriously and decisively outweighs the sum of its flawed, imperfect parts. Screenwriter Koch lived up to his pledge to ""develop a serious melodrama of present-day significance."""
117,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,The classic pairing of Bogie and Bergman...
118,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,"It is excitingly acted, smartly directed, and tells a story crammed with suspense, characterization and action. The cast of players is enough to fill the theatre alone, for it includes some of the finest players Hollywood has to boast about."
119,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,"Warners have been generous in fitting fine players to roles that become gems, each in its own way, through 1 the incisive handling of Claude Rains, Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Dooley Wilson, S. Z. Sakall and Joy Page."
120,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,"It's a war picture that is not about the war so much as it is about people, just people who find themselves pocketed by one or another set of war circumstances."
121,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,"Claude Rains, as a French captain whose sympathies do not jibe with his uniform of allegiance to Nazi rule, gives a grand performance."
122,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,"Casablanca won't let you down, not too much anyway. It's a good melodrama, slightly overrated perhaps, but still good to the last drop. Especially the last drop."
123,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,"This film, incidentally, provides Bogart with his first great romantic role. And he is ace-high in it."
124,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,"It may not be the best of its kind ever, but it is good melodrama."
125,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,It wouldn't surprise us if the director's skill in this particular instance compels his nomination for an Academy prize.
126,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,"Director Michael Curtiz, whose sureness and skill ere rarely to be questioned in any picture he handles, have given Casablanca an exotic atmosphere, a flow of action, surprises and punch to make it constantly interesting."
127,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,Casablanca is brisk well made for those who like romance and adventure handled by a good actor like Mr Bogart.
128,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,"Apparently Casablanca, which I must say I liked, is working up a rather serious reputation as a fine melodrama. Why? It is obviously an improvement on one of the world's worst plays; but it is not such an improvement that that is not obvious."
129,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,"The tale as unfolded is one of love, hate, revenge and gallantry and will please those who watch its visualization because of its fine reserve during most of its telling."
130,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,"The whole thing is exciting, first-class entertainment."
131,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,"In the hands of this cast and the capable direction of Curtiz. the film remains absorbing throughout, where lesser players might have made it seems slow-moving. The picture lacks action, but never drama."
132,1003707-casablanca,critics,fresh,p,"Casablanca in the days before the allied occupation had obvious possibilities as the background of a film of intrigue and adventure, and the film... has taken at least a reasonable percentage of its opportunities."
133,1003707-casablanca,audience,5.0,p,"This movie has everything. Everyone should see it. Love, betrayal, sacrifice, putting something before yourself."
134,1003707-casablanca,audience,5.0,p,"This is likely the most famous movie of all time and for good reason.  Certainly the most quoted, and frequently cited as an all time favorite, Casablanca won Best Picture, Director, and Writer awards at the Oscars.  the definitive rebuttal to notions of the author in film, the romantic drama put together in pieces by many different sources, with script pages completed just moments before the cameras rolled.  The performances by Bogart and Bergman are so subtle and complex because the actors themselves had no idea how it was going to end.  

Almost every frame of the movie is an icon, and it has been endlessly copied and parodied."
135,1003707-casablanca,audience,5.0,p,"Absolutely the best screenplay ever written. So many snappy, quotable lines, by performers at the top of their game. This includes Conrad Veidt, the great German silent film actor, the leering Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Calude Rains, Dooley Wilson, Paul Henreid, and the incomparable Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart. The one movie I watch every time it is on, and still pick up on subtleties."
136,1003707-casablanca,audience,5.0,p,I love old Movies and at the height of the war this one shows what people were desperate to do to escape. The love and compassion was amazing in this Movie. Humphrey Bogart is at his best in this film.
137,1003707-casablanca,audience,5.0,p,"Arguably the best romantic movie ever made, the four lead characters are very well rounded and enjoyable to watch. I highly recommend this movie to anyone with a love of historical or romantic stories."
138,1003707-casablanca,audience,3.0,p,"This is one of those movies you watch because you feel like you have to not because you enjoy it, it is technically well made but I'm not planning to ever see it again"
139,1003707-casablanca,audience,5.0,p,I love this film even though my shoes were dirty
140,1003707-casablanca,audience,5.0,p,I rate this as the Greatest movie all time
141,1003707-casablanca,audience,5.0,p,This is one of the 10 best movies ever made.
142,1003707-casablanca,audience,5.0,p,"As time goes by, you appreciate Casablanca more and more.
As time goes by, those iconic quotes may be remembered more and more in your brain.
As time goes by, you may notice the film is filled with extreme cynical and genuine humor, being hilarious at times.
As time goes by, you may realize the love plot line is only 25% of the film and there's more messages given beyond that.
As time goes by, you may find yourself revisiting this classic.
As time goes by, you may shed a tear during these multiple viewings.
As time goes by, Casablanca is a masterpiece who does deserve the title ""masterpiece"" it's already given."
143,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"It's a good one. If you like Little Woman, the you'll love this interpretation."
144,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Even though it's been 25 years since Winona Ryder, Susan Sarandon, and Christian Bale delighted us in the last version of Little Women, this new version? Definitely worth seeing."
145,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"All the frilly dresses of Little Women's numerous film versions prevented me from accepted Louisa May Alcott's classic story as a pro-feminist creation, even when Katharine Hepburn played the lead. Writer-director Greta Gerwig changed that."
146,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Too many stitches in the narrative quilt, its often rushed sentiment suffocating the genuine moments of resonant emotion. But it does have a thing or two to say about love."
147,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,Gerwig's narrative proposal is modern and dynamic and gives her a fertile ground to reflect on the creative act and femininity with a subtlety that greatly enhances his discourse. The cast is superb in every way [Full review in Spanish]
148,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Why make another ""Little Women"" adaptation? Because we all needed Greta Gerwig's magical touch on this delightful tale. Gerwig taps into the same honest vulnerability she succeed in through her Oscar nominated film, ""Lady Bird""."
149,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"One of the best films of the year, it's a tonic for recent depressing events."
150,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,Gerwig's sumptuous film shows a modern audience that feminism and romance can fit together nicely...
151,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"To her credit, and to one's pleasant surprise, Gerwig does not attempt to inject contemporary identity politics into her film, at least not overly so."
152,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"With the high level of acting and a filmmaker proving her chops once again, these Little Women are well worth your time."
153,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"It has all the coziness and warmth one expects from this sort of nostalgic period drama, while also capturing the revolutionary spirit of Alcott's novel."
154,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"A rarity, an adaptation of an often told tale that manages a rethink while still holding true to what made the source material so beloved."
155,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,Rarely does an adaptation so steeped in the national consciousness and embedded in popular culture hit the right notes in the right order for the right audience at the right time.
156,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"These are good people doing their best, loving each other even through their mistakes, and that love emanates from the movie."
157,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Gerwig draws out the progressive strands in Alcott's original, emphasising its latent feminism."
158,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"A superb, well acted adaptation that solidifies Greta Gerwig as one of our greatest filmmakers, that Saoirse Ronan is one of our great actresses, and that Florence Pugh has a terrific career ahead of her."
159,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"[Greta Gerwig] brought a filmmaker's perspective to the story of the March sisters, as she put a meta spin on the proceedings that deviated from the source material ... but seemingly honoured who Louisa May Alcott ... was as a person"
160,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,"There isn't a single false note in this tale, and that starts with the acting and goes all the way down to the production design, score, and costumes."
161,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,[Greta Gerwig] indeed offers a fresh spin by infusing her humanistic directorial voice while remaining loyal to the timeless story.
162,little_women_2019,critics,fresh,p,Little Women proves that Gerwig's directorial debut Lady Bird was no fluke - firmly confirming that she is a great filmmaker; a force to be reckoned with. It shines a new light on a classic story that retains the themes and drama that made it so.
163,little_women_2019,audience,5.0,p,I love the aesthetic and the acting in this movie
164,little_women_2019,audience,4.5,p,"Absolutely touching and amazing film, I have no words."
165,little_women_2019,audience,3.0,p,Not a bad adaptation with good characterisation in the actors of the March sisters.  However a choppy and confusing stop start storyline and a poor choice in actor for Laurie let's itself down badly. I tend to find it important that when characters are aged up it's important to do all the characters properly. After the time skip compared to the girls Laurie looks to young and it just makes Amy look like a cradle robber.
166,little_women_2019,audience,4.5,p,"This is one of the best movies I've watched... ever. I had to take half a star, though, because there was something plot-wise that I wish were... different."
167,little_women_2019,audience,3.5,p,"I liked everything about this movie except as follows: Emma Watson's acting wasn't very good (I know, I was surprised too)...and the time jumps were confusing to everyone that wasn't already familiar with the story."
168,little_women_2019,audience,5.0,p,esta pelicula es increible con actuaciones solidas
169,little_women_2019,audience,5.0,p,A wondrous gem of a film.
170,little_women_2019,audience,4.0,p,"Entertaining.  Well done.  Seeing Saoirse Ronan & Emma Watson brought into sharp focus the difference in acting ""chops"" of these young women.  Emma should have hung it up after Harry Potter.  Saoirse is an enormous talent.  I think the story is a bit saccharin, but I think Greta Gerwig did a good job getting beyond that and making it interesting."
171,little_women_2019,audience,5.0,p,This movie so gorgeous and story so many emotion. my fellings when i watching it was unpredictable.You must see..
172,little_women_2019,audience,2.0,n,"I have several issues with this movie. If it's the first time experiencing this story, the out of order narrative would be confusing. The costumes and hair are too far off from being correct. I don't require exact historical accuracy, but they just took it too far with this one, especially Joe. I also don't understand why American actors could not be found to play the sisters, although Florence Pugh was lovely. I much prefer the 1994 version with Winona Ryder."
173,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"It's the greatest comedy - and funniest movie - of all time. ... But, as with most of Chaplin's other films, it'll also make you cry your eyes out."
174,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Several high spots stand out as notable examples of Chaplin's expert timing of slapstick burlesque, scenes that are apt to make the spectator shed tears from the strain of laughter."
175,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"The sequence in which the modern mechanical feeder for workers is introduced is a gem of comedy invention. It is one of the funniest episodes, and certainly the most ingenious."
176,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,There are reminders of every Chaplin picture that was ever made all through Modern Times and there are enough brand new comic inventions to explain why Charlie takes such a long time between pictures and why they are so superlatively worth waiting for.
177,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"What most amazes you about Modern Times, is the fact that, in this day of superfine sound films, it says everything without saying anything."
178,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"In many ways Modern Times is old-fashioned film comedy, but it is the kind of comedy which has made millions of people laugh all over the world and which has won Mr. Chaplin the great affection and love."
179,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"While he has borrowed a few symbolic touches from the Russian picture makers, there is nothing of real significance in Chaplin s work except his earnest desire, and his really great ability, to entertain."
180,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Modern Times, underneath its farce, is a curiously passionate jibe at the herd-instincts and herd clangour of a machine age."
181,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"The monotony of this Job ""gets"" Charlie and he runs wild, attacking everything and everybody in view with his brandished wrenches in one of the funniest scenes ever filmed."
182,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Miss Goddard put us in mind more of a ballet dancer in portraying her role than a screen player, which fits in, on the whole, rather well with Chaplin's style. She's attractive and has charm."
183,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"It is episodically hilarious but never consistently so, and you come away from the Penn remembering, not so much the heroic Chaplinesque figure as a nut-and-bolt factory, a red flag, a feeding machine and a song."
184,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"It doesn't seem possible to inject a large quantity of heart appeal in a heavily gagged-up comedy but Chaplin does it. That's Chaplin's forte, and that's what distinguishes his comedies from all others."
185,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,Chaplin exhibits his amazing versatility in the fast-forgotten art of pantomime and makes you laugh when you had perhaps expected to cry.
186,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Remaining silent, Charlie is more eloquent in pantomime than many other comedians are with the added use of spoken words. Poking gentle fun at mechanized industry, Charlie is comic indeed."
187,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Five years absence from the screen has not diminished Chaplin's art. In his usual fashion, he can provoke laughs or tears, and keep the audience absorbed in whatever he is doing."
188,modern_times,critics,rotten,n,"What begins as a rather heavy lampooning gets lost in a series of first-rate slapstick acts and ends up as an idyll. Modern Tunes is, of course, funny picture; it Is also a very disappointing one."
189,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"Chaplin [has] returned to basic fundamentals in story construction, coupling with it an ironic poke or two at the System, as constituted today, and combined with that his great talent in his first screen appearance since City Lights."
190,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,There are many sequences which will become famous. The philosophy is evident. It is clear that Chaplin's answer to modern times is that if the individual does not conform he is taken away in a van to prison or to hospital.
191,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,"The full revelation of [Paulette Goddard] is not to be detected in this production, but there is unusual promise in her work -- perhaps more than in the instance of any other Chaplin leading woman."
192,modern_times,critics,fresh,p,".Many of the situations are slapstick and many of a higher order, some quite amusing and a few hilarious."
193,modern_times,audience,1.0,n,20% rating. Didn't laugh as much as I wished.
194,modern_times,audience,5.0,p,esta película es totalmente divertida que te va a dejar escapar una risa
195,modern_times,audience,2.5,n,"I mean its typical Chaplin. I find his humor mostly predictable and the original annoying steve urkel. He is not really my cup of tea. In this day and age, I prefer more intellect with my humor, although this keeps you somewhat entertained. I liked seeing how the old department stores were organized and how police used to wander the streets. I also liked seeing the inappropriate coke scene and when they talk about ""darkies"" this people back in the day had no chill. Cant believe this is what people looked forward to for entertainment, the bar was not very high. This wasn't his best film I'm afraid and I don't like slapstick to begin with."
196,modern_times,audience,5.0,p,Chaplin Brings his slapstick comedy Genius to his Timeless as his beloved Character The Tramp and goes from Working in a factory to jail then to a waiter and the along the way the results are every time hilarious results in this Slient pre code masterpiece from one of the masters filmmakers of all time
197,modern_times,audience,4.0,p,"Class on precarious jobs and how to face it, more valid today than 85 years ago."
198,modern_times,audience,2.5,n,"I think it's safe to say that I'm just not a big fan of Charlie Chaplin. As of writing this review, I've seen The Great Dictator, City Lights and, earlier today, Modern Times. The latter is a noted criticism of industrialisation and its effect on humanity, but most of the film is, unsurprisingly, The Tramp spending long stretches of time falling over, bumping into things and being so gosh darned loveable that you just wanna pick him up and take him home. It felt like the least funny and least substantial of the 3 films, with a scattershot plot and sporadic social commentary. This might have been intentional, as this was to be The Tramp's final cinematic outing, and Chaplin wanted him to go out doing what he had become famous for. It does end on an organically positive note, and if Chaplin's style of comedy appeals to you, then Modern Times should be on your watchlist. But I wasn't won over by its message or its content."
199,modern_times,audience,5.0,p,I love Modern Times so much I came back for the second showing! See my earlier post.
200,modern_times,audience,5.0,p,"Charlie is mesmerizing. Modern Times is one of my favorite films. Its funny and poignant, a timeless classic as relevant today as it always was. This was the Little Tramps last appearance and Charlies last silent film. There is some dialogue as well as sound effects and a brilliant score but Charlie himself doesnt speak. We do hear his voice, however, at the end!"
201,modern_times,audience,5.0,p,Charlie Chapman's talents mesmerize.
202,modern_times,audience,4.5,p,"Modern Times is unexpectedly hilarous. Somehow the 30s humor still works. The story is related in a very good way, and the mix between sound and silence is just incredible.
Modern Times is one of the most important films in history, uniting silent and sound movies, but more important, it is a really good film."
203,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,A masterpiece within or outside the superhero & comic book genre it explores. Heath Ledger delivers one of the most iconic performances in film history. [Full review in Spanish]
204,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,A rare beast. It's a summer blockbuster with equal parts brain and brawn.
205,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,The famous masked vigilante has never looked or felt more intense.
206,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"With his smeared whiteface make-up and leering razor-slashed smile, Ledger's Joker is creepy enough to look at, but what he represents is even more chilling."
207,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,The awards hype is warranted.
208,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"The Dark Knight managed to capture something complex and instinctive about the ""war on terror"" era."
209,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"A masterpiece. Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight is not only one of the greatest comic book movies you'll ever see, but also one of the best films of all-time."
210,the_dark_knight,critics,rotten,n,It seems almost cruel to take beloved child archetypes and turn them into projections for adult angst.
211,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"Heath Ledger gives one of the best performances of the last twenty years. When you watch his take on the Joker, it's one of complete surprise and mystery. It's frightening with how chaotic and mischievous he makes him."
212,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"Ledger's performance alone is good enough to make The Dark Knight a very good movie, but fortunately this is a film with even more than that -- making it the not just the best film of the summer, but one of the best films of the year."
213,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,The Dark Knight represents a masterpiece in filmmaking as Christopher Nolan takes the Batman Begins sequel to an entirely new level.
214,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,The definitive movie of its genre and the best Batman film to date
215,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,Heath Ledger is great.
216,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"The movie's a real neo-noir all right, wallowing in darkness, thrilled with how bad we are, and getting such a kick out of our impending doom it cheers you right up."
217,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"Not just a perfect comic book movie, not just a perfect Batman movie, but darn-near a perfect movie, full stop."
218,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"A film is only as good as its villain. By that standard, The Dark Knight achieves true greatness."
219,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"The Dark Knight always ought to be played on the biggest screen possible, and played loud, like a Led Zepplin song. Director Christopher Nolans' skyscapes, the helicopter shots and views from the 200th floor, are IMAX at its best."
220,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"It might not be the most fun superhero movie ever made, but it's certainly the most mature, complex and intriguing of them all. [Full review in Spanish]"
221,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,"The Dark Knight may not supply a happy ending, but there is a feeling of exhilaration as Batman rides off from the pursuing cops, and the realization that this is another big step forward for comic book movies."
222,the_dark_knight,critics,fresh,p,The action sequences are like being injected with a shot of adrenalin straight into the heart.
223,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,p,A cinematic masterpiece about the war against terror and definitely the most accurate Batman movie vibe ever made
224,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,p,"My favorite of the trilogy, the plot is very good, heath ledger portrayed a unsettling, psychotic villain, which is the best joker performance yet. The interrogation scene is just amazing. This is one of the best batman films, Christopher Nolan did a very good job on this film"
225,the_dark_knight,audience,4.5,p,This is the best movie in the trilogy. Ledger brings this home offering the best characterization of the Joker. Sometimes Ledger makes the Joker legit scary. Something I haven't experienced before.
226,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,p,"It's a perfect movie. Everything is well done, the acting is all very good, the special effects adequate, a great direction from Nolan, all the character arcs well done and a joker who always steals the show. Side by Side with Spider-Man 2 in terms of best super hero film (my opinion). (10/10)"
227,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,p,"While ""Batman Begins"" laid the cinematic groundwork for a gritty narrative on the Caped Crusader, this movie miraculously exceeds its predecessor by highlighting the moral dilemma of vigilantism, accompanied with many twists and turns. The titular protagonist exhibits enough screen time of brains and brawn, but it is Ledger's portrayal of the Joker that steals the show as he constantly pushes the hero to his limits, raising the stakes in a battle between order versus chaos. Even though the fight choreography is arguably mediocre, I appreciate the more realistic direction as intended. ""The Dark Knight"" remains the gold standard for the superhero genre."
228,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,p,One of the best Comic book movies Ever
229,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,p,This might just be my favorite superhero movie. It’s a masterpiece
230,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,p,Easily the best comic book adaptation of my generation. Outstanding!!!
231,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,p,"Literally the best super hero movie ever made, it ticks all the boxes. I will watch it time and time again"
232,the_dark_knight,audience,5.0,p,Till now is the greatest superhero movie
233,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"For me, it didn't fulfill the promise of Infinity War, but it did fulfill the promise of the previous twenty movies."
234,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"I'm just grateful to have the privilege to watch this along with the rest of the world. It's not perfect, but it has been one hell of a ride."
235,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"Here's the other really neat thing about Endgame: it made me think of priorities in life and what or who is worth sacrificing for, especially loved ones..."
236,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,The true superteam event releases marked something slightly different and spectacular...End Game over the original Guardians by a hair...
237,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,This goes beyond the usual scale.
238,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,A film that somehow manages to be as epic as fans hope and as dramatic as the MCU deserves.
239,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"Films don't come any huger than this: the closing chapter to an 11-year saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, told across some 22 movies. And by the end of its three-hour runtime, there will definitely be tears."
240,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,There really is very little that could be improved about Endgame. There's certainly no more that could be thrown at it.
241,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"So much of the art form is about storytelling, and bringing so many side stories and characters to a satisfying conclusion is tough, and the film blended a (rather) unpredictable plot with emotional character beats deftly..."
242,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"Avengers: Endgame is everything Marvel fans could want and more. It will be interesting to see how the MCU moves into the future after the events in the film, but woe be upon anyone who doubts their ability to adapt and succeed mightily."
243,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,I found Avengers: Endgame wonderfully satisfying.
244,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,There are [Marvel] movies that have been just as entertaining and a lot smarter than this one.
245,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"Feels like the end of the old cycle, the beginning of a reset. Old favourites gone, passing the mantle to others before they go. We even see a poster that reads, ""Where do we go, now that they're all gone?"""
246,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"The MCU is the ultimate long game, and Endgame feels like its glorious final lap."
247,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"Terms like masterpiece and game-changer are often thrown around a bit hastily, but not on this occasion."
248,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"The fight scenes, while chaotic and intermittently exhilarating, are unable to avoid repetition; such is the nature of invincible entities dueling other invincible entities."
249,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"""Avengers: Endgame"" was a wonderful surprise, filling almost every minute (all 181 of them) with excitement, drama, humor, and visually interesting and entertaining intrigue."
250,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,What The Russo Brothers did here is take high expectations and blow them out of the water with an emotionally thrilling finale. Get ready to be moved!
251,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,The only thing that I know for sure has ended with the Marvel Cinematic Universe is my patience.
252,avengers_endgame,critics,fresh,p,"Endgame is nothing short of a deserved send-off to the Infinity Saga, stamping an impressive mark on the cultural psyche. It has been one hell of a ride."
253,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,p,"Avengers Endgame is the perfect conclusion to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If it were the final movie in the entire series I would be very content with it, but it does setup a different world we will come to see in the future. As a fan of the comics the movies are based on, and a huge fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole this movie was made with people like me in mind and I loved it. It brought emotion, laughs, and plenty of references and moments I have been wanting to see. For people who haven't seen a Marvel movie before this one, don't start here. This is not a movie for the average moviegoer to see without any background information and it will be incredibly boring, and you will be lost the entire time. For everyone else though, see this movie, enjoy it, and possibly even see it again. This is by far one of my favorite films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and has plenty of scenes I will be watching again and again when it releases on Blu-ray."
254,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,p,Amazing film considering the build up for the story for over a decade. Amazing.
255,avengers_endgame,audience,4.5,p,4/5 on the extraordinary scale. On the normal scale it is a 15/10.
256,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,p,Perfect movie and perfect ending tribute to captain America and iron man
257,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,p,"A Masterpiece! I absolutely loved everything about that movie, and have watched it over and over again and still absolutely loved it! Amazingly done!"
258,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,p,"Fantastic culmination of MCU storylines! Acting is outstanding and although the movie is long, no scene is wasted. An absolute treat for Marvel fans."
259,avengers_endgame,audience,3.0,p,"Nothing much to see here, just a return to the usual Marvel-movie quality level. It's good to see the non-superhero Iron Man finally removed from the picture, with his only power in being a rich guy and owner of advanced technology (and completely unconvincingly portrayed as being smart enough to build or fix said technology himself; kind of the equivalent of that other grossly overrated rich tech guy character we have IRL in a certain Elon Musk), though sadly they did have to turn him into The Great Martyr to get him over with.

Really the only impressive Avengers movie in a long time was Infinity War, because it actually did something different and interesting, i.e. killing a lot of superheroes, and introduced a really good, complex villain. Beyond that, all they can do is return to their teen-boy oriented Marvel-as-usual movies."
260,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,p,AMAZING I LOVED THE PART WHEN SHARK BOY 360° NO SCOPED MARIO JUDA WHILE LEBRON JAMES DUNKED ON THANOS
261,avengers_endgame,audience,5.0,p,PERFECT. I mean everything about this movie is beyond perfection.
262,avengers_endgame,audience,4.5,p,"Intense, enthralling, and emotionally fulfilling in all the right ways, Avengers: Endgame is a cultural phenomenon that deserves all of its acclaim, past, present, and future."
263,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"I can't think of an American-made film that stands up to multiple viewings quite like 'Kane'...it never feels like Welles and company are showing off, just showing what a movie can do."
264,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,Welles is the most exciting thing that's happened since sound.
265,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"I particularly like the structure of the film, especially the use of the news reel footage and the newspaper headlines to move the plot forward."
266,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,We aren't going to quibble about the genius business. Time will take care of that and if Welles goes down in history as one well be happy to have been among those who enjoyed the results of his great talent.
267,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,The sheer brilliance and audacity of Citizen Kane... make the film the most astounding cinematic achievement of the season. It ranks with Disney's Fantasia as a milestone in motion picture technique.
268,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"Citizen Kane Is a triumph not only for Orson Welles, but for his entire company as well."
269,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"Everything that Welles has to say in his capacity of author, actor and director is individual and striking. The grouping of the characters, the odd camera angles, the revealing little character glimpses are all superb."
270,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"Whether the story of Charles Foster Kane is a biography of one man or a composite of many, as Orson Welles claims, matters not so much as the fact that here we have a completely new approach to film biography."
271,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"[It] is my opinion that Mr. Welles has been sympathetic and kind. He reveals great respect for people, and a knowledge of their powers and talents."
272,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"It is daring, different, thrilling and revolutionary, a power play of startling brilliance."
273,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"This first screen effort of Orson Welles is of such vast difference to other pictures, in subject material, in treatment, in technique, in cast and in performance that the best advice perhaps is, ""See what you think."""
274,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,Welles has grasped the art of the photoplay in a single venture. He has accomplished in one picture what Hollywood veterans have been aiming at tor years.
275,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"I would say it is a great picture but... It is one of those things, like the Pyramids, which are impressive and definitely interesting to have seen, but one can have more fun than looking at the Pyramids."
276,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"In [Citizen Kane] Welles is revealed as having absorbed a tremendous amount of the tricks and tradition of the theater, and still more, that he possesses the skill and craftsmanship to adapt such knowledge to motion pictures in a masterful way."
277,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"[Orson Welles] has done a remarkable job of producing something different from the ordinary run of film fare, and in doing so has brought a number of new faces to the screen, besides appearing in the title roll himself."
278,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"Mr. Welles evolves by slow, precise degrees from the' ebullient, idealistic young man out to remold the world by the power of his inherited wealth, to a grim, petty tyrant without illusions, clinging tenaciously to a life which holds little for him."
279,citizen_kane,critics,rotten,n,"It's interesting. It's different. In fact, it's bizarre enough to become a museum piece. But its sacrifice of simplicity to eccentricity robs it of distinction and general entertainment."
280,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"To my way of thinking, Gregg Toland, the photographer, has accomplished the best job ever turned out by a camera."
281,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,I saw Citizen Kane months ago and it sticks in my mind almost as vividly as if I had seen it yesterday. And I shall certainly see it again.
282,citizen_kane,critics,fresh,p,"The performances are of the finest, attuned perfectly to the production technique employed, although, besides Welles, the names are unknown to the average motion picture audience."
283,citizen_kane,audience,5.0,p,"One of the greatest films of all times, too bad most people now days have missed seeing this gem."
284,citizen_kane,audience,5.0,p,I've watched this movie probably 10 times. I enjoyed it every time.
285,citizen_kane,audience,5.0,p,"Kids who watch this movie will never know how revolutionary it was.  Every one if its dozens of innovations, from flashback structure to the use of sets with ceilings for additional authenticity, has become standard.  No problem-- there is time enough for them to study these aspects of Citizen Kane's brilliance if they decide to learn more about film history and criticism.  For their first viewing of this brilliant work just let them focus on the story, the dialogue, and the characters, which remain as compelling and contemporary as they were 70 years ago.

Like Willie Stark, Kane begins as a populist and dies corrupt and alone, and we can't help but hope for some explanation of how that happened, as Thompson does.  Both Kane and Stark were based on real-life figures.  Kane was based largely but not completely on William Randolph Hearst, the almost impossibly wealthy heir to the largest gold and silver mine owner in America, who became a powerful publishing magnate.  Kane might also have been based on Welles. himself, only 25 years old when he co-wrote, directed, and starred in this, his first film.  He spent the rest of his life coming up with one excuse or another for why he never came close to that level of achievement again."
286,citizen_kane,audience,5.0,p,The perfect foundation on so many levels of how movies would be made forevermore.
287,citizen_kane,audience,4.0,p,"It's earned its place in film history with its masterful use of lighting, framing, effects and revolutionary story structure but it has turned into something more of a symbol of a masterpiece rather than being the greatest film ever made. It's still miles better than the first Suicide Squad movie though."
288,citizen_kane,audience,0.5,n,it is just that is old and bad(what if i think i like that?)
289,citizen_kane,audience,4.5,p,"So I finally found a way to watch this after having the end ruined for me many years ago by a big mouthed brother of mine before I'd even seen this.  It'd probably have been ruined for my be the internet if my brother had never opened his fat mouth but I digress and am not going to divulge how I finally found a way to see it from a firsthand perspective.

While surprisingly bold, captivating, and entertaining for a film made 80 years ago it still has some spots of a slow and boring nature despite it's technical mastery and innovation"
290,citizen_kane,audience,5.0,p,"The film that revolutionized filmmaking, a name that has become synonymous with magnum opus — a true masterpiece — Citizen Kane is the film student's film for a reason. Yes, I had viewed many YouTube videos about Citizen Kane before ever watching the film, but that didn't take away from the enjoyment; I had actually completely forgotten what ""Rosebud"" meant anyway. Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) is on his deathbed in the palatial Xanadu when he murmurs ""Rosebud"" before expiring. Discovering what this American Titan's last word actually meant propels the film, if only superficially. Welles — who is also the (25 year old!) director — lays it all out in a news-breaking montage of Kane's life, the peaks and valleys, before seeing him as a child playing in the snow. We pretty much know everything that happens 15 minutes-in, now we get to fill in the gaps. Kane is ahead of his time as the newspaper mogul (think Ted Turner, Rupert Murdoch today) who, on day one of taking over The Inquirer, states: ""News is 24 hours"". Thus, changing the way the city — and eventually, the nation — learned about the world, especially considering he filled those pages with the filth we gobble up like a smorgasbord today. Considered a communist to some, a fascist to others (how topical), Kane engages in many of the activities you'd expect a super-wealthy businessman to engage in — expands his empire, ends friendships, ends marriages, begins new marriages, and builds a palace down in Florida with the biggest fuck-off fireplace I've ever seen. Considered a composite character, your opinion on Kane is probably justified and misguided.. That's to say, he's neither hero nor villain. Although Welles didn't necessarily invent many of the shots in his film, he absolutely changed the director's efficacy in storytelling, with too many to count here. A few include: the shot of Kane's parents (Agnes Morehead & Harry Shannon) with the banker (George Coulouris) who becomes his legal guardian as young Kane (Buddy Swan) is playing in the snow, Kane giving a political speech — the most recognizable scene of the film — with a gigantic poster of himself in the background, and the final shot of all the crates housing his treasures. ""One word can't explain a man's life."" Our powerful departing words. Oh, and what is ""Rosebud""? Eh, watch the film to find out. If anything, to pay homage to that gif you probably (sarcastically) use all the time."
291,citizen_kane,audience,2.0,n,"I was shocked to discover I didn't enjoy this film given its notoriously large reputation for being perhaps one of the best. I suppose it must just be a matter of taste, but I fail to see the appeal. I found it to be dry and not having much to say as a film. I didn't find the plot particularly gripping, the characters particularly inspiring, or the performances particularly outstanding. The best way I can describe it is there clearly is an element of Citizen Kane I fail to appreciate that others often do, but I fail to see what that element is."
292,citizen_kane,audience,4.0,p,It was an amazing film but not something i would call the greatest of all time
293,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Powerful and life-affirming...JULIA offers a satisfying repast, even for non-foodies."
294,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,"This charming, cheering and deeply affectionate Julia Child documentary is as enthusiastic as its subject, and that's saying something."
295,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,Julia is a good documentary film about a very deserving subject.
296,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,"As in their earlier films, Cohen and West are especially talented at elevating this noteworthy woman's life and legacy to more than just what she's best known for."
297,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,Julia Child is so fascinating that the biggest flaw with the documentary is that it feels like it only brushes the surface in the film's 95 minute run time -- leaving you wanting more.
298,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,There are some lovely moments here.
299,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,"...a surprisingly incisive documentary that, while perhaps a bit too short in places, succeeds in its efforts to humanize Child, bringing fresh color to a titan of American TV."
300,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,"One gets the sense that Cohen and West wouldn't make a movie about a woman they didn't deeply admire. ""Julia"" follows that tradition, and their affection for their subject is irresistible. Bon appetit."
301,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,It does the job well.
302,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,"A lovely, intimate look at the life and cultural significance of an equally charming woman. Loved it from beginning to end. Don't watch it while hungry! [Review in Spanish]"
303,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,"The film does a wonderful job of capturing Julia's rich personality and love of food and cooking techniques, and as a time capsule reminding us how much mass-produced, preservative-filled junk we ate in the 1950s and '60s."
304,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Julia serves up a well-rounded exploration of Julia Child's long career and life, and does so in a charming, affectionate way."
305,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,"""Julia,"" a brisk documentary survey of Julia Child's life, is warmly admiring. This makes sense, as there's lots to admire."
306,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,"This doc has encouraged this critic to - someday soon - pick up ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" and actually use an appliance that others refer to as a stove."
307,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,"""Julia"" is full of irresistible clips and interviews with its subject, trilling and burbling with her trademark enthusiasm, reminding her viewers that anything was possible and that mistakes are how cooks learn."
308,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Julia is a thorough documentary, concise in a way that's ideal for the casual couch surfer. Like Child, the film's a delight, but slightly unlike her, Julia doesn't bring any new techniques to the table of biographical documentaries."
309,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,This overstuffed French feast -- just in time to whet Thanksgiving appetites -- hungers for more real documentary juice while getting by on mouth-watering offerings from the grand TV cook.
310,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,A leader in America's food movement is rightfully praised and immortalized in a doc that is a pleasure to watch. You can almost smell the Coq au Vin simmering on the stove.
311,julia_2021,critics,fresh,p,Lots of footage from her earliest PBS shows in the 1960s plus luscious recreations of such staples as boeuf bourguignon and pear tart make for irresistible viewing.
312,julia_2021,critics,rotten,n,"The food cinematography is the closest Julia ever gets to feeling like a real film. The rest is just good information delivered with no panache, a dish with no flavor that somehow still leaves a sour taste in your mouth."
313,julia_2021,audience,3.5,p,We enjoyed the documentary/bio of Julia Child very much.I had no idea what an affect she had on getting people interested in cooking and getting them to eat well.
314,julia_2021,audience,5.0,p,"Refreshing, joyful, interesting, informative"
315,julia_2021,audience,5.0,p,Well told and entertaining account of Julia's life and influence on American cooking.
316,julia_2021,audience,5.0,p,"Thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.  Julia Child was an icon, a delight, a force.  She exuded pure love and total commitment in her life and passions.  Highly recommend this movie, ESPECIALLY for those who never knew her.  Everyone should know Julia Child!"
317,julia_2021,audience,5.0,p,Delectable and scrumptious!  Julia is a National Treasure and soooo interesting!
318,julia_2021,audience,5.0,p,entertaining movie gave me a whole new appreciation for Julia Child and all she did to spark an interest in food and cooking in the US.
319,julia_2021,audience,4.0,p,"well done review of an interesting life. I wasn't aware Julia was an activist for Planned Parenthood and Aids. She certainly paved the way for women to be taken seriously, especially in the culinary arts."
320,julia_2021,audience,5.0,p,Wonderful movie about Julia Child! Excellent music! Nothing I didnt like!
321,julia_2021,audience,5.0,p,I saw JULIA in a packed mid-day screening... and there was so much enthusiasm and laughter!  It's an excellent documentary about a remarkable persona.  Kudos to all the makers.
322,julia_2021,audience,5.0,p,Excellent!  Just finished My life in France this is a great companion to it!
323,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,An impressive technical achievement. [Full review in Spanish]
324,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"The truth is that the film is presented as entertainment, but not so naively. [Full review in Spanish]"
325,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Only half a good movie. When mucking around with unfunny body-swap nonsense, it falls flat. When pondering the deep passions that give us reasons to live, it excels."
326,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"It's comedic, moving and the animation is pristine. [But] [i]t's like animation meets Get Out, meets Magical Negro."
327,soul_2020,critics,rotten,n,I wish the film focused on and channeled more of its energy into that relationship and Joe's own life rather than his bump-in with 22.
328,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Soul [is] a wildly ambitious, sometimes brilliant, gorgeously animated (in every sense of the word) film, all while breaking one of Disney/Pixar's biggest glass ceilings: an animated film featuring a Black lead character."
329,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,[Soul] opens as a metaphysical theme park and morphs into a slapstick body-swap comedy ... It's a quietly joyous send-off to a relentlessly bleak year.
330,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,It's solid Pixar working their magic with a couple rough spots but nothing to truly sour the experience.
331,soul_2020,critics,rotten,n,"Soul cannot make its discrete parts work as a whole of something when it feels like it is stuck in its own ""Great Before""."
332,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"With a simple, yet life-altering moral, wrapped in the greatness that we now expect from Pixar, it's no surprise as to why Soul is achieving a momentous amount of awards, while simultaneously being a perfect family voyage."
333,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,An animated film that infects me when it tackles with sensitivity and grace a rather clever concept that celebrates the value of human life. [Full review in Spanish]
334,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"Even if the story hits too many familiar beats to completely succeed, the animation is absolutely stunning."
335,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,The film beautifully illustrates the communion of life's spark and human purpose. [Full Review in Spanish]
336,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,The shape-shifting keeps Soul light on its feet and keeps your eyes wide open.
337,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"An animated masterpiece about a soul's adventure that will get you thinking and talking about the life and the afterlife, your passions and purpose, and the spark that sets it all going."
338,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,The film's multilayered charms - a Pixar hallmark - seamlessly blend heart and humor in a package that parents will be able to enjoy alongside their kids.
339,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,Directors Pete Docter and Kemp Powers manage to land these [existential] ideas. [Full review in Spanish]
340,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"A smart, tender and contemplative piece of stunning filmmaking all on its own terms."
341,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"This may be Pixar's most 'adult' film, in terms of its themes, its mostly middle-aged characters, its sometimes experimental and -- yes -- jazzy animation (heaven is run by characters who are nothing but squiggly lines), and its soundtrack."
342,soul_2020,critics,fresh,p,"With its fragmented narrative, it feels almost like a shorts collection jazz riff on the theme of existence and metaphysics, plus quite a few of the jokes feel extremely American-specific and won't translate well for international audiences."
343,soul_2020,audience,5.0,p,"I loved the movie, the animation, the story's creativity and mainly because they used Jazz as the main character's musical taste"
344,soul_2020,audience,5.0,p,The best movie of all time!
345,soul_2020,audience,4.0,p,"A perfectly crafted universe animated in best Pixar traditions lets the story dive deep into a metaphysical realm of before- and after-life. There are some beautiful and well thought ideas and concepts, although it is hard to say that all of them are aligned well enough to represent a coherent system.
Otherwise it is a perfect family story packed in a great music box and the best animation and visual effects imaginable."
346,soul_2020,audience,3.5,p,"The film is full of surprises and shows the extremely pronounced creativity of the makers of Pixar. The film raises exciting questions, not all of which are unfortunately answered. Especially the middle part of the film stretches a bit in length. I would have liked to see more of the Great Before. And especially the topic of jazz music me off, because the music is very exhausting, especially when it accompanies you throughout the film. The end was really disappointing for me. It seems like Pixar didn't dare to let the character die, but that would have rounded off the movie perfectly for me. All in all entertaining, but not a new masterpiece from Pixar."
347,soul_2020,audience,3.0,p,Like the concept and especially the message is great. But again we have a POC character that's human for like 5 min of the movie.
348,soul_2020,audience,5.0,p,"Don't make the mistake of thinking this is a ""kids' movie"" or some sort of musical as the trailers' may lead you to believe. It's funny, cute, and thought provoking. And literally any age can enjoy it. Pixar delivers another masterpiece."
349,soul_2020,audience,3.0,p,"Not one of the better Pixar films, but somewhat interesting.  It is a bit like Inside Out, but more to it.  Typical of Disney Pixar it is a feel good movie with some decent music and crazy fantasy adventure."
350,soul_2020,audience,4.5,p,"A breath of fresh air for all animated films. Youth and adults alike can revel in Soul's powerful message. A template that should be saved for the future, and a benchmark for all forthcoming cartoon fare."
351,soul_2020,audience,5.0,p,"Soul is worth every ounce in Gold. The movie has a very charismatic approach towards being alive. The characters perfectly sum up the perspective of someone who lost their meaning of life. It is very vivid, it is very lively. Everyone should definitely watch Soul atleast once, and especially when they aren't sure of their purpose to live. It sets a tone for looking ahead. Simply amazing!"
352,soul_2020,audience,5.0,p,"This movie hits every box on my list that is needed for a what a perfect movie should be. The animation is beautiful, the actor do an amazing job bringing these character to life, and the message is simple and sweet, but powerful that will affect everyone trying to figure out what they want to do in life."
353,knives_out,critics,fresh,p,The dialogue is... to die for. It doesn't get any better than this.
354,knives_out,critics,fresh,p,An ingenious new thriller that takes the bones of Agatha Christie and brilliantly updates it for the most purely entertaining movie of the year.
355,knives_out,critics,fresh,p,"Bubbling merrily in its humanity, and impishly clear in exposing societal rot through the cleverest of cinema lenses - a whodunit."
356,knives_out,critics,fresh,p,"Knives Out is a thoroughly satisfying murder mystery populated with well-drawn, idiosyncratic characters who collectively present a tapestry of modern America."
357,knives_out,critics,fresh,p,"A thrilling, expertly-crafted whodunit..."
358,knives_out,critics,fresh,p,"A great example of what genre cinema can be on its best days, Rian Johnson's whodunit takes the rules, bends them, plays with them, reverses them and then realigns them so smoothly..."
359,knives_out,critics,fresh,p,"Knives Out is a self-aware, stylised farce that has a great time - and pulls you along with it."
360,knives_out,critics,fresh,p,Knives Out is a great antidote to the Oscar contenders and family fare that dominate this time of year. It's a purely fun time at the movies thanks to its strong story and fantastic performances.
361,knives_out,critics,fresh,p,"It's an old-fashioned set-up but slowly echoes of modern-day issues of immigration, deportation and white entitlement are introduced to add edge to the story."
362,knives_out,critics,fresh,p,It's highly unlikely you're going to get through the movie without it completely getting its hooks into you.
363,knives_out,critics,rotten,n,"A predictable whodunit that seems to want to act as homage to the great mystery features of the past, but ends up feeling like a recycled plot from a lesser Agatha Christie novel."
364,knives_out,critics,fresh,p,"It gets goofier when the explanations unfold, yet the resolution and the parting shots are incredibly satisfying."
365,knives_out,critics,fresh,p,"Funny and smart, this is one of the wittiest and most entertaining films of the year."
366,knives_out,critics,fresh,p,Knives Out provides mysterious thrills while offering a timely critique of entitled white privilege.
367,knives_out,critics,fresh,p,"Everything old can be new again, and Knives Out demonstrates this brilliantly due to Rian Johnson's airtight script, assured direction and the commitment from the crazily talented cast. Foul play has never been this much fun."
368,knives_out,critics,fresh,p,"This whodunit is light entertainment at its finest, a surprising movie with an enjoyable sense of complication and a dream cast."
369,knives_out,critics,fresh,p,"Rian Johnson proves himself to be one of contemporary cinema's most creative, inspired, disciplined, and downright entertaining filmmakers working today."
370,knives_out,critics,fresh,p,This modern twist on an old classic understands that the genre's formulas are fertile ground on which to hang strident critiques of privilege and class.
371,knives_out,critics,fresh,p,"Rian Johnson (""Looper"") delivers a star-studded romp that rises above the standard ""Clue"" whodunnit by revealing the culprit early on, then watching the aftermath."
372,knives_out,critics,fresh,p,"Rian Johnson's Knives Out is an energetic blast, not only a landmark undertaking in skill, craft, nuance, and entertaining hilarity but makes a confident and exceptional call to be considered as one of the best films of the year."
373,knives_out,audience,4.5,p,"Pretty boring until almost the end, but the plot twist and how smart Blanc is just makes it amazing

Loved it, despite the fact I'm not a big fan of murder mysteries. Classic plot end: complicated but unexpected. Had to get used to Daniel Craig's southern accent. Most enjoyable movie."
376,knives_out,audience,4.0,p,The twists where actually surprising. I won't say anymore just watch it  if you like a clever detective-story.
377,knives_out,audience,3.5,p,"Not bad, nice to see Daniel Craig taking on other roles after 007. It took a while to get used to his accent, but he still looks very much European somehow. The story is alright, nice twist (although expected) in the end. Good acting from other supporting actors."
378,knives_out,audience,3.0,p,Not as good as I expected it to be.
379,knives_out,audience,4.5,p,"this a classic who dunnit, with a an amazing setup and even better payoff. A definite must-watch"
380,knives_out,audience,4.5,p,"Writer/director Rain Johnson recovers following his divisive Star Wars film (personally, I enjoyed his darker Star Wars vision) with a wonderfully smart and witty murder mystery. With a stellar cast that includes Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, Christopher Plummer, and Daniel Craig as Detective Benoit Blanc (the lead of a soon to be film series), it's hard to imagine this film not being great. The set up is standard Agatha Christie with rich patriarch Plummer found dead and all of the family angling for his fortune being suspect. Although the set-up is standard, Johnson subverts murder mystery conventions, with the cause of death revealed early in the film, but best of all it's the audience who has all the facts and Daniel Craig's detective left in the dark. I don't want to spoil the story, but MINOR SPOILER ALTERT, much of the film's suspense boils down to the fate of a sympathetic protagonist. Overall, if you love a crackling good mystery or wonderful ensemble casts, don't miss this film. BONUS FILM SUGGESTION! If you enjoyed ""Knives Out"" you should check out Rain Johnson's first film as writer/director, ""Brick."" It's another wildly fun murder mystery, though it's in the mold of Raymond Chandler with a high school Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a noirish teenage Phillip Marlow."
381,knives_out,audience,4.5,p,"Knives out is a thrilling, dramatic and great movie that everyone should watch. This clearly shows how murder mystery movies should be. The story line up is very interessting to watch and the plot twist is what makes the movie so good, perhaps one of the best plot twists in a movie. Each of the actors deliver their roles perfectly and i love the dialogue in it. Great movie, can't wait for the sequel!

382,knives_out,audience,3.5,p,"Unexpectedly brilliant, ever wondered how cluedo would unravel in movie form?"
383,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,But the bigger problem with the film is that it suffers from the girlboss-ification of female characters that has seeped into media over the few years.
384,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,A fabulous director and two awesome stars battle their way through a wonky script.
385,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,"While it improves in the second half, Black Widow is too uneven and generic to recommend. Telling a story about freewill and liberation is ironically littered with too many artistic compromises."

387,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Johansson is good, better than she's been given the opportunity to be before with this role, but she - like Black Widow is still stunted in many ways by the vision the MCU has for Natasha which makes this feel more elegiac than energetic."
388,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Marvel finally releases the Black Widow origin story, but how many more years before we see another one?"
389,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Natasha deserved a better memorial.
390,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Bland spy hooey. Although Pugh is a standout.
391,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Black Widow is worth seeing for Florence Pugh, the free-fall action sequence, and anything involving Taskmaster before it's revealed who is under the mask. The film mostly feels like it was done better by the films it was supposedly influenced by."
392,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,The rawness made for a spirited episode that every Marvel fan needs to listen to.
393,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"It would've been amazing to receive this movie 4 years ago, now it's just too late. That doesn't mean it's not a worthy closure for a much beloved character. [Full review in Spanish]"
394,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,The positives do outweigh the negatives but it does frustratingly end up feeling middle-of-the-road in terms of the MCU output.
395,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Black Widow is not as tedious and self-serious an entry as some of them. But that is setting the bar low.
396,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,What ensues is a film that isn't interested in planting seeds for future Marvel movies -- which is actually a refreshing change of pace.
397,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Pugh is the only victory for this vanilla Marvel movie. [...] Fans are left wondering what could have been. And Johansson is left fighting a lawsuit against the world's biggest entertainment behemoth - a mission that seems too much even for Natasha.
398,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Black Widow achieves the unthinkable and dethrones Thor: The Dark World as the worst film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
399,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,"The spotlight should firmly be on her, or so you would have thought, but for all its acrobatic female kick-ass baddery poor old Natasha Romanoff has to share that limelight with her highly skilled ""family"" to bring down the patriarchy."
400,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,Almost completely lacking in Black Widow is any sense of outrage over the grotesque violations of human rights and human dignity at the root of the whole premise of the film.
401,black_widow_2021,critics,rotten,n,"The problem with Black Widow is that the whole ordeal feels like an obligatory afterthought, simply going through the motions with only a perfunctory sense of charm."
402,black_widow_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Black Widow has everything going on: dysfunctional families, sibling rivalry, a fatuous Russian superhero, a cackling Bond villain and an army of female assassins. What more do you want?"
403,black_widow_2021,audience,1.0,n,Boring and irrelevant story. Attempts at Russian accents were distracting throughout. Relying too much on a VFX heavy ending to the point where it was too much / action was too unbelievable at the end even for a film like this.
404,black_widow_2021,audience,5.0,p,o que mas me convenceu foi a trajetória na viúva Negra. a o gancho de ramificações para novo heróis. foi incrível.
405,black_widow_2021,audience,1.5,n,"The most generic, predictable and boring movie I've seen from the MCU in a long time, something very forgettable that is sustained in the pure participation of its actors, in that case I would have paid for a family sitcom with Scarlet Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbor and Rachel Weisz."
406,black_widow_2021,audience,3.5,p,"Pretty good, the younger sister does a great job.  The movie is full of light-hearted family dynamics that are funny.  Scarlet did a great job the problem was with Task Master.  Couple that with the flying or falling for like 30 mins really.  Step it up Marvel."
407,black_widow_2021,audience,4.0,p,"A long overdue, fantastic solo movie. Taskmaster was a bit of a missed opportunity, and the film can get slightly too ambitious at times. Neither of these complaints detract much from what is a very solid, satisfying examination of Natasha's past."
408,black_widow_2021,audience,1.5,n,"Uninteresting story, badly told, decently acted and horrendously edited"
409,black_widow_2021,audience,3.0,p,"Nothing new or inventive, but not every Marvel movie gets to be great. Some just need to check the boxes and fill out the time in between Spider-Man movies."
410,black_widow_2021,audience,2.5,n,"This movie came more than a decade too late. Also this is not a Black Widow movie, it's a movie to set up her replacement in the MCU.
Another predictable marvel movie that does nothing to push the envelope where the stars have plot armor and according to the laws of physic and basic biology should have died more than once. And that has some mindboggling weird plot choices. 
The acting was great but the only thing that kept me watching was Florence Pugh great and both emotional and funny performance."
411,black_widow_2021,audience,3.5,p,"This feels like a phase one movie - It's not bad at all, but that title sequence showed me that with a higher age rating it could have been one of the most interesting MCU movies, which does make the end product sting a little.
As it is - it's a decent MCU movie. The chemistry between the cast was great, the action was pretty good."
412,black_widow_2021,audience,3.5,p,Great action movie with many funny lines.
413,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,It's told with so much humor and heart.
414,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,"If you're expecting a straightforward biography of Mister Rogers, you might be disappointed...if, however, you hope to be inspired by a story about the way Mister Rogers still affects the world today, you will love this film."
415,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,"It's an airtight little fable of fingers linked in a gesture of friendship, one to one to one and on and on and on forever. Start small, with whomever is standing in front of you, and work from there."
416,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,It's a typically reliable turn from the two-time Oscar winner and he carries the movie.
417,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,"Make sure you've got your tissues, then dig out the companion documentary Won't You Be My Neighbour? and the 1998 article that inspired it all. You can thank me later."
418,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood pays tribute to Fred Rogers in an understated and heartfelt way that he would surely appreciate.
419,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,A quietly moving retort to modern cynicism.
420,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,The movie is quite a bit riskier than you might expect from a biopic about Mr. Rogers.
421,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,rotten,n,Viewers will surely never get lost in the performance; it's always obvious that Hanks is playing a part (though he's thoroughly watchable in every scene).
422,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,"""It has been crafted into something unique between being moving and heartbreaking"""
423,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,To say this hits all the right notes would be an understatement.
424,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,Without a doubt [Tom Hanks] was the best candidate to play Rogers in this pleasant but predictable film about kindness. [Full review in Spanish]
425,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,"Even if it doesn't inspire you to be the Mister Rogers you want to see in the world, it should hopefully serve as a reminder to be kind even when it's hard to."
426,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,"The film's strangeness makes this convincing, and it's what saves it from gooeyness. One of the most unexpected and evocative scenes in any film last year is in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood."
427,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,"A film that, like the interesting director and writer Marielle Heller's previous works... investigates the soul of its characters with a special affection, despite showing their weaknesses and imperfections without any shame.

428,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,critics,fresh,p,"Under any other director, this could have been a misguided misstep. But here, as a fitting tribute to Fred Rogers' legacy, with all of its quirky ingenuity and resolute application, just illustrates how truly special this film is."

Whenever one is struggling, find forgiveness and love. Love others and self. Thank you Mr Rogers for being a bright light in this magical thing we call life."
438,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,audience,5.0,p,"A beautiful,  sweet, well placed film. And it has perfect acting by Tom Hanks,  of course.

This movie is quite a change from big superhero blockbusters. Yet it still portrays a real life super hero."
439,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,audience,4.0,p,I thought it was very well done.  It was interesting how it told us about Fred Rogers mostly in the context of his interaction with the journalist Tom Junod.
440,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,audience,5.0,p,"This movie could not be any better.
An outstanding performance by everyone in a superbly well crafted movie."
441,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,audience,4.0,p,"I can't think of anyone else who could have embodied this role so magnificently as Tom Hanks.  I grew up watching Mr. Rogers, and found this to be such a moving and uplifiting take on not just who he was, but the impact he had on others."
442,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,audience,3.5,p,"Idk, once you've seen the real Mr. Rodgers once no one can do him justice not even Tom Hanks."

445,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,"Black lives matter in the quiet, contemplative Moonlight, but let's not stop there."
446,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,A majestic film of gentle moments and pregnant silences.
447,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,What makes Moonlight so amazing is that it almost shouldn't work at all. It is a character study with no lead actor.
448,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,Moonlight displays the kind of empathy and humanity that we desperately need right now.
449,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,A movie that beats with a very human heart while subverting expectations with almost every scene.
450,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,"Moonlight is one of the best movies of the year from a new and exciting voice in cinema. With his second film, Berry Jenkins shows a maturity beyond his years..."
451,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,"A fascinating character study that is sometimes tender, sometimes ferocious, yet always profound."
452,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,[Delivers] as both a remarkable exercise in sensuousness and a wholly affecting look at suffocated identity.
453,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,"A deconstruction of traditional masculinity as a societal prison, [Moonlight] never asks for compassion -- it entrusts its viewers to contain it within themselves."
454,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,"Right from the beginning, Moonlight makes its impact known. You're watching a reaffirmation of black culture by telling it from a different perspective and understanding."
455,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,To not understand the life depicted here is to not have humanity.
456,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,"The dialogue is exquisite, but the most powerful moments come from silence... intimate moments to reflect and comprehend Chiron's reality. [Full review in Spanish]"
457,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,"Unique and universal, bleak and hopeful, compassionate and humane, Moonlight eschews ordinary answers, constructs, and definitions."
458,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,"Relying on intensely naturalistic performances and situations, it somehow manages to smuggle in moments of interior lyricism without breaking the flow of the film[.]"
459,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,It's the social commentary on an intimately sincere human reality. [Full review in Spanish]
460,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,It's very good.
461,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,"A less pretentious, more poignant and powerful Boyhood."
462,moonlight_2016,critics,fresh,p,The fact that Moonlight as a film even exists is impressive; but that it's as near-perfect a film as you'll see all year is miraculous.
463,moonlight_2016,audience,5.0,p,"This movie is phenomenal, Mahershala Ali is too good in this role. A very important movie to watch."

465,moonlight_2016,audience,5.0,p,"An extravagantly moving masterpiece that will touch the majority of viewers. A heartbreaking look at identity, sexuality and masculinity, that feels immensely personal, but at the same time universal, with its tackling of global issues such as: prostitution, drug abuse, discrimination etc…"
466,moonlight_2016,audience,0.5,n,"Just terrible, slow and completely uninteresting."
467,moonlight_2016,audience,5.0,p,There's no words to describe how wonderful this film is. Gloriously brilliant!
468,moonlight_2016,audience,0.5,n,"This movie is horrible and overrated. I'm sorry, but it was just super boring and depressing. I will say that Mahershala Ali deserved his Oscar, but he was only in the movie for a little bit, but then once he was gone the movie just got really dull and depressing.

This definitely should not have won best picture.
I feel like it won at the Oscars because of ""diversity."" It's about a gay African American. I'm all for diversity, but merit should come first. La la land was clearly superior in every way."
469,moonlight_2016,audience,5.0,p,"Let me just start off by saying, I love everything about this movie! The way Berry Jenkins uses lighting, Camera angles, and camera focus to tell the story, is a true piece of art. There are so many amazing parts of this movie but, I wanna talk about one scene in particular, with Juan and Chiron sitting at the dining room table, at Juan's House. The way the camera focuses on young Chiron at the table makes the sadness in the air emplified, with his chapped lips and puppy dog eyes staring at the camera and tunnel vision goes into effect. You also feel the effects of Juan as well in this scene, all you can see is his blurred out face and elbows on the table, Juan is on the verge of tears, just like me when I saw this scene for the first time. With all of this Beautiful cinematic work in only the first part of three, The viewers already knew this was going to be a work of art. In part two of the film there were many depressing moments during his teenage years, his mom verbally abuses him numerous times throughout this part of the movie, Whenever these incidents occur, the camera goes into the point of view of Chiron and everything zones out, with his mom distortedly tantruming and screaming in front of him. The way the camera follows Chiron's point of view, let's you get a feel for what he goes through and really shows you how it feels to be in his shoes. In the third, and final part, Chiron is a grown man and his mother is in a rehabilitation center. She is off the drugs but Chiron doesn't normally visit her because she always asks for ""favors"" from him. When he goes to visit, the camera angle presents as if you are on their shoulder, looking at the other. Giving you that point of view helps you take in every facial expression and understand how sedimental this visit really is. These scenes and many more, have made me love this movie and grow as a viewer, focusing on the cinematic works in scenes of movies. I recommend this movie to anybody looking for something compelling."
470,moonlight_2016,audience,3.5,p,Moonlight is a decent film. It is about a young African-American man who grapples with his identity and sexuality. Mahershala Ali and Trevante Rhodes give good performances. The screenplay is a little slow in places. Barry Jenkins did an alright job directing this movie. I liked this motion picture because of the drama.
471,moonlight_2016,audience,3.0,p,"I thought it was good, but i dont really have too much to say about it. it had a good meaning behind it but not a lot really happened throughout"
472,moonlight_2016,audience,4.0,p,"Barry Jenkins magnificent debut in three acts is a startling second feature of self discovery and self acceptance, with terrific performances. Deserving Best Picture winner at the Oscars, it's probably safe to say that, although completely differing films in every respect, without Moonlight, Parasite (UK-2020) wouldn't have taken the same gong this year."
473,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"The new locations are vast and mind-boggling, the sets beautifully decorated and detailed, and the creatures more impressively monstrous."

475,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"An epic showdown in gorgeous 3D, packing an emotional punch, this cast and crew should take their final bow with pride before their devoted fans."
476,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"[The film] ends the series so beautifully, and shows such reverence for the books that inspired and affected them so deeply."
477,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,Good film directed for a teenage audience in which not only is magic taught but also how stereotypes affect it while the film itself recreates some British stereotypes. [Review in Spanish]
478,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"Yates strikes a pitch-perfect balance between rousing action, pathos, tenderness and even humor."
479,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"This final chapter of the beloved franchise is a satisfying end to the series, even if it falls short of the promise teased in its slightly superior predecessor."
480,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"It's true it is very different from the book... Nevertheless, I like this movie. I think it ends the series in a very satisfying way."
481,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"I was impressed with the incredible amount of edge-of-your-seat action, the brilliant ways in which they worked the 3D F/X in, and just the way the whole thing came together."
482,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"To those who have loved this journey throughout, it seems a perfect last look at this magical world with a human heart."

484,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"David Yates finally gives us the Harry Potter film we have been waiting for; a beautifully shot, incredibly loyal final chapter that mixes heartfelt emotion, strong performances and miraculous action."
485,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"Like the very best fairy tales, Harry Potter offers us a burning vision of our own world, with goodness and evil helpfully labeled."
486,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"The effects and acting are top notch, with a vast cast providing well-developed background characters."
487,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,The danger is seething as both sides battle between extravagant set pieces and eye-catching special effects.
488,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"Deathly Hallows part 2 struck all the right notes of action, adventure, friendship, courage and love."
489,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"We're left just as we should be, spellbound in darkness, with our Harry Potter 3-D glasses."
490,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"Certainly Hollywood will circle back to this beloved fantasy series, but it's hard to imagine that any future film adaptations could be more lovingly crafted, or more beloved by fans."
491,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"Not the most exciting film of the series, but Yates manages to establish the mature, sombre tone needed to lead into the final film."
492,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,critics,fresh,p,"The final instalment, Deathly Hallows Part 2, is a bravura duel between good and evil. It's also a cathartic, occasionally clunky nostalgiafest."
493,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,audience,5.0,p,"Great action, feeling like a complete story and loads of emotional moments and rewarding all the fans old and new, making it a great end to the franchise."

496,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,audience,4.5,p,"This was a satisfying and magical conclusion.  The message is that there is darkness in all of us that we can overcome.  The contrast of this to the first film, Sorcerer's Stone, is otherworldly."

498,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,audience,5.0,p,"OMG. I think, next to 1917 and Back To The Future, this is one of my favorite movies ever. Maybe it's just because I am a huge Harry Potter fan (not only the movies, also the books), but also because it's just an amazing movie. The visual effects are great, the best from all the movies. Also the acting is phenominal, also the performance of Daniel Radcliffe, even though I didn't like his acting a lot in the other HP movies, in this one he's got the hang of it. Good job David Yates!
Absolute Must See!!"
499,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,audience,5.0,p,"Maybe I'm a little biased since I grow up watching this series, but this is a perfect ending to the story."
500,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,audience,4.5,p,"An almost perfect finale. Everything wraps up beautifully, and almost leaves you wanting more because it is so good.
It's all been leading up to this, and what a ride it has been. And what a prefect ending to the ride as well! Once again, they brought back so many characters from the previous movies, and made them feel so natural in their inclusion. What a masterpiece!"
501,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,audience,5.0,p,Amazing.  Extraordinary movie.
502,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,audience,5.0,p,The best Harry Potter film!
503,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"What Jackson's storytelling lacks in coherency - a major problem for non-Tolkienites with the first film - he makes up for with a new-found sense of urgency and a richer blend of drama, humour and human emotion."
504,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"In terms of battle sequences alone, it's hard to find one that's quite as daunting and absorbing as the Battle for Helm's Deep in The Two Towers..."
505,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,The climactic battle of Helm's Deep - though it still leaves much to be resolved for the final part - is a breathtakingly colossal skirmish in the rain and mud and fog.
506,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"Call it a pretty good film and I'll agree with you. Call it a great one, and I will beg to differ."
507,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,It also has... layers of political dynamics going on which I actually thought was pretty interesting.
508,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,The Two Towers succeeds like few other middle installments do in serving as both a satisfying benchmark that ties the introduction and conclusion to this trilogy together.
509,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,I think this one might be the actual best of the franchise and it's all because of the Ents.
510,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,this three hour epic is one of those few films where you leave feeling they could have spent even more time with story explanation and exposition
511,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,These Tolkien films have a weight and seriousness that very few sword-and-sorcery pictures of the past 30-odd years have attained.
512,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,What an eyeful it is. This is probably the greatest battlepiece composed for the screen since Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible.
513,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"This film is a towering achievement, and the next installment can't come soon enough."
514,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"This is, I can say without fear of exaggerating, one of the great films of all time."
515,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"Much of the movie is exciting. But none of it is as satisfying as what Jackson was able to create in Fellowship, the first film."
516,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"While the acting is once more solid throughout, even with the Shakespearean Ian McKellen given too little to do as the good wizard Gandalf, the most impressive performance of all comes from digital magicians who created the wretched Gollum, Smeagol."
517,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,rotten,n,The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is like being trapped in a nerd's bedroom.
518,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"While some people think this surpasses the original, I don't. The storylines are fractured and geographically and narratively it's sometimes hard to figure out what's going on... but the positives are many."
519,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"The Two Towers is a satisfying and wholly gripping drama in its own right. Inevitably, Janus-like, it looks back to the Shire, and forward to the hour of doom. And after three hours, you will too."
520,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"When Gandalf arrives with reinforcements, descending a near-vertical slope using horses where you or I would use snowboards, the spirit of triumphant rampage is something rarely glimpsed since the days of Olivier and Henry V."
521,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"To live up to expectations, The Two Towers only had to be as good as its predecessor -- and, astoundingly, it's better."
522,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,critics,fresh,p,"Most moviegoers will leave buzzing about the climactic Battle of Helm's Deep. But in my eyes, this is Gollum's show more than anyone else's, even the special-effects wizards behind the scenes."
523,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,audience,4.0,p,"A perfect continuation of the story, characters develop and sets up a final chapter you are begging to see."
524,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,audience,5.0,p,"Best sequel of all times, wow!!!"
525,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_two_towers,audience,4.5,p,"Being a purist who's read the book at least 15 times, I might not be able to give anything related to it five stars, but this film comes as close as anything probably ever will. There are some scenes that are so astounding as to boggle the mind. The acting is mostly perfect, and the story is rousing and emotionally resonant. I give is 95%, just like the other two installments. It's a great achievement."

Plus a skateboarding Elf, and a cocky Dwarf have an orc killing contest. It’s a really great second film, though it gets overlooked sometimes compared to the first and the third films."

553,promising_young_woman,audience,4.0,p,"Pretty good, but cheesy at times"
554,promising_young_woman,audience,5.0,p,"The movie Promising Young Women, directed by Emerald Fennel in 2020, starred Carey Mulligan & Bo Burnham. Is about Cassie a empowered feminist women getting revenge on men who took advantage of her best friend while she was drunk. She makes men feel morally wrong for taking advantage of vulnerable women who are blackout drunk, but she acts to be drunk at bars to then trick the men that go after her, and threatens them to not go after women who are drunk just to have sex with them. But her main goal was to go after the guys who raped her best frined by linking up with her past ""friends"" and she blackmails and manipulates people into giving in and feeling guilt for what they did and not speaking up about it.

One aspect that stood out to me would be the music and lighting. Because the music supported the emotions and actions that were going on in the scenes. Especially when she confronts the people that she is looking for and targeting.

I feel like the movie was well made overall and it can seem sort of dark at times. But its a very solid movie that shows the intentions of men that see vulnerable women as a thing they can exploit for their own pleasure. Which happens in the real world and many get away with it because there's no ""proof"" so to say, And I would recommend this to other people of age to watch it because the movie is constantly making you guess what's going to happen next with unexpected turn of events."
555,promising_young_woman,audience,3.5,p,"Let me start by saying trigger warning as this film contains difficult subjects such as rape and assault. The film is dark and unique (sick at times).  Major parts of the plot is predictable, yet an entertaining thriller that will have you wondering how it'll all end."
556,promising_young_woman,audience,5.0,p,"Wow! This movie is absolutely astonishing with surprising plot twists and suspense that makes it hard to breathe. The music is the kicker here. This is by far the most creative use of pop songs in a movie I have ever heard and it just adds another layer of perfection to it. On top of that, the movie is about an important issue and makes you think long after you finished watching it."
557,promising_young_woman,audience,4.5,p,"Promising Young Women is a thriller/comedy directed by Emerald Fennell in 2020. This film stars Carey Mulligan, Bo Burnham, Alison Brie, and Clancey Brown. Promising Young Women takes place in suburban Ohio. Cassie Thomas who is played by Carey Mulligan was a medical student. She dropped out of medical school and she worked at a coffee shop after. She dropped out to comfort her best friend, Nina. Nina was also a medical student, but she was raped by a fellow colleague. No one believed Nina's story of rape, except Cassie. Nina eventually fell into a depression and this led to her death, suicide. Nina's death traumatized Cassie. This caused the beginning of Cassie's revenge story where she would go to bars alone, act drunk, and then she would lure men to see if they would take advantage of her. That is where everything all began.
	One thing that stood out to me was how the medical students Ryan and Al both knew that they did wrong, but they made the excuse that they were ""just kids"". Al raped Nina while she was drunk and passed out. Ryan took part in the assault by watching and he recorded everything when he had the power to stop it. They were both grown men with successful medical practices, but they both acted like they should have been exempt from all the trauma that they caused since they were ""just kids"". 
I really liked the film, Promising Young Women because the director, Emerald Fennell, did a good job of keeping the audience guessing. There were many plot twists throughout the film. I really believed that Bo Burnham's character, Ryan, was going to change Cassie for the better. I thought that her nights of going out to bars and acting drunk were going to come to an end because of him. He really liked her and she started to like him as well, but everything was ruined when Cassie found out that he was involved in Nina's assault. This really surprised me because I thought he was good. I really liked how throughout the film I could not tell if Cassie was depressed or actually psychotic. The quality of the movie was good, the lighting was different from all the other films that I have watched. I would recommend this movie to young viewers like myself because it shows a very serious topic in a somewhat comedic way. I would give this film 4.5/5 stars."

562,promising_young_woman,audience,4.0,p,"What goes around comes around.  An obsession never ends well.  Carey is on a quest to right a wrong from her friend and her past.  The men and the women who laughed at a girl being drugged drunk, raped and beaten are sick, beyond sick.  Girls watch it and alcohol ALWAYS clouds the picture and you hope you have a nice guy.  I took several drunken girls home in my time and believe me I could of but what I could not do afterward would be to live with myself if I did.  However, how many guys and women could???"

585,mad_max_fury_road,audience,5.0,p,"""I LIVE, I DIE, I LIVE AGAIN...!''

Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) directed by George Miller is a post-apocalyptic science-fiction masterpiece. A truly amazing cinematic achievement.

It feels like George Miller has been studying for this piece of art since the release of ''Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome''(1985) and finally mastered how to make the perfect Mad Max movie.

A modern epic that is completely flawless from the technical standpoint. A movie to watch in the cinema. A dazzling cinematography with some of the most beautifully crafted shots in cinema history. A score that is extremely effective and drags you down to the Fury Road. An editing that is sent from above and that made this picture have some of the best action sequences of all time.

A fantastic screenplay that shows how passionate Miller is about this apocalyptic world. A very effective and emotional way of telling an epic story.

Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the best movies of the 21st century and takes part in the list of my favorite action movies of all time.

586,mad_max_fury_road,audience,5.0,p,A classic that will be handed down to generations!
587,mad_max_fury_road,audience,5.0,p,"An epic wonderfully acted, action packed masterpiece with some of the best most intense scenes and music I have ever seen! Loved every minute!!!"
588,mad_max_fury_road,audience,4.5,p,"After the saga endured a long hiatus, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" returns for a roller coaster ride through the deserts of post-apocalyptic Australia. The combination of intense action and an impeccable soundtrack compensates for a simplistic plot. Charlize Theron delivers a headstrong disposition as a war captain who goes AWOL with five female slaves, eventually joining Max in their desperate attempt to escape the thumb of a tyrannical dictator who rules over the wasteland. Her role proves equally substantial to her male counterpart. A conservative amount of CGI in favor of practical sequences contributes to the engaging visuals in the special effects department. Newcomers to the franchise are forgiven, owing to the film being essentially a reboot while catering to old-school fans with a few carryovers from the original trilogy. It only gets better with each viewing."

594,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"Students of history will find plenty to carp about, which does slightly spoil the overall effect, but as a searing slice of entertainment Argo is hard to fault."

600,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"While Argo does have it's flaws, the film strives for overall authenticity."
601,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"Although the partially true story succumbs to some rather silly Hollywood tropes towards the end, ARGO does an engaging job of burnishing both sides of the Affleck coin."
602,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"You cannot call it a comedy, you cannot even call it a straight book-to-film adaptation - but you can call Argo so many other things: a satirical political thriller, gripping, tense...and fantastic."
603,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"A detailed, true story that has some trouble finding its footing between political thriller and suspense movie."
604,argo_2012,critics,rotten,n,The film plays out in the broadest of broad strokes with Affleck employing a lowest common denominator tone that would make the most hackneyed of Hollywood filmmakers proud.
605,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"As a director Affleck's impressive, expanding on the promise he showed in Gone Baby Gone and The Town. He's adopted a much lighter style for Argo, with a zippy curve-ball narrative spins from wit to suspense."
606,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,You've really got to hand it to Affleck.
607,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,Both a riveting spy thriller and an emotionally engaging piece of historical filmmaking.
608,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"This is a movie best seen with as little knowledge as possible, making the surprises (even the ones that are predictable) that much more entertaining."
609,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"It's a smart and hugely enjoyable action thriller as it is, with some wicked humor and a feel-good ending that's manipulative, sure, but was, in part, bequeathed to us by history."
610,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"For any audience, it is a thriller that provides constant rising tension and actual thrills."
611,argo_2012,critics,fresh,p,"Not only that Argo is both intelligent and entertaining, it's riveting from start to finish."
612,argo_2012,critics,rotten,n,"The action is exciting, the Hollywood scenes are dryly funny. But we never get to know the people for whom this farcical plot has been invented."
613,argo_2012,audience,4.0,p,"Enjoyable action and contains some tension, but it ultimately felt inaccurate and lacked character depth. The story was important to share and perfect for a film. Unfortunately, the characters were abandoned in terms of development in favour of focusing on the plot, and several events were clearly modified for the purposes of drama. On the other hand, the pacing wasn't too slow nor too fast, the acting was believable, the cinematography felt modern, the visual effects were decent, the sets/props/costumes seemed genuine enough, and the soundtrack was catchy and effective."
614,argo_2012,audience,4.5,p,"An edge of your seat movie with dark humor, it recreates the Iran Hostage crisis with incredible attention to detail and tremendous characters.  Ben Affleck does it again with direction as this felt more like a movie from an earlier era- less showy, frenetic and more focused on narrative.  The only knock is there are so many characters, it is hard to develop them all."
615,argo_2012,audience,4.0,p,"Argo ha senza dubbio una sceneggiatura di qualità; che probabilmente pecca di mancanza di azione per essere totalmente adatta al grande schermo.
Forse questo è l'unico punto debole del racconto; il bisogno hollywoodiano di inserire un finale al cardiopalma e denso di suspense, quando probabilmente sarebbe stato meglio attenersi alla storia vera visto il tipo di film.
Molto interessante la narrazione degli eventi che hanno portato a questa assurda missione; a cui giustamente viene data la priorità rispetto al racconto dei personaggi.
Peccato per una prima scena un po' troppo rapida, in cui non si capisce molto bene la sequenza degli eventi."
616,argo_2012,audience,3.0,p,"It might be true that it takes one day to learn to direct, but then it's true that an entire life is not enough to learn writing."
617,argo_2012,audience,5.0,p,Great Movie! Check out Persepolis!
618,argo_2012,audience,3.5,p,"Anxious, engaging, and interesting, but overall, Argo is a commonly played out political thriller."
619,argo_2012,audience,4.5,p,The beginning makes it impossible for me to root for the Americans.  There should be discussions about what happened back then.  I'm guessing there have been discussions and I missed them all.  Movies are important.
620,argo_2012,audience,5.0,p,An old school edge-of-the-seat thriller of the kind they don't seem to make any more. This reminded me what a pity that is.
621,argo_2012,audience,4.5,p,"It was an amazing and intense ride. The only thing I knew about Argo was that it won the Oscar for Best Picture, I didn't expected this incredible film."

626,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Lulu Wang's The Farewell is bittersweet in the truest sense of the word, balancing on the knife edge of grief and joy."
627,the_farewell_2019,critics,rotten,n,"The movie wants you to believe that there are no easy answers [...] But unfortunately, there are easy answers here, and The Farewell did not do a good enough job of convincing me that this lie was necessary or ethical."
628,the_farewell_2019,critics,fresh,p,"No matter where you come from, you'll likely find some point of connection with The Farewell. The film's themes of love and loss resonate far beyond its Chinese location, thanks to a talented cast and deft writing and directing."

651,the_farewell_2019,audience,3.5,p,It's worth a watch but a little overrated. It is great that Hollywood is making movies of diversity and different cultures. Some of the writing just feels a little forced.
652,the_farewell_2019,audience,5.0,p,"This family comedy drama, directed by Lulu Wang, features one of the most powerful and beautiful endings in the recent years, which is by itself enough for the recommendation. Add to this story a big family gathering, whose members are facing the possibility of losing their loving matriarch and you'll get a universally relatable picture, in this case painted in Chinese American colors. Central part of the movie belongs to the touching relationship between grandma and granddaughter, masterfully played by Shuzhen Zhao and Awkwafina."
653,azor,critics,fresh,p,A suspenseful drama about the woes of the wealthy during times of political uncertainties in Argentina.
654,azor,critics,fresh,p,A magnificent lesson on what should be seen on screen more often. [Full review in Spanish]
655,azor,critics,fresh,p,"Conceptually, Azor, is brilliant and its dreamlike editing that joins one meeting to the next with little connective tissue is often intriguing. But as a viewing experience, it is roundly obtuse with a repetitious, meandering narrative."
656,azor,critics,fresh,p,"Restraint and alarm are the film's keynotes, with a hint of wry black comedy in every exchange."
657,azor,critics,fresh,p,"""Azor"" is a film of impeccably polished facades capable of concealing horrors."
658,azor,critics,fresh,p,The feeling of uneasy dread grows throughout this memorable film: it is palpable but is never explained.
659,azor,critics,fresh,p,"Fontana's movie gives us a precise account of a society's codes of conduct - and a vague, disquieting sense of the corruption behind it all."
660,azor,critics,fresh,p,Fontana's sinewy debut teems with unseen threat. He crafts an atmosphere of grubbiness despite all the polished surfaces.
661,azor,critics,fresh,p,"It's a fine film, with a bleak message about how capitalism will thrive in just about any circumstance."
662,azor,critics,fresh,p,"As with the concealing language of the dictatorship, death is everywhere, just not on screen."
663,azor,critics,fresh,p,This superb debut feature from Andreas Fontana puts an ingenious spin on the paranoid thriller: its main character is determined to behave as if he isn't in one.
664,azor,critics,fresh,p,"Fontana models the surface of the film after Yvan: assertively calm. But the unease thrums, brilliantly evoked - as if in every scene, something nightmarish was always just out of shot. It is."
665,azor,critics,fresh,p,A genuinely mysterious journey into the heart of darkness.
666,azor,critics,fresh,p,An offbeat and ambitious work. One which largely succeeds in maintaining a tense and brooding undertone.
667,azor,critics,fresh,p,It is a film that continues to echo mysteriously inside my head.
668,azor,critics,fresh,p,"Azor is an intelligent, assured debut from Andreas Fontana, though its sober narrative translucency certainly won't be for everyone."
669,azor,critics,fresh,p,There's a compelling contrast between the comforting glow of this world and the consistent sense of threat that permeates the movie.
670,azor,critics,fresh,p,"The protagonist for this film may be an unassuming Swiss banker, but he would be at home in a novel by Graham Greene or John le Carré."
671,azor,critics,fresh,p,"Although it's hard to think of a story about a banker being a real white knuckler, Fontana turns Azor into just that."
672,azor,critics,fresh,p,The supporting actors are the true highlights here -- Ines with her ambition and calculating coldness; a boorish lawyer for the nouveau riche; and a particularly creepy and soft-spoken monsignor.
673,azor,audience,5.0,p,"Brilliant. Among other things, this is one of the best depictions of human evil that I've ever seen on screen. And yet, not a single shot is fired.

The film is set in Argentina in 1980. A right-wing military junta (backed, unfortunately, by the US) is in the process of kidnapping, torturing, and murdering thousands of civilians. But you wouldn't know it from this movie - except from anxious, oblique references - because the social class the film depicts is (almost) completely insulated from the violence that's done to protect their interests. Still, there's tension and dread beneath the surface, from start to finish."
674,azor,audience,1.5,n,"It's one of those typical movies that movie critics salivate over. The tension that all the reviews allude to comes from pointless dialogues and long silences and those long shots that's supposed to represent the character's loneliness and internal turmoil. For most part the dialogues are stiff and theatrical, it just feels like a play for most of the time, and a really pretensions and boring one. The main character looks like he has a constipation for the entire movie. This should have been a TV movie at best. The pretentious references to The Heart of Darkness like traveling down the river to meet the baddie is just that - pretentious references.

The only quality comes in the last 5 minutes but it doesn't justify the dreadful 85 minutes that supersede that.

It tries to be like Friedkin's Sorcerer (especially using that transistor music which in this movie really feels fake and forced) or Antonioni&#39;s The Passenger. It&#39;s neither and doesn't come even close. If you want to watch a good movie about that disappearances in Argentina at the time of the military junta watch Costa-Gavras' Missing with Jack Lemon. This is just a poor, student's tribute to 70's political drama.

I&#39;m giving it 3 stars because there are movies worse than this. I thought about giving it 1 just to correct the rating because this film is absolutely nowhere 10, 9 or even 8. Critics giving it 100/100 is just a joke..."
675,azor,audience,5.0,p,"If you have a soft spot for a classic build up with a vintage twist in the mold of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, you'll absolutely love this. One of the most exquisite thrillers in a while."
676,azor,audience,1.0,n,"Good lord, this was painful to sit through. I don't know what the critics were looking at.  The music/sound was jarring to the extent that sometimes I thought I was hearing noise from adjoining theaters bleeding into mine. The primary actors, I guess, were representing the emotional pulse of bankers, wives of bankers, friends of bankers, etc., but my God, that didn't warrant making me sit through two hours watching them.  I began to fidget throughout, as I kept waiting for something of interest to happen. Others will call it, ""... a quiet, unhurried, un-flashy film..."" or ""a real white knuckler."" I would call it just plain boring!!!"
677,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"The quintessential pre-Code rom-com, laying out the template for a formula that exists to this day."
678,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"It Happened One Night is a sparkling, amusing, clean and thoroughly delightful Columbia picture which this writer would enjoy seeing a second time."
679,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"It makes no difference where you see it, just so long as you see it. But if I were you, I'd see it now. And you've got to see it, for it's straight, genuine fun."
680,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"The co-stars are a refreshing team with their good looks, bonhomie, and talent."
681,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,It is my broad opinion as a motion picture fan that It Happened One Night is one of the most entertaining films that has ever been offered to the public.
682,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,There is a growing conviction in this corner that Mr. Frank Capra is by far Hollywood's most reliable director.
683,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,Their misadventures are so hilarious that audiences give themselves up to one long spasm of laughter from the first shot to the last but behind all the hilarity there is tenderness and sympathy.
684,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,The surprise in this film is the discovery of Clark Gable as a comedian of considerable charm and ability.
685,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"In case you've missed the point of all this, we enjoyed It Happened One Night tremendously. We can't, to be entirely honest, remember when we've had quite as good a time at a movie."
686,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"Gable plays the determined and resourceful newshound in his accustomed forthright manner, with a restraint that helps to make the story believable."
687,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"Clark Gable does possibly his best work to date and reveals more of a carefree comedy tendency than heretofore. The Colbert performance, too, is excellent."
688,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"The audience gets tired of waiting for what it knows to be inevitable. The redeeming features, however, are the bright and breezy performances by Gable and Miss Colbert."
689,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,It is the kind of light entertainment that audiences always like very much.
690,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,Claudette Colbert is a particularly happy foil for Gable. They ought to be teamed up again.
691,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"The film is handled by Director Frank Capra in light and easy manner, built on a series of amusing trivialities."
692,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,Director Frank Capra's masterful hand delicately and lavishly operates each scene. [Full review in Spanish]
693,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"[It Happened One Night] is a comedy-romance of much more than usual merit. Frank Capra, director, has taken a mediocre and rather hackneyed story, with trite situations. and made it into a grand bit of entertainment."
694,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"This picture has the pulse. With Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert ideally cast, and... Walter Connolly and Roscoe Karns helping things along, it is just about guaranteed to cure any fit of the blues, and maybe even a headache."
695,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"It is lively, amusing, rapid of situation and dialogue, varied as to setting, and performed by two able [stars]."
696,it_happened_one_night,critics,fresh,p,"The supporting cast is an excellent one with such names as Walter Connolly, Roscoe Karns, Alan Hale, Blanche Frederici and a score or so of others"

699,it_happened_one_night,audience,4.0,p,A solid noir romance. The performances are both outstanding and the ending is very satisfying.
700,it_happened_one_night,audience,5.0,p,"It Happened One Night is amazing, a classic that has aged but remains very current, Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert deliver both comedic and well-crafted performances."
701,it_happened_one_night,audience,5.0,p,"This may be but a wish-fulfillment farce, but well-crafted all the same. It is never dull, and the story keeps you off-balance so the viewer never can really be sure how things will turn out.

A spoiled daughter of a very rich father, tiring of his gilded cage, finally runs off to elope with a daredevil aviator, who is in New York. The father hires a slew of detectives to locate her, but she manages to get on a bus with a reporter who has heard about her situation and wants a big story to boost his career. With that purpose, he helps the daughter on her way to New York, but plenty of things go wrong along the way. And to make matters worse, the father decides to allow the marriage to take place-but complications ensue from that.

Great character interaction and acting not only between the two leads, but between each of them as well as side characters make the story exciting, and the atmosphere of a dull, irritating bus ride and later running through the countryside is perfectly conveyed. Arguably one of the greatest of Frank Capra's movies."
702,it_happened_one_night,audience,4.0,p,"Reviewed 7.26.21  To see this movie for the first time is to have it hit you: all romantic comedies started here.  Sure, Buster Keaton & Charlie Chaplin brilliantly touched on the genre via silent films in the 1920's.  But it wasn't until Robert Risken put pen to paper that this now ubiquitous genre was created.  If not for the cringeworthy way men communicated with women 'way back when,' the flow of the dialogue could have been lifted from a modern rom-com. 
 
It'll seem quaint to today's moviegoer.  Just to think that Claudette Colbert demanded a 'leg stunt double' be called in for the classic hitchhiking scene, before quipping ""that's not my leg,"" and relenting.  The film was pre-code too, but nonetheless, the prudish surface of things pervades.  It's all the funnier for it.  

Add Clark Gable at his still youthful and quirky best, and there's charm to spare.  Without context, one might dismiss it as simple, even frivolous (as many still do today when critiquing the genre).  But alas, it was revolutionary, becoming the first film to win all five major Academy awards. 
 
Sure it has blemishes, the flow is broken at times by odd sing-alongs and quirky asides, but that's kind of the beauty of it.  Romantic comedies still aren't considered high art, so it's the perfect blueprint for the genre it created.  Alone in a vacuum, it's a 3 star movie.  But as it sinks in that you're watching a must-see piece of film history, and a true first, it's 4 stars all the way."
703,it_happened_one_night,audience,3.5,p,"This type of movie is not normally my cup of tea.  Watching it with no context, it is a rather dated lightweight rom com that managed to win best picture at the 1934 Oscars, though few of the best picture winners from the era have aged well.  My opinion of the film improved actually by watching the special features (the main reason I bother with DVDs anymore), particularly the commentary from Frank Capra Jr.  He tells a story of a picture that was not considered to be much of anything by its lead actress, who insisted she had to go on vacation in four weeks and the film simply had to be done in that timeframe.  The result of this hectic and frenetic shooting schedule was a film that FEELS frenetic in terms of its pacing, and it took someone pointing this out to me to see what an amazing, seat-of-your-pants thing it was that the film got made at all, let alone to the great acclaim it received from audiences and critics.  This certainly deepened my respect for if not my enjoyment of this film.  It's got some really funny sequences and is worth the watch!"
704,it_happened_one_night,audience,4.0,p,"This was an enjoyable watch and the movie was clearly well-crafted, made particularly obvious by how tons of rom-coms have drawn inspiration from it. I had actually never seen Clark Gable in a movie before and found myself surprised at how slight and skinny he seemed. Most of the comedy has withstood the passing of time, though like most rom-coms they don't lean into it heavily enough to make the movie as funny as it could've been. Until this movie I'd been very surprised that I liked all the Capra movies I'd seen as he was a conservative with values that aren't held by anyone but the villains in some of his movies; this one was the first I'd seen where Robert Riskin was the screenwriter and it made much more sense after that as Robert (a  big liberal) apparently wrote Frank's earliest successes and Frank repeated them later. Of particular note to me was how much better this movie was than the Best Picture winner from the year prior as that was one of my least-favorite movies of all time; this one being extremely good cements my opinion that Cavalcade just sucked and that it wasn't representative of this era of movies. Woohoo!"
705,it_happened_one_night,audience,5.0,p,"I felt like I was watching the mother of the films. This movie has been so influential to cinema is impossible to not like it. Is so full of details and charming performances, comedy and chemistry between its actors. Definetly, a story that remains in the heart."
706,it_happened_one_night,audience,5.0,p,"Beautiful classic, the kind of movie that only happens once."
707,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,Extraordinary. [Full review in Spanish]
708,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Director Florian Zeller makes light work of this adaption of his play, using the camera to recreate the claustrophobia and uncertainty of relying on an uncertain mind."
709,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Anthony Hopkins is one of the best actors alive right now, undoubtedly. The Father was one of the best surprises of 2020, with an incredible visual concept that blows my mind when I think this is Zeller's first film. [Full review in Spanish]"
710,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"[Much] of the strength of the film lies in Anthony Hopkins' lead performance alongside Olivia Colman, Zeller's direction is nothing to sniff at."
711,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,It's a film that's worth more for its conception and execution than its ideological discourse or social agenda. [Full review in Spanish]
712,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Memory is not linear, and 'The Father' captures what it must feel like when memories stop connecting. Anthony Hopkins gives one of his great performances."
713,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,The film seamlessly blends genuine fear with overwhelming sadness.
714,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Hopkins...has never been better. And, given his much garlanded career, that really is saying something."
715,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Watching The Father feels like watching a particularly good episode of Black Mirror, without any of the tech paranoia."
716,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"A forensic examination, powerfully written and delivered with brio, of the impact of dementia on a retired engineer and those closest to him"
717,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"The word ""devastating"" is used so much as to be almost devalued. But, in its truest, most powerful sense, The Father is devastating."
718,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"There is no gawdy tricks, nor leaning on tropes. From start to finish The Father is exactly what you see it as. Confusing, scary, loving, and sad."
719,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"It has an exceptional script, and not only because of the dialogues' quality, but because it plays with what the viewer sees and understands. [Full review in Spanish]"
720,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"[Anthony Hopkins] is absolutely remarkable here. I read the screenplay, available online, out of curiosity, and what he brings to the words on the page is beyond and beyond and beyond. Hopkins has played King Lear (twice) but this is his real King Lear."
721,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"The way Zeller and his production designer Peter Francis orchestrate these changes are almost imperceptible, but nevertheless disorienting and utterly crucial to the narrative."
722,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,Watching two great performers together provides The Father's highpoint.
723,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Without resorting to exploitative, amped-up mystery or obfuscation, Zeller and co-writer Christopher Hampton have fashioned a sort of gaslight thriller in which the mind is both predator and prey."
724,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Zeller has delivered not only the best film adaptation of the season, but one of the most effective, moving and, dare I say, cinematic films of the year."
725,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,Yet The Father is a powerful debut. The mood of isolation with its warped sense of time and the distanced characters confined to their homes: this film reflects our present moment without labouring the point home or making the obvious analogies.
726,the_father_2021,critics,fresh,p,"This is a film of immeasurable power which everyone should experience once. It explores the frailties of being human, in a society which increasingly values youth over experience."
727,the_father_2021,audience,4.0,p,"A stellar acting from Anthony Hopkins and Olivier Coleman. The movie is in the perspective of the lead character ‘Anthony’ who is suffering from dementia. The main actor (Hopkins) perfectly depicts what a person goes through/feels when they are subjected to dementia. While watching the movie, viewers would also have hard time separating the reality (present) and memories (past) of Anthony as he mixes both of them up."
728,the_father_2021,audience,4.0,p,"A good movie, but the other one with Viggo Mortenson is more gritty and real - Falling"
729,the_father_2021,audience,4.5,p,"Hopkins has never been better than this, playing a fragile man fallen apart though dementia, The Father is a devastating look at what people go though entirely alone, even if they have people around them."
730,the_father_2021,audience,5.0,p,"Honestly one of the greatest movies I've seen. You experience what someone with Alzheimer's goes through on a daily basis. The cast was spectacular, Anthony Hopkins gives an amazing performance throughout the film you feel as if he actually has the disease. Truly a great film and does its job at spreading awareness."
731,the_father_2021,audience,5.0,p,Visually stunning. Clean work right here.
732,the_father_2021,audience,2.5,n,"An accurate yet depressing look at life as one gets old and loses touch with reality. Troubling look at the beauty of family commitment and the toll it takes on the loved ones. Not sure it is worth watching, unless you like sadness and emotional pain."
733,the_father_2021,audience,5.0,p,Fabulously sad. I almost walked out with PTSD - my Dad went through this with his own father - the parallels were scary!
734,the_father_2021,audience,2.0,n,"Talk about a true head spin, the setup felt like it should be there, but the camera work, and the circling dialogue, just put your head in a blender and hit the extreme button on the end of the machine."
735,the_father_2021,audience,5.0,p,Immersive and heartbreaking to say the least.
736,the_father_2021,audience,4.0,p,I appreciated being able to simultaneously empathize with and consider the perspective of both leads.
737,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,Takes courage to make your first film. But to make it around the conversation of four giants and pulling it off is on another level of guts. Regina King's directorial debut causes intrigue into knowing more about these men. [Full review in Spanish]
738,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,A good hang-out movie that invokes the stage more than the cinema.
739,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"With these guys out in front and King behind the camera, Miami is quite the appealing actors' show. King and her performers capture a fascinating moment in African-American history."
740,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"With fine acting, clear direction and perceptive relevance, One Night in Miami transforms from a strong play into powerful cinema."
741,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"There is so much beauty seeing our people depicted onscreen without the focus being on trauma, but a way through."
742,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"In such politically troubled times, where it seems that any political disagreement creates an unbreachable interpersonal rift, One Night in Miami shows the beauty of productive disagreement and dissent."
743,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"In the end, there's an underlying reason why there has been nothing but praise for Regina King and One Night in Miami."
744,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"As Cooke, Ali, and Brown, Leslie Odom Jr., Eli Goree, and Aldis Hodge are all in the pocket. It's Hodge, though, who brings the most to his character while still recognizably playing Jim Brown."
745,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,Brotherhood and Race Drive the Beautifully Executed 'One Night in Miami'
746,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"An electrifying philosophical fantasia that imagines four towering figures of 1960s America arguing over how to navigate racism as Black men. Enraging, but also thrilling, bursting with cinematic joy."
747,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"What a sure hand Regina King showed in her directorial debut! It's a solid and proven screenplay, yes, but to block and shoot a chamber piece like this requires a lot else."
748,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,Delivers a timely message on the interplay between celebrity and advocacy during turbulent times.
749,one_night_in_miami,critics,rotten,n,"There's no sense of the spiritual and theological foundations of black American survival. Instead, One Night in Miami establishes a cult of celebrity activism, with Malcolm as its deity."
750,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,What if...?
751,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,This is a must-watch film for anyone who needs to learn why Black Lives Matter.
752,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"A whip-smart, well-appointed period drama built around a terrific cast, crackling dialogue and an undeniably inspired premise."
753,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"Reminiscent of Nicolas Roeg's 1985 film Insignificance, which imagined a fictional hotel room meeting between Marilyn Monroe, Albert Einstein, Joe DiMaggio, and Joseph McCarthy."
754,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,A fictional recreation of a gathering of four Black leaders and their sometimes heated conversation about their goals and aspirations.
755,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"Usually, with these kind of films, people get caught up in the historical accuracy...here, they move and shift events around, but really, it embraces the spirit of the time and the characters. Can't speak highly enough for it."
756,one_night_in_miami,critics,fresh,p,"A film not only of exceptional power and feeling, but of abundant texture and detail as well."
757,one_night_in_miami,audience,4.0,p,A great story of the struggle to be a public figure. But at times it felt like the movie was dragging on.
758,one_night_in_miami,audience,4.0,p,"Wondered what all the awards were about and now I see.  Great people making a difference in racial equality in their own unique way.  Singing was great, too!"
759,one_night_in_miami,audience,5.0,p,"Electrifying performances from the four leads make this stage adapted, the directorial debut from Regina King never let up. It maintains just enough stage feel to remind the audience where it came from without being too distracting. Its message and dialogue, unfortunately, ring true even today. Ms. King knows her way around behind the camera and I look forward to her next endeavor."
760,one_night_in_miami,audience,1.5,n,This is long and boring.  I learned some things.  But essentially this is a two hour discussion of racism.  It lacked a lot in terms of entertainment.
761,one_night_in_miami,audience,3.5,p,So good. The actors are all incredible and play off each other well.
762,one_night_in_miami,audience,3.0,p,"I had a lot of trouble getting past the part where all of the guys are in the hotel room because Malcolm invited them there under super-false pretenses so that he could railroad them into a sales pitch for his religion. All of the actors did an excellent job with their roles and Odom's singing parts were the highlight of the movie for me, but about 60% of the way through I realized they had wanted me to forgive or forget that Malcolm had not only basically lied to get them all there but then forced them to stay in the room while he took a leisurely stroll to the payphone to have a lengthy conversation with his daughter & to bring a camera back to show them that nobody had any interest in. I think I could've moved on had this been a true story, but since it wasn't it means that someone wrote as a character trait for Malcolm that he was incredibly casual with other people's time, a trait that I doubt he really had. The posturing from the bodyguards wasn't interesting either, but at the end of the day 90% of the movie was watching historical figures interact with each other, and it would've taken more problems than this to have made that an unenjoyable viewing experience."
763,one_night_in_miami,audience,5.0,p,One of the best movies I've ever seen.
764,one_night_in_miami,audience,4.5,p,"Mostly conversation, but great dialogue from interesting characters."
765,one_night_in_miami,audience,1.5,n,"Two words: nothing happens. The plot was nearly as simple as it gets, with most of the film taking place in one hotel room. There were about eight different sets in the entire film - the house at the beginning, the boxing ring, the swimming pool, the hotel room, Malcolm X's house, the hotel roof, the diner, and the TV show at the end. Then the real ending was just some white text on a black background, which felt like a complete cop-out. There was a little bit of suspense when Malcolm X was being followed, but then they didn't do anything, which demonstrated that nothing exciting was going to happen for the rest of the film either. Malcom X's house was on fire for a really short scene, but Malcolm X didn't know how to handle a gun and only his family was shown on screen, again meaning no actual action. As for the dialogue, there was too much of it, and all of it was fictional. The film was just a rambling discussion about being black vs being white, which meant poor pacing. The message has been discussed many times before and felt timed with the current political climate more than anything. The acting was well done but fake at the same time. The characters somewhat lacked depth and came across as rather one dimensional because the dialogue was repetitive. For instance, Muhammad Ali spent the entire film repeating derivatives of 'I am the greatest'. They also weren't given proper introductions, so if you've never heard of them before, you'll be completely lost. However, the cinematography was decent, the visual effects were fine, the sets/props/costumes looked the part, and the soundtrack was all right, although the singing seemed rather edited. Overall, the film could have been so much more than four actors walking around a room arguing about races and discrimination."
766,one_night_in_miami,audience,3.5,p,"Although obviously based on a one-room stage play, the director skillfully stages this adaptation with imaginative camerawork and several flashback scenes; moreover, the four main actors manage to present their interactions with drama, suspense and humor."
767,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,"Irishman represents, with its somber and mournful mood, what may be Scorsese's farewell to the sort of gangster tales that largely made his reputation."
768,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,A wonderful three and a half hours... a very human story.
769,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,"The Irishman is grand and ambitious, asking unanswerable questions about legacy, sorrow, and death."
770,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,A magnificently made film about the boredom of thug life.
771,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,"The director's 26th feature film is a meditative and classy offering. Hollywood's old cronies are still the real deal - magnetic, riveting and unique. Let's hope we see them again soon."
772,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,"While cinema is not to be restrained by reality, it is the double standard with which this film is judged that kept it at number 2 for me. Also, Joe Pesci makes it clear he is a national treasure."
773,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,The Irishman is a rare gem - it's everything you hoped it would be in a world where hype often manages to dampen even excellent films.
774,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,"The Irishman is not only one of Martin Scorsese's best films (which is saying a lot), but also a tribute to all the crime movies in which its director has specialized (contributing masterpieces to this genre). [Full review in Spanish]"
775,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,"While perhaps a step below Scorsese's other classic films, mostly because of its length, The Irishman shows that the master filmmaker still knows how to deliver a crackerjack story."
776,the_irishman,critics,rotten,n,Scorsese has never been drawn to presenting actual history. ... The director has done little to add to the public's knowledge about Jimmy Hoffa or the degeneration of the American labor movement.
777,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,"The holy trinity, De Niro, Pesci and Pacino, hand in late career work that feels like the culmination of a lifetime of character studies."
778,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,The Irishman looks inwards and acts as a sorrowful dismantling of one's own myth-making.
779,the_irishman,critics,rotten,n,"Here is the most unpopular opinion of the year: The Irishman is too long, too contrived and, generally, too much Martin Scorsese trying to outdo himself."
780,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,"In a very real sense, Martin Scorsese is fighting against his own mythic legacy. In another way, of course, his return to the form in which he made some of the more compelling American cinema of the last five decades is a perfectly fitting closing coda."
781,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,"Scorsese makes movies that Scorsese likes, damned be anyone who doesn't care much for them. All of his stylistic touches are here, but there's a certain hollowness to the whole affair that's admirable even if not likeable."
782,the_irishman,critics,rotten,n,Little more than an excuse to get the band back together.
783,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,"Perhaps Martin Scorsese's most ambitious work, this biopic of reputed union leader and mob hitman Frank Sheeran (DeNiro) has a narrative sweep that immediately grabs the viewer and refuses to let them go."
784,the_irishman,critics,rotten,n,"Well, objectively, the film is kind of boring."
785,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,"I saw The Irishman in a huge theater on a giant screen, and I did not want to get up, didn't want it to end, and could have watched another hour of it if there was one."
786,the_irishman,critics,fresh,p,A film that seems like typical Scorsese until it doesn't seem like typical Scorsese anymore.
787,the_irishman,audience,3.0,p,An interesting story about true people and events. Story could be very bland at times and frustrating to follow with all time time jumping.
788,the_irishman,audience,3.5,p,"nice try, with the (little spooky) digitalized faces....unfortunately, odd-looking, on the 75yr+ bodies..
and, apparently Jimmy Hoffa spent A LOT of time in his dressing gown & PJs
Gotta love all those wise guys though!"
789,the_irishman,audience,4.0,p,"A great movie BUT it resembles a lot to other mafia movies, and it is as long as they are. In other words, I believe that you will have very much the same experience if you watch Casino in which again you will see very big performances from De Niro and Pesci. One remarkable thing about this movie is that it is one of the first big productions presented in a streaming platform."
790,the_irishman,audience,3.5,p,"It's fun to watch De Niro inhabit this character, and it's his particular combination of tough guy who has frightened everyone around him and just-following-orders hangdog  enforcer that is memorable about this. Nevertheless, I couldn't escape the feeling that I had seen De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci in overall more gripping gangster movies, back when they didn't have to be digitally de-aged for most of the movie."
791,the_irishman,audience,4.5,p,"The movie is clever and entertaining and moves gently along where, in the last half hour, it moves you in a very deep way.  The de-aging of the characters are distracting at first but then settles in very realistically. 

At times it felt like an amalgamation of Scorcese's entire career.  Likely his best crime movie since Goodfellas.  The acting of Pesci, DeNiro, and Pacino are second to. none."
792,the_irishman,audience,5.0,p,Brilliant movie! I was hesitant at first but this is genius.
793,the_irishman,audience,4.0,p,Just overall an excellent movie.
794,the_irishman,audience,2.5,n,I'm a big fan of Scorsese's work but this one just didn't have the old magic.  Not a bad  way to spend a couple of hours but don't expect Goodfellas.
795,the_irishman,audience,4.5,p,This movie utilizes a powerhouse of a cast to portray one of the greatest Pennsylvania crime stories ever told. Robert De Niro doesn't miss a beat portraying a war veteran Irishman who begins to work for one of the biggest Italian crime families the Bufalinos. Martin Scorsese never ceases to amaze me with the detail of his films. And to include massive portions of American history alongside a perfect tour of mob crime life is truly remarkable.
796,the_irishman,audience,4.5,p,"Great movie but both Michael Franzese and Sammy The Bull don't believe the ending is legit. 

Totally worth your time but it's fiction; not a documentary."
797,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,"Spearheaded by a dynamite lead performance, this story of recovery and, more so, denial, reaches and aching honesty."
798,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,"The final act's quietly played emotional turmoil - in which Cooke really gets to spread her wings - is a triumph, building to an elegant and heart-warming finale."
799,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,"As inconsistent and inherently dubious as this aural gambit may be, it achieves a kind of blunt-force effectiveness in tandem with the earnest, wild-eyed performance by Ahmed."

804,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,"An elegy to punk rock, to deafness, and to the peace that can be found when we embrace life's quietest moments -the silence within ourselves."
805,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,"Sound of Metal is an astonishing accomplishment for both its long-nascent director and its British star, Riz Ahmed, for whom his turn as heavy metal drummer Ruben represents a career-best performance."
806,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,"It's a tour-de-force that requires real concentration to appreciate, the sort of concentration you'll find only in the cinema."
807,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,"What sets this apart from other films in the ""bloke sobs in the bathtub, then punches a hole in the wall"" personal anguish genre is how the deaf community is depicted."
808,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,"Sound of Metal never does anything particularly unexpected or intricate with its storyline, but the technical aspects of its filmmaking - from the editing to the sound profile to the acting - are always impressive."
809,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,Putting us in Ruben's head strengthens the theme of loss of identity... and makes the character's hardships hit harder than a drummer on a snare.

811,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,"Riz Ahmed is the voice, eyes, and soul of Sound of Metal. Words simply can't convey what his vacant looks can."
812,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,...a predominantly successful effort that confirms Ahmed's place as one of his generation's most promising up-and-coming actors.
813,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,"A triumph in acting and sound design, with the former featuring Riz Ahmed's career-best performance as Ruben Stone."
814,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,"While the plot stumbles with an unevenly paced final act, Sound of Metal is nevertheless an astoundingly affective and emotionally resonating character piece that shines an inspirational light on the Deaf community"
815,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,Ahmed pours himself into his role as a drummer rapidly losing his hearing and turns a pretty good movie into something close to great with a punishing performance...
816,sound_of_metal,critics,fresh,p,This is a film that fuses the farthest limits of its form to tell its story and remind viewers of both the fragility and adaptability of life.
817,sound_of_metal,audience,4.5,p,Fascinating journey as the main character  comes to terms with his loss of hearing and gains insight into an alternative way of viewing the world.
818,sound_of_metal,audience,3.5,p,A realistic drama film about accepting deafness and drug addiction. Sound editing and the acting of Riz Ahmed (as Ruben) and Paul Raci (as Joe) is remarkable. The film’s title could also be a innuendo to the distorted sound from cochlear implant that led Ruben to accept deafness instead of fixing it.
819,sound_of_metal,audience,5.0,p,"While there haven't been many (and I still have a few more to view), Sound of Metal is likely my #2 movie of 2020, only slightly behind Da 5 Bloods. Unsurprisingly, Riz Ahmed as our protag, Ruben Stone, is incredible and, again, #2 performance of the year only behind Delroy Lindo in Da 5 Bloods — Elisabeth Moss is also up there for her performance in The Invisible Man. What is surprising is that Darius Marder made his directorial debut with this thought-provoking, touching, and entertaining film. Stone is ½ of the punk-rock duo, Blackgammon, the other half being his girlfriend, Lou (Olivia Cooke). Ruben — with the punk adage ""Please Kill Me"" tattooed across his chest — is a drummer who suddenly loses 90–99% of his hearing. If this wasn't enough, Ruben is a recovering addict, 4 years without using, and therefore needs — to his chagrin — not only a deaf-living house but sober-living, too. Marder uses sound in a way I've never experienced before — maybe because it's never been done(?) — to portray Ruben's disability. There was a moment when I thought the entire movie might've been conducted in this manner, which would've made a powerful point, but definitely would've been difficult to complete, but instead switches between regular hearing and the hearing-impaired. The direction and acting also beautifully showcases the frustrations of not being able to communicate. If there's one shot to stick with you, it's when all of the deaf school-children are resting on the grand-piano, Ruben right there with them. This movie is still new, so I'll spare more details, but the last three scenes, upon reflection, is one of the best sequences I've had the pleasure of viewing for a long time. There weren't many must-watches from 2020, but this is absolutely one of them."
820,sound_of_metal,audience,4.0,p,"Darius Marder's true debut and it's an interesting film. I thought for a long time that this was a documentary when I first got to know it. It sure has that look at times, but it's a bit deeper and has a few tailor made touches I guess. Ruben is a drummer in a metal band. He is an ex heroinist and lives with his girl and band member in his RV. They do gigs, but are never a big band. When he suddenly loses his hearing things naturally change. His career is no longer something to chase and he does not have much else. He gets into some sort of home. Kids and grown ups. Some earlier addicts, all of them are hearing impaired. He hats it at first, but likes it after a while. He still want's his surgery to make him hear again, but that's very expensive. His girl is someplace else and for some reason cell phones are prohibited from the home he stays as so there is not much contact between the two. 

Things are constantly happening here, mostly into something better. It has great sound, it looks good and it has a very great pace. It's never flat - but rarely big or really hitting you hard. A good film that could have been even better, but again, it could easily have been way worse too.

8 out of 10 drumkits."
821,sound_of_metal,audience,2.5,n,"Been meaning to watch this for a while.  Eh. It's gutsy making a movie with most of cast being deaf. Makes it hard for it to be captivating though. The performances were great, some of the direction and editing were decent, but overall the movie is kind of a bummer and not in a cool, thought provoking way. Kind of Oscar bait."
822,sound_of_metal,audience,5.0,p,"This is a film about the main character's struggle to adjust to losing his hearing, and about the community that helps him to adjust. It's an empathetic take on becoming deaf. The film says so much, despite the dialogue being sparse, and it shows the how peaceful, but at the same time lively, being deaf can be through a deft use of audio and visual techniques. It is full of engaging sensory experiences even though it is a film about the experience of losing a major sensory input. Excellent performance from Riz Ahmed and supporting cast, especially Paul Raci."
823,sound_of_metal,audience,4.0,p,81%. Very good movie. Interesting to see the perspective of deaf people like the sound of them all interacting via sign language at dinner. He goes to a home with other deaf adults and spends a lot of time with deaf kids. He's doing well but decides to sell his rv and music equipment for the surgery. He tells the head of the house and he tells him he broke his trust because everyone there doesn't see being deaf as a handicap or something that needs fixing. Would rewatch but not super worth it
824,sound_of_metal,audience,5.0,p,"Love the use of the sounds, definitely helps you immerse yourself in what Reuben is experiencing."
825,sound_of_metal,audience,5.0,p,"Sound Of Metal is a beautiful film about recognising and normalising one's differences. Although Darius Marder raises awareness for the deaf community, his sensitive message and emotional tale of self-discovery is universal. Although I never developed any hearing issues, I was diagnosed with a life-changing health condition at an early age. Ruben's loss of identity, isolation, and new lifestyle resonated on a personal level. Ultimately, Marder highlights what it means to be alive and to appreciate the unsung beauty of silence. Anchored by Riz Ahmed's incredible performance and heightened by the innovative sound design, Sound of Metal is a rewarding viewing experience."

Once again Pixar displays their ability to tell a great story without using a word. Post that eleven and a half minute mark the film doesn't live up to that opening, it isn't bad, just not as great. The voice acting is well done, but no real standouts. The animation from Pixar is again terrific. This film succeeds in invoking a sense of awe, adventure, comedy and in the end will warm your heart. Highly recommended movie, go check it out!"
852,up,audience,4.0,p,One of the few times I've been in a movie theater where it went totally silent. That beginning montage starts so happy and ends so heartbreaking all with the same tune just slowly morphing into a slower more somber version was brilliant. All you could hear in that silence of the theater was sniffling. A wonderful heartwarming tale of the grouchy old man and the enthusiastic young kid meshed so well together. The only thing I didn't like was that it kind of dragged in the middle.
853,up,audience,4.0,p,"A movie that a lot of people hold it on high regards but I have never had that feeling. Yes, the opening scene is phenomenal and the humor is good and emotions are flourished  like any other Pixar film but I kind off disconnected with it sometimes but that's just my personal opinion."

881,finding_nemo,audience,5.0,p,"A classic Disney movie that is worth the watch. This movie is child friendly with slight hidden adult humor. Finding Nemo focuses on a lost son with an overprotective single father. It shows that having helicopter parents can lead to defiant kids. The is a must see for parents and children with a take home message to not be defiant and not to have over protective parents. Not only is the movie sentimental and emotion, it is funny and will have you quoting the film for the rest of the week."
882,finding_nemo,audience,4.0,p,"A young clownfish named Nemo is taken by humans and his father, Marlin, transferces the ocean to find him, with a little help from a regal blue tang named Dory. This is a great film! The first two scenes do a great job to endear you to both Marlin and Nemo. Dory is instantly likable and relatable. As Marlin goes on his journey and develops his character, the characters he meets are all memorable and iconic. The aquarium crew are all memorable as well. The animation is top notch and really captures the underwater environment in a believable way. Ellen DeGeneres stands out in the voice acting department, by creating a unique and memorable character in Dory. One of the best films Pixar has done, highly recommended!"

900,2001_a_space_odyssey,critics,fresh,p,"Stanley Kubrick's whirligig vision of past and present, inner and outer space, is an overwhelming space opera of visual dance and prophetic trance."
901,2001_a_space_odyssey,critics,fresh,p,Thekey to unlocking the humour and understanding Kubrick's intentions can be found in the director's previous film.
902,2001_a_space_odyssey,critics,fresh,p,"A film of such symbolic and visceral power as ""2001"" invites various interpretations, like a prism you can turn at different angles, each revealing a new facet."
903,2001_a_space_odyssey,critics,fresh,p,Watching 2001 on the 50th anniversary of its release brings about feelings of both wonder and disappointment.
904,2001_a_space_odyssey,critics,fresh,p,Among the most important and iconic pictures ever produced... [it] continues to amaze and inspire.
905,2001_a_space_odyssey,critics,fresh,p,Director Stanley Kubrick's amazing marriage of music and images - seen at its absolute best in the space ballet of the capsule docking to the strains of Strauss' Blue Danube waltz - points to what we can achieve as a species when we put our minds to it.
906,2001_a_space_odyssey,critics,fresh,p,"It's a profound statement on humanity. It is one of the greatest films ever made, and it is one that should be seen in theaters to truly appreciate its greatness."
907,2001_a_space_odyssey,audience,5.0,p,It's influence on cinema and filmmaking is immeasurable.
908,2001_a_space_odyssey,audience,4.0,p,"One of the truly great movies of the 20th century.  The images, music, sparse dialogue.  The man vs. machine conflict.  To watch this movie in the 21st century is to marvel at the difference between when it was made and where space technology is our time.  What was science fiction then is science reality today.  A must see."
909,2001_a_space_odyssey,audience,4.5,p,A perfect work of art - a thinkers Star Wars.
910,2001_a_space_odyssey,audience,5.0,p,"Just a random guy named Stanley Kubrick showing off his filmmaking skills for 2 hours and 30 minutes straight.
All i can say is that i am as astounished as confused, and confused in the best way possible.
How was this made fucking 50 years ago and yet feels so ahead of its time? Cinematography and special effects that could perfectly fit a modern Sci-fi movie, a magestic score that even when the screen is all black it immerses you completely, and brilliant direction by non-other than Stanley.
Evolution is fucked up and Kubrick showed that in an amazing way.
I will definitely see this again some years from now."
911,2001_a_space_odyssey,audience,5.0,p,Amazing.  Seen it 10 times and never bores
912,2001_a_space_odyssey,audience,5.0,p,Astoundingly ahead of its time and extremely well executed.  Slow burn worth it
913,2001_a_space_odyssey,audience,5.0,p,"Abstract High Art in a Mainstream American [British] Film
If you can't handle semi abstract art or a slowly paced movie, stay away.  If you like to use your brain and want to see one of the most ground breaking beautifully photographed movies ever made, this is for you."
914,2001_a_space_odyssey,audience,3.5,p,"Kubrick captured some of the best shots in cinematic history. That said, as amazing as his cinematography skills may have been; his ability to tell a story and direct were horrific. This could have been the perfect movie if turned over to an editor who knew how to shape a story."
915,2001_a_space_odyssey,audience,2.0,n,"My attention span could not handle the instrumental dramatic themes of this movie. Others consider this a masterpiece, I on the other hand was simply bored."
916,2001_a_space_odyssey,audience,4.0,p,"Okay I get that this is supposed to be one of the best movies ever made, but I think I saw this movie for the first time after seeing references to it - so much so that it detracts from the viewing experience of the source material. Stop great. Still impressive. Just doesn't have that magic."
917,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,"We are terrified by the idea that, as Fern, we might have an incredibly frail appearance of stability. What would we do if life doesn't turn out the way we wanted it to? Nomadland provided the freedom we wanted in 2020. [Full review in Spanish]"
918,nomadland,critics,rotten,n,Beautiful cinematography in an alienating film doesn't have much value... [Nomadland] ends up idealizing an unideal situation. [Full review in Spanish]
919,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,"Featuring one of McDormand's best performances - a role she occupies deeply - and emotionally dissecting the economic terrors of backwater America, 'Nomadland' is one of the best of the year."
920,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,This warmth and genuine appreciation of people and the many routes they take make Nomadland one of the best movies in Nevada's supply of road pictures.
921,nomadland,critics,rotten,n,"It ultimately reverts to homilies, offering a flinty, exciting character a bland third-act volte-face."
922,nomadland,critics,rotten,n,"Nomadland the movie gets lost in its own drift, and, simply, drops off the map."
923,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,"It could well be that [Zhao's] liminal identity, an insider-outsider multiplicity, has equipped her with a unique point of view as a filmmaker."
924,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,"Somber but never dismal, personal and yet enormous."
925,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,"Nomadland is a film with a sensibility, a power and a security in its resources and searches that make an impact. [Full Review in Spanish]"
926,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,"Trekking across middle America with an optimistic glint in her eye, Frances McDormand's Fern could come straight from a Springsteen tune..."
927,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,"A highly recommended road-movie where the melodrama is supported with steel nails, avoiding any kind of easy solution and proudly raising the gaze of those who lost everything. [Full Review in Spanish]"
928,nomadland,critics,rotten,n,"But with its clumsy dramatic embellishments ... and kitschy, faux-lyrical interludes ... [the film] is a reminder that ambivalence is not at all the same thing as complexity."
929,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,"In McDormand's marvellous incarnation [Fern] is difficult to understand, tight, untalkative, but also helpful to others, and given to smiling occasionally in ways that contradict her dryness."
930,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,It is one of the best films so far about the impact of the recession because of the human angle it takes.
931,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,Chloe Zhao's Nomadland mimics life scrupulously...
932,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,"For while, essentially, this is the bleak story of Fern... it is Richards's horizon-spanning photography that reminds us that what we're actually watching is a modern-day western."
933,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,McDormand produced the film too - her performance really is extraordinary.
934,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,People will keep coming back to this film for years to come because its messages and themes are timeless.
935,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,"Zhao digs up something fierce, a little sad, spurred on by a lovely sense of longing and belonging that could be the perfect palate-cleanser after the year we've all just had. Frankly, the open road never looked better."
936,nomadland,critics,fresh,p,"Wander with beautiful, mournful 'Nomadland.'"
937,nomadland,audience,4.5,p,"That's a powerful concept, ""home"". Fern (Frances McDormand) even corrects the idea that she isn't homeless, but ""houseless"". You see, Fern is a nomad who travels the American West and Great Plains, taking part-time jobs here and there and meeting other nomads here and there. Fern doesn't do this in a way to discover herself (à la Wild) or because she has become disenchanted with contemporary society (à la Into the Wild), Fern does this out of necessity. She loved her home when it was a house, located at the edge of a company town in Northwest Nevada, where she lived with her beloved husband and remained after he passed away. The mineral plant closed and town with it — the zip code was deactivated shortly thereafter. Zhao shoots this film like a documentary. It's subtle, nothing is forced. Like Fern and her nomadic lifestyle, the plot never really goes where you expect it to — beginning with the dog. I was expecting to encounter nomads who were ""houseless"" for the more perceived reasons — drug abuse, mental illness, evading the law — but we get nothing of the sort. In fact, Fern wants to work, she ""likes work,"" but work is scarce. It's deeply American with ""salt of the Earth"" feelings throughout. It feels authentic because it is authentic; except for McDormand and David Straitharn, who plays a love-interest (but remember what I noted about this meandering plot), most of the characters are themselves nomads. God, I loved Swankie (Swankie). Her little rehash of her life, why she's accepted her fate, is one of the most moving couple of minutes I've seen in a while. I'm not much of a crier, but this brought me damn close — the beginning is cut btw. (How is she not an actress?!) I also thought Fern was going to follow Swankie, I wanted Fern to follow Swankie, but that's not what we get, and that's okay. I appreciated this movie the more I let it settle in. I like movies that do that. I don't think it'd be my 2021 Best Picture, but I'd be happy if it won. Watch it."
938,nomadland,audience,4.5,p,Went and seen this film randomly through the week with no expectations having not even heard of it. Presently surpired and enjoyed the touching story of this journey through life.
939,nomadland,audience,4.0,p,Predictable but fun film.
940,nomadland,audience,1.0,n,It seemed more like a freshmen college theater project. I had to fast forward through a lot of it. It took me 3 days/viewings to finish. I'm glad I'm not suicidal. This would've put me over.
941,nomadland,audience,4.5,p,"This movie was a powerful character study giving a glimpse into current events.  It's rather unassuming and kind of plods along however, the cumulative effect is a look into the life at somebody that society has left behind."
942,nomadland,audience,3.5,p,"This simple drifter movie is pleasant for anyone who ever wanted to just let it all go, sell everything, and be one with the land, via a van. I think at this point in Frances McDormand's non-beautiful person pilgrimage she has been on, we get it, you're at a point in your career where all you want to do is show up on set with as little prep-time as possible and call it art. In this film, the co-stars came off more authentic to the mission, how to live life in your older age without becoming a burden to those you love."
943,nomadland,audience,1.0,n,I just didn't care about any of these people.  It was over the top but trying to be real.  It was depressing for no reason other than to be depressing.  The premise itself felt unlikely at least with how the homeless people acted as a community while they were all over the country.  Felt like an opportunity for Frances McDormand to do something the academy would appreciate.
944,nomadland,audience,4.5,p,I think Frances is an alien. Only an alien could play that good.
945,nomadland,audience,5.0,p,O talento de Choë zháo fez toda a diferença para a construção de um ótimo filme.
946,nomadland,audience,5.0,p,"Not all movies need to be a thoroughly developed story with character arches or a mapped out plot. In fact, if Nomadland was anything like another traditional Hollywood film it's tale would ring both cliché and disingenuous.

Instead, Nomadland is a story anyone can relate to: where do you go when you have nothing left in life? Taking a setup based on the growing epidemic of homelessness in America particularly in the early 2010's following the great recession, the film focuses on Frances McDormand's Fern. Fern is an ageing woman who lives the life of a nomad, traveling and living in her van after her husband dies and the small town they share becomes all but abandoned.

The film follows what is a seemingly aimless woman among countless equally aimless folks who are all merely making their way in an aimless new way of life. Sprinkled with glints of happiness, hope as much as small tragedies-- Nomadland plays something like a documentary of one woman's travels.

It's beautifully shot, subtly acted, emotionally investing and very much worth the journey."
947,judas_and_the_black_messiah,critics,fresh,p,King directs with such gravitas and command; it's not a film you'll forget anytime soon.
948,judas_and_the_black_messiah,critics,fresh,p,A grand historical drama about both practical heroism and tragic cowardice.
949,judas_and_the_black_messiah,critics,fresh,p,"Lakeith Stanfield, Dominque Fishback and Jesse Plemons are all fantastic in their respective roles, but of course the standout here is Daniel Kaluuya."
950,judas_and_the_black_messiah,critics,fresh,p,"Get Out alum Lakeith Stanfield works an effective counterpoint to Kaluuya, moving with an ease that seems like the instinctive way a newcomer could insinuate himself into a tight-knit organization."
951,judas_and_the_black_messiah,critics,fresh,p,The acting is sensational. Both LaKeith Stanfield and Daniel Kaluuya give knockout performances.
952,judas_and_the_black_messiah,critics,fresh,p,"Its message and story are tragically timeless, and radicalizing only in their plain honesty about true events."
953,judas_and_the_black_messiah,critics,fresh,p,"King manages to vindicate these revolutionary figures. As Fred himself said, ""You can kill the revolutionary, but you cannot kill the revolution."" [Full review in Spanish]"
954,judas_and_the_black_messiah,critics,fresh,p,"Gifted as Hampton was with rare oratorial skills, the film on his life also tries to spin magic with his words..."
955,judas_and_the_black_messiah,critics,fresh,p,"The result is a tangle that strains under the pull of its disparate threads - those of crime thriller, biography and study of a grassroots movement. King manages to hold it together, but barely."
956,judas_and_the_black_messiah,critics,fresh,p,"To quote ""The Insider"" - fame lasts fifteen minutes, infamy lasts a whole lot longer."
957,judas_and_the_black_messiah,critics,fresh,p,"This is a film that lingers, even when it seems to be struggling with varying parts of itself."
958,judas_and_the_black_messiah,critics,fresh,p,"A stirring and important work, with issues and attitudes that even today stubbornly refuse to exit the country."
959,judas_and_the_black_messiah,critics,fresh,p,"Kaluuya is rousing as Hampton, for sure...Stanfield, though, is subtle, in control, doesn't veer from his usual brilliance, and still creates an accurate portrayal of William O'Neal..."
960,judas_and_the_black_messiah,critics,fresh,p,The film has the look and sound of a stylish thriller.
961,judas_and_the_black_messiah,critics,fresh,p,"Both men are superb, Standfield quieter, and unsympathetic, and Kaluuya in the more showy part, which earned him his Oscar-winning Supporting Actor nomination."
962,judas_and_the_black_messiah,critics,fresh,p,"With electric performances and the perfect level of emotion across the board, JATBM is powerful, affecting, and one of the year's best already."
963,judas_and_the_black_messiah,critics,fresh,p,"We've seen a lot of undercover-cop films, and I thought Spike Lee's BlacKkKlansman might have put the subgenre to bed, but this film has a Shakespearean-tragedy tinge to it."
964,judas_and_the_black_messiah,critics,fresh,p,...a fairly conventional yet mostly compelling drama...
965,judas_and_the_black_messiah,critics,fresh,p,"Shaka King writes and directs this political thriller in which he manages the rhythm between the most intimate, informative and revolutionary sequences well. [Full review in Spanish]"
966,judas_and_the_black_messiah,critics,fresh,p,"Black lives splatter: ""Words are beautiful, actions supreme"""
967,judas_and_the_black_messiah,audience,4.0,p,Incredible performances.
968,judas_and_the_black_messiah,audience,4.0,p,The acting was great but I wouldn't say there was anything unexpected that made the movie stand out. Definitely enjoyed it and learned from it.
969,judas_and_the_black_messiah,audience,3.0,p,A little boring and unfulfilled potential for me.
970,judas_and_the_black_messiah,audience,4.0,p,"What would young people do today if faced with the same situation, as Mr. Hampton and his officials did? That's the context you should watch this movie, and then read the history of the story, and you'll understand the genius of this man. Black or not, this is a film about using the power of your youth to drive a world you want to see, knowing you won't get there to see it. Take that social media justice warriors!"
971,judas_and_the_black_messiah,audience,2.5,n,"Before I get into this review, I have to say the soundtrack(or at least this one tune that's part of the soundtrack) really annoyed me. It plays in the beginning before Bill goes into the bar and once again near the end when he's getting the drugs to off Fred. To me it sounded like a very loud and weirdly annoying train and each time I just had to hit the mute button. Anyways, for the movie itself.. it was alright, but a bit too long for my taste. Depressing a bit, cops killing blacks in the late 60's in Chicago and one of the guys in the Black Panther party is an undercover guy working for the FBI because of a stolen car. Sucks that this is the way of the totally not racist America(:sarcasm alert:) but that's the reality we live in, even today."
972,judas_and_the_black_messiah,audience,4.5,p,"Visceral and, unfortunately, timeless. Kaluuya and Stanfield are electrifying but the score of Mark Isham and Craig Harris hit the hardest."
973,judas_and_the_black_messiah,audience,4.5,p,"As someone not educated in this area of history, I was absolutely blown away by this film and enjoyed learning the harrowing tale told through the well written and paced narrative, that is as intense as it is heart wrenching. The film is a technical marvel, with immaculate, time period accurate production design and visuals, supported by an immersive soundtrack. It is also superbly acted and very well shot.
8.83/10"
974,judas_and_the_black_messiah,audience,4.0,p,"Film importante, che ha l'immenso pregio di non porre in secondo piano la qualità rispetto alla ricerca del compiacimento del pubblico.
Non ci sono facili colpi di scena, ne personaggi ""manichino"" volti ad abbellire il cast.
Si punta tutto sulla grandissima qualità della sceneggiatura e sull'ottima credibilità del cast; in special modo su uno degli astri nascenti del cinema quale Daniel Kaluuya, in grado di rappresentare con grandissima intensità un personaggio che per tutto il film non usa mai il suo corpo o le sue espressioni in maniera esagerata; ma che colpisce solamente con lo sguardo e con le parole.
Il finale è scioccante tanto da lasciare interdetti nella maniera più assoluta; le didascalie finali offrono il giusto resoconto per permettere di essere a conoscenza anche dei fatti tralasciati per ragioni cinematografiche."
975,judas_and_the_black_messiah,audience,5.0,p,"I love this movie. I was aware of who Fred Hampton was but this movie depicted him and the movie so well, I can't get over it."
976,judas_and_the_black_messiah,audience,5.0,p,"9.5/10


""I'm gonna die for the people cause I live for the people, I live for the people cause I love the people"" 


Holy crap can we just give Daniel Kaluuya all the awards this season for the ""I am a revolutionary"" speech sequence in this movie"
977,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Though we'd love to see a Deaf story that doesn't need to use a Hearing protagonist as an ""entry point,"" the unique and under-seen family dynamic portrayed on screen still feels fresh."

982,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"What really works about this film are the rougher edges, the moments of ambivalence on the margins (and even at the centre) and its firm awareness of uncertainty."
983,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,A love letter to family
984,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"With warmth, humor and a strong cast, CODA has turned a conventional family dynamic and an oft-told tale of a teenager pursuing her dream into something special."
985,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,The naturalness and honesty of the dialogues... is what makes CODA an enjoyable film. [Full review in Spanish]
986,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"CODA's story is quite powerful... The rest of the plot about self-improvement and fighting for the right thing can be trite, but it works, and it works very well. [Full review in Spanish]"
987,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Whether a remake had been absolutely necessary for this is a matter of opinion. But on its own, CODA is a nice crowd-pleaser. [Full review in Spanish]"
988,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Not bad, the actors are very convincing but, I insist, is there no way for the gringos to read subtitles and watch the original films? In this case, La famille Bélier, was a much better movie."
989,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Heder takes the movie in various directions with its mix of coming-of-age drama, high school angst, broad comedy, and working-class themes, but it all works, coming together as a memorable family movie night pick for parents with teens."
990,coda_2021,critics,rotten,n,"Lamentably, only the humorous moments prevail."
991,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"What I loved about Sian Heder's film, the title of which stands for Child of Deaf Adults, is that it created magic without much effort or showing off."
992,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Predictable, yes, but no reasonable person wants failure for this genuinely warm and loving family."
993,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Heder cuts to silence during Ruby's solo at the school choir concert in order to give us the family's perspective, and the effect is as profound as it is heartbreaking."
994,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Films like CODA represent a changing of the Hollywood guard - more folks at the table, putting people in the jobs they should've had all along."
995,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,"Try not to be moved by this loving, needy, overwhelmed and surprisingly horny family confronting change."
996,coda_2021,critics,fresh,p,Bravo to co-writer and sole director Sian Heder for breathing fresh life into an old but reliable storyline.
997,coda_2021,audience,4.5,p,"Well-paced, compelling, great cast and songs. One of the best films of the year."
998,coda_2021,audience,5.0,p,"This movie does everything a coming-of-age film should do, but goes one step further. It shines a light on topics rarely seen in films. A truly heartwarming movie. Possibly my favourite film of the year."
999,coda_2021,audience,4.5,p,"CODA (A) 
A brilliant piece of art that will have you all wrapped up in the story. It is very heartfelt and even though everyone may not be able to relate to having close people in their lives that are deaf they will be easily able to relate to the themes this story effortlessly presents. You can tell a lot of care went into making this film and it really comes off as feeling super authentic. I realized as I was watching it how much I began to care about the characters and I was really hoping everything would go well for them all. I felt that I had been apart of the story with how relatable it is and how well it is acted out and directed. I did feel that the middle section lost a little bit of traction with the story maybe staying a little to long in some scenes. The last section of this film however is very powerful and moving. You see this family grow through trials and the final payoff of the film really rewards viewers for becoming engaged in  the film. The film left me feeling joyful and excited to take on my own personal  next steps in this crazy thing we call life. In my opinion this is a must watch and a film that should not be overlooked."
1000,coda_2021,audience,5.0,p,Movie Perfection. Guaranteed to make you cry.
1001,coda_2021,audience,5.0,p,"An absolute masterpiece, combining humor and sentimentality. I'm getting a lot of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" vibes, with the quirky characters coming together. Eugenio Derbez Steals the show as the music teacher and Troy Kotsur is fantastic!  Emilia Jones is a talent that will only grow, and Sian Heder‘a steady and confident direction and script is a Masterclass in narrative storytelling. Even though the film takes place in a small New England town, the scope is still there with lush clouds and a shiny sun on the sea. I cried three times in the third act. Truly a work of art."
1002,coda_2021,audience,5.0,p,"Coming from almost the same exact situation, this movie brought out the belly laughs and the tears of joy all in one. Growing up with deaf parents (but with 2 hearing older sisters), there isn't enough praise that I could give this movie. It was just like reliving my child hood. With the weed smoking, hearing the bed squeeking, to being the interpreter for all diffrent types of situations 😊 haha. Thank you for giving some insight into how hard it could be with not only the kids that could hear but the parents as well. This movie to me is just as much as a tribute to the lead character who could hear as well as the two deaf parents who over came their diversity to their surroundings and actually stood out and above alot of the other people in their community. It's a triple A movie ""Amazing, Amazing,  Amazing""!!"
1003,coda_2021,audience,3.0,p,"It's full of clichés and it's very predictable and there are many films out there with similar stories. But, at the same time i feel like it is very well made with great acting and to my surprise an interesting cinematography.
Didn't love it but it is enjoyable."
1004,coda_2021,audience,3.5,p,"In CODA, the beautiful and the cliche walk alongside, producing a feel-good family-friendly film that, although not particularly innovative, lets us take a glance at the lives of a culturally deaf family in a mature approach."
1005,coda_2021,audience,4.0,p,"Troy Kotsur is marvelous in this movie. I loved it, even though some scenes were a bit too on the nose. Nice family movie."
1006,coda_2021,audience,5.0,p,"Coda is this years absolute crowdpleaser, offering a masterfully enjoyable coming-of-age story in which not only the younger characters get it to their fullest potential, but the elders elevate their material to equal heights. Its impressive cast deserves all the awards and praise for this."
1007,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"The Power of the Dog is essential viewing for cinema fans, a brilliant example of a non-Western Western and another stellar entry in award-winning Campion's canon."
1008,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"With a great cast, fantastic score, and breathtaking environments, The Power of the Dog is a film worth watching."

1010,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,An overwhelming psychological thriller. [Full review in Spanish]
1011,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"[A] brilliant and haunting piece of filmmaking...[a] tale of how we too often tear others down because we can't stop tearing ourselves apart...harsh but beautiful, unforgettable but unforgiving ... exquisitely isolating."
1012,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"The Power of the Dog features some of the best performances you'll see all year with gorgeous cinematography, a fantastic ending, and an almost horror movie-like atmosphere proceeding over the entire enterprise."
1013,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"While the movie offers little in the way of catharsis, it's an undeniably powerful experience, as stark as those hills from the first shot."
1014,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"Campion handles such psychological denseness with virtuoso control, often whittling scenes to snippets of emotion and innuendo."
1015,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,Jane Campion's film quietly sneaks up on you if you're willing to settle in with it. She's the kind of director who wants the audience to do part of the work without forcing every emotion and action on to us.
1016,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"The Power of the Dog gives an unflinching and riveting portrait of toxic masculinity, homophobia, and family tensions. Even though the movie is set in 1925 Montana, the themes are universal and timeless ... It's intriguing cinematic art."
1017,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"It's not your typical shoot-em up Western, by any means. It's a sophisticated arthouse piece that requires avid thought and attention."
1018,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"The film opens with an air of ""There Will Be Blood"" before morphing into full-blown ""A Streetcar Named Desire,"" then flirts with ""Call Me By Your Name"" before landing somewhere between ""The Beguiled"" and ""Basic Instinct."""
1019,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"It's not subtle, with certain objects taking on blunt, heavy symbolic weight - paper flowers, cigarettes, a saddle, a rawhide lariat, shadows on hillsides. But it has a tense, unsettling power as it moves towards an unexpected ending."
1020,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"Campion has lost none of her potency, using the landscape, and even the earth itself, to tell this primal, feral story."
1021,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,rotten,n,"Campion is a master director, more about poetry than cinematic energy. An uneasy watch but a destructive investigation on feminism and family...but ultimately all a chore to watch."
1022,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"Without the complex layers to Phil's character and motivations, it might have been just an exercise in endurance, but it was a breathtaking and suspenseful human mystery instead."
1023,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,We're talking about this when it comes to awards season.
1024,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"Campion treats the material with such well-mannered reverence that you begin to wish that not just the characters, but she too, would loosen up a bit."

1026,the_power_of_the_dog,critics,fresh,p,"Jane Campion's eighth feature film, her first in 12 years, The Power of the Dog reconfirms the director as a powerful force in contemporary cinema."

1029,the_power_of_the_dog,audience,4.0,p,"On first sight a very slow paced movie where not a lot happens, but after looking up the meaning of the story afterwards, everything fell into place and I immediately wanted to watch it again with a new perspective. Sublime filmmaking."
1030,the_power_of_the_dog,audience,0.5,n,Slow and uninteresting.
1031,the_power_of_the_dog,audience,5.0,p,"Breathtaking. From the first to last the scene. And it the end it will crack your heart. 

Outstanding performances of Benedict Cumberbatch, Kodi Smit-McPhee and Kirsten Dunst. Amazing work by director Jane Campion.  

Must watch!"
1032,the_power_of_the_dog,audience,0.5,n,"Great acting? Sure. Everything else? Awful. Slow, boring, story was painfully bad. And thanks again Hollywood for trying to normalize an older man taking advantage of a young man/boy. But hey it was cold out, right? Ugh. Surely this will win picture of the year…"
1033,the_power_of_the_dog,audience,3.5,p,"This is the absolute example of why movies need to be seen in a movie theatre and not at home on the couch.  With the slow and plodding pace, I must have stopped 10 times to do something else.  Perhaps in a movie theatre where I am enveloped by the spectacular cinematography and haunting score I would have been more vested in the film.  However, as it is, this is the quintessential ""critics"" movie."
1034,the_power_of_the_dog,audience,4.5,p,Fantastic film and excellent performances from the four leads. I especially loved that the ending wasn't spelt out for the audience
1035,the_power_of_the_dog,audience,3.0,p,Slow and plot is slightly confusing
1036,the_power_of_the_dog,audience,0.5,n,"Ok The Power of dog was not only strangely pretentious art  but excruciatingly slow. Painful characters. A most agonizing unrewarding ending. I can't even describe further. I can only say i  survived the film. Barely. 
In addition,  I may never be able to look at Benedict Cumberbatch act again, Dr Strange notwithstanding.
Jane Campion hates people, pianos and men in particular. I wish my brain could throw up"
1037,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Funny, sad, thoughtful, endearing, it's one of those movies that gets everything right. Yes, it's an astutely observed insight to the immigrant experience in 1980s USA, but it's also just a great movie about human beings being awesome."
1038,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Young Alan Kim's performance is essential, as it serves as a rear window to a marriage filled with uncertainty and dissatisfaction. A story about the challenges of immigrating and creating a family while still wanting success. [Full review in Spanish]"
1039,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Everything in Minari combines to create a compelling family drama that is powerful, emotional, and intensely authentic."
1040,minari,critics,fresh,p,The humanity with which it treats every single one of its characters is deeply moving and makes Minari one of the most emotionally resonant films of the year.

1042,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Chung and his cinematographer Lachlan Milne photograph the landscape beautifully, and you see how both Jacob and David can be entranced by its vastness, even for all the trouble it causes."
1043,minari,critics,fresh,p,"As a film, Minari absolutely flourishes, emanating a sweet freshness that sets it apart as a distinct reminder that the world is full of many flavors."
1044,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Minari is a moving, beautiful delight about struggle-struggle financially, struggle for identity, against preconceived notions, and for unity."
1045,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Wistful and passionate, Minari is a gorgeously crafted film that synthesises the bittersweet pleasures of staying true to your past -- and making space for your future."
1046,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Lee Isaac Chung's quiet, restrained film examines the American immigrant experience."
1047,minari,critics,fresh,p,"In the end, Minari tells us about the difficulty of being, both as a solitary entity, as a member of a family, defeating the group over unity. [Full Review in Spanish]"
1048,minari,critics,fresh,p,"It's an invitation to sit with the writer/director, Lee Isaac Chung, as he shares his childhood memories of loss, identity, and the third culture created when two collide into one another."
1049,minari,critics,fresh,p,"In exploring the rich, textured lives of the Yi family, Chung manages to find the universal in specificity and specificity in the universal, an accomplishment that looks much easier than it really is."
1050,minari,critics,rotten,n,"In turning his camera to more personal material ... Chung seems to have flattened Minari into a rather precious series of vignettes -- varied in subject, but simplistic in tone."
1051,minari,critics,fresh,p,"Filmmaking-wise, Minari excels in nearly every aspect."
1052,minari,critics,fresh,p,It's a tale so universal that you will bask in their victories like they are your own and your heart will shatter at the losses.

1059,minari,audience,4.5,p,"This was definitely a good film. In spite of all the hardships and all the scares, I had more than a good laugh and a lot of warm feelings inside afterwards. Good stuff."
1060,minari,audience,5.0,p,"This movie hits hard in a good way. Minari is a really inspiring film about a Korean family who move from California to Arkansas to farm. Packed with gorgeous cinematography, and endless emotions it is a truly stunning achivement. I love how it shows what Korean life can be like on a farm in Arkansas, where the house is a raised mobile home, the film potrays this so well and just the event of moving. Movie also deals with sickness and loss in a beautiful detail. I defiently reccomend Minari."
1061,minari,audience,4.5,p,Should have won best picture 9/10
1062,minari,audience,4.0,p,The best Korean movie.
1063,minari,audience,4.5,p,"This is a semi authobiographical film of Director Chung's upbringing.  A story about immigration and starting life in the United States, it rings true to it's present day as a Korean family plops onto an Arkansas farm.  It is modest and specific.  It presents childhood as authentic.  There is perhaps no film more American than this, despite it being almost entirely in Korean."
1064,minari,audience,4.0,p,"When they say movies are a window into the lives of characters, or story or a peek into history, Minari is such a film. Image starting a life with limited resources, but dreaming big, in a place that doesn't dream big? Would you survive, or would you give up to fit in? Now, watch Minari, and you'll appreciate this simple tale of the family comes first storyline."
1065,minari,audience,3.0,p,"Minari is great. It builds on lofty ideals to execute a deeply personal view of both a family, some characters, and the world they inhabit. It's devoid of most of the things you'd expect from a film with such lofty ambitions. It trades forward-thinking cultural commentary for a much more subtle, much more modest view of family, togetherness, and accepting things as they come. 

Some say that this film represents an American dream. And I think it's better to say that this is an American tragedy; those who have seen the film will likely agree. But those little tragedies that fill every life lead to a fulfilling whole. That whole is filled with life, all joys and problems combined into an ugly mess of something. What that ""something"" is will be unique to everyone, but this ""something"" exemplifies the uniqueness of so many different people.

Okay, that's lovely, poetic talk. But this doesn't explain why the film is great. And in a lot of ways, it's premise is its downfall. It is modest almost to a fault. It's so diligently exploring this one, tiny example of reality that it really takes the power of the entire film to carry it across the finish line. While the score is and directing is fantastic, the drama on display simple and stern, and the overall execution fine, it definitely feels like a film that is doing its best to wrap up into a cohesive whole. It stumbles, very similarly to the family in the story; Minari can be very unclean, and obtuse at times. You might be looking for that meaning the film is obviously trying to communicate, but it can seem elusive, as if the film is trying to hide itself from you as a viewer.

But this film is for the climax. The film may meander throughout its second act, but its third act is a beacon, really grabbing you as a viewer and captivating you with the excellent performances of the actors. It's able to wrap up all its themes in fantastic fashion. Does that make up for its confusing arc, just because the conclusion is good? That's debatable. But you can't argue results, once you get to the end of everything.

In the end, Minari is a messy and confusing film, but one that is worth the time. It is certainly unique, and definitely hits the mark it was aiming for. The form may leave a lot to be desired, but the execution is all that matters."
1066,minari,audience,5.0,p,"An arrestingly tranquil motion picture, that at the same time is as powerful as all the performances in it. Chungs' 2020 feature debut brims with bright sunshine and blue moonlight, a stunning look at the American dream."
1067,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,It grips you immediately.

1069,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"It doesn't pack the psychological punch of Get Out, but Us confirms that Jordan Peele's phenomenal debut film was no fluke -- and the praise he's given is indeed well deserved."
1070,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Similar to his first film, Peele practically demands multiple viewings."
1071,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,It's a film that confirms Peele as that rarest of things - a true auteur.
1072,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,Jordan Peele returns with another inventive and ambitious psychological horror film.
1073,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"There's a messiness here, a beautiful anamorphic widescreen messiness that Peele seems to relish."
1074,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Us introduces so many ideas that it can be difficult to focus. But it's fascinating to watch those ideas emerge, contort and dance around on screen, even if they don't always come together to form a cohesive story."
1075,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,An outlandish story but the powerful message resonates in Trump era America.
1076,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"While imperfect, Peele and his team get enough right with Us to make it a worthy follow-up to Get Out. Combining popcorn thrills with thoughtful commentary is Peele's calling card, something that should make him a director to watch for years to come."
1077,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Smart and quick witted, Peele knows when he needs to be obvious - title Us also doubles as US, as above so below/mirror image concept, in a pivotal moment, and when to be subtle - ok, not really."
1078,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,The best advice I got before heading to the theater was just not to think too hard about it.
1079,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Us is a perfect storm of horror, acting, and social commentary: a beautiful dark mirror that conveys a confidence seldom seen in sophomore efforts."
1080,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"What sets Us apart from others in the genre, and likewise Peele apart from his contemporaries, is the voice that whispers a warning in every scene, a foreboding that follows you out of the theater and into your sleeping subconscious."
1081,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Jordan Peele delivers more of his now signature style, but also flips a switch on something you'd never expect. His ability to create another flawless and compelling story truly cements himself as a true Master of Horror."
1082,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,I love this film... in so many different ways.
1083,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"The cast is first-rate, while the cinematography, framing, and editing all sensationally contribute to the supremely disconcerting ordeals."
1084,us_2019,critics,rotten,n,The plot twists don't always add up and there are too many red herrings that create a sense of disappointment as Peele doesn't follow through.
1085,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"Peele's eagerly awaited second feature is here, and Us does not disappoint."
1086,us_2019,critics,fresh,p,"With Us, another simplistic yet petrifying demonstration of the confrontational, Jordan Peele has announced himself as a master of horror."
1087,us_2019,audience,4.5,p,"Honestly the end was shocking but I still don't get it. It was an amazing movie. The end is very vague and even though they explain it, my dumb ass doesn't understand it. But the shocking plot twist was amazing. LOVE IT!"
1088,us_2019,audience,5.0,p,"Would you like some hot fresh nightmare fuel? Then step this way. I don't want to say much more about ""Us"" for fear of spoiling it, but suffice it to say, the performances – especially from Lupita Nyong'o – are phenomenal and the plot kept me captivated through its twists and turns."

1090,us_2019,audience,4.0,p,"great concept, eerie but not too dark, amazing plot twist"
1091,us_2019,audience,1.0,n,"Get Out was great. This movie was a mess. It takes every cliche from all the great B movies and churns them into a movie that makes no sense. I kept waiting for some explanation or something that would salvage this film, but it never came. If you start to ask questions like ""Why do they have scissors?"" or wear red jumps suits when there are not wearing them in other parts etc... Wait till you can see it for free and then it might be worth it."
1092,us_2019,audience,4.0,p,"A follow up by Jordan Peele completely beats the ""sophomore jinx.""  It is a horror film that that cites tropes and precedents of horror in order to deeply root the film in the terrain of pop culture and then pull up those roots."
1093,us_2019,audience,5.0,p,"Another Jordan Peele masterpiece. Stunningly acted, beautifully directed, the score is 10-10. Slight better than get out and that's saying a lot because Get Out is amazing. Highly recommend"
1094,us_2019,audience,4.5,p,"The unique story, plot and just everything is perfect."
1095,us_2019,audience,3.5,p,A really good horror movie but ultimately let down by its final act. Lupita Nyong'o is awesome but has to carry the film due to a less-than-outstanding cast (with the notable exception of Shahadi Wright Joseph).
1096,us_2019,audience,5.0,p,One of the scariest movies I've seen recently. It made me re afraid of the dark for a couple days after watching the movie.
1097,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,An incredibly subtle example of cinematic virtuosity and poetry.
1098,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,Watching this film provided me with three of the most spellbinding hours that I spent watching movies this year.
1099,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,Moments bloom into radiant life.
1100,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,"For a century and more, film directors have explored crosscurrents between art and life, and how one informs the other. Hamaguchi makes that exploration a fully humanized one."
1101,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,Drive My Car is one of 2021's best films.
1102,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,"The film firmly establishes its lonely and wounded characters, its melancholy tone, and its empathetic philosophy of the lost finding connections with each other."
1103,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,"Slow to build and with an assembly of characters who are all more complex than they seem on the surface, Drive My Car exemplifies Japan's growing body of literary cinema."
1104,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,"With Drive My Car, Ryûsuke Hamaguchi crafts an emotional epic. It's a road movie through the soul and an odyssey well worth taking. You'll feel transformed by the journey's end."
1105,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,Hidetoshi Nishijima is spectacular in this film.
1106,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,It's beautiful in every conceivable way.
1107,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,"There is a deep richness to the film, especially in Yûsuke's emotional journey, and Hamaguchi does an excellent job of letting his characters' secrets unfold naturally."
1108,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,It feels as expansive as the whole world.
1109,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,"It feels like it moves at a clip even though, yes, it's at three hours. Very much worth a watch."
1110,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,The characters' relationships and internal drama is the key to Drive my Car. [Full review in Spanish]
1111,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,For many of us who may feel like we've stalled in our own great loss. Discovering Drive My Car may just give you the power to propel forward once more. A remarkable work that will stick with me for some time yet.
1112,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,"Ambitious and yet quietly confident, Hamaguchi's film feels an absolute treat."
1113,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,What begins as a shuttle between home and rehearsal spaces ends up taking the pair across Japan and on a journey through memory and loss.
1114,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,Hidetoshi Shinomiya's cinematography makes a trip to the dump look poetic. The entire ensemble is remarkable.
1115,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,"Drive My Car is a rich and wonderfully soothing work, a film that only further confirms Hamaguchi as one of the finest directors working today."
1116,drive_my_car,critics,fresh,p,"Drive My Car is an evocative display of our capacity for empathy, our need for change, and the catharsis of art and creation."
1117,drive_my_car,audience,3.5,p,"Drive My Car is a slow burning, subtle film about a man confronting and accepting paradoxical truths - his wife loved him, yet cheated on him. He is able to do this only through the power of fiction (i.e. not truth) through his acting on stage and being paired with a stoic driver. Through it all, they learn that life is messy and you just have to keep on living. Usually, these kinds of films go over my head a bit, and this did as well, still it was an interesting film to watch. I'm not sure I completely go it, but I was still very much engaged."
1118,drive_my_car,audience,5.0,p,"I remembered reading the original story and this film nails it in a slow, sumptuous glory. The slightly-bright washed out colour palette, the red car, the sheer and wonderful mix of characters make it a great film to watch on so many levels: the cinematography, the acting, the storyline."
1119,drive_my_car,audience,5.0,p,Great story. As a screenwriter I especially appreciated the bit about screenwriting while in the midst of sex. Awesome!
1120,drive_my_car,audience,5.0,p,Drive My Car is a masterclass in writing that retains the spirit of Haruki Murakami's short story while taking some interesting original turns in the road.
1121,drive_my_car,audience,4.0,p,"Maybe a little long in the tooth, Drive My Car is a excellent story about grief, self-acceptance and the struggles of letting go. Its performed outstandingly across the board, packed with a beautiful score and enough room to breathe."
1122,drive_my_car,audience,2.5,n,"Waaay too long.  Interesting story, but couldn't they do it in less than three hours?"
1123,drive_my_car,audience,4.0,p,"Started out on a seemingly distasteful note, then proceeded at a soporific face, but then, 20 minutes or so later, woke you up in a fell swoop and didn't let go, embodying pure magic of cinema and looking more original than any recent movie I could think of – up until the end where one ill-conceived, distracting, and unnecessary scene (the distant village in the snow) dispelled the magic and made you wish the film had ended a bit sooner. Still, head and shoulders above most new films of recent years."
1124,drive_my_car,audience,4.0,p,"beautiful cinematography and a great adapted script, the film explores the diverse convictions of its characters, which leads to different dialogues. Because of that, it ends up becoming long and heavy, but it's an incredible 3 hours."
1125,drive_my_car,audience,5.0,p,A Masterpiece unlike any other film!
1126,drive_my_car,audience,5.0,p,"I loved this film, the story, the acting, the parts of Japan that made me want to go back . At no time did I feel restless- the ‘ride’ just felt smooth and seemed to fly by just like the main character described how her driving felt. I highly recommend this film though, if possible, brush up on your familiarity with Chekhov especially Uncle Vanya, before you see it."
1127,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Chicken Run, if anything, offers an alternative to a desolate world that many of us are increasingly afraid of."
1128,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,So great.
1129,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Its plump chickens maintain that strange, haptic quality that makes you yearn to reach out and squeeze them."
1130,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Even without Wallace and Gromit, most of the trademark joys are here: the compound of squashy creatures and heavy machinery, the wide, open-ended rictus of a toothy smile, and the great Parkian gulp."
1131,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"It coaxes you to laugh and cry, flatters your intelligence, and practically guarantees a cheap night out: at dinner afterward, no one's going to be ordering anything but salad."
1132,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,It's a warm-hearted and amusing entertainment that your children will enjoy.
1133,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Chickens are inherently funny, like nature's idea of a very practical joke. Park and Lord have just improved the old rubber chicken gag, making it movable, turning it into something closer to who we are and what we know as humans."
1134,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,Chicken Run is a charmingly conceived entertainment. But it's a little bit twee.
1135,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,What gives this movie its oddly strong grip on a viewer's heart is a physical tenderness inseparable from the nature of claymation.
1136,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"The claymation comedy Chicken Run is eggsactly what the doctor ordered. It's a witty, high-spirited adventure that will appeal to moviegoers of all ages. Call it chicken soup for the funny bone."
1137,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"The first feature film from England's Aardman Animation, and the first truly terrific film to be released by DreamWorks."
1138,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Most of the time Chicken Run entertains, instructs, involves and enchants."
1139,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,Run to Chicken Run. This clay-animation comedy is the most entertaining animal story since Babe.
1140,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"The film is brilliantly voiced across the board, with special notice to Mel Gibson as Rocky and Julia Sawalha as Ginger."
1141,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"The sly, sardonic flight of fancy known as Chicken Run is a delightful epic of fowl deeds, quests for freedom and poultry heroics from the off-kilter English cartoon house, Aardman Animation."
1142,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Like Wallace & Gromit, it's a paean to British eccentricity, equal parts cluelessness and hopefulness, full of English slang and dry Brit humor."
1143,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Indeed, it's the best movie comedy to come out of England since Monty Python packed up the circus."
1144,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"Chicken Run contains some gorgeous, destined-to-be-classic set pieces, and this is where the Aardman production team flex their animation muscles."
1145,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"It's nothing less than a stop-motion tour de force, bursting with charm, humor, invention and eye-popping mise en scene."
1146,chicken_run,critics,fresh,p,"With its winking homages to films like Stalag 17 and The Great Escape, Run is visually inventive, its characters plump with personality and, for a bunch of chickens, ever so brave."
1147,chicken_run,audience,4.0,p,"The voice acting is great, jokes smart, and great action sequences.  The movie uses animals as surrogates for our hopes and fears with the chickens running through one failed escape after another."
1148,chicken_run,audience,3.5,p,"An amusing claymation-style stop-motion movie (similar to ""Wallace & Gromit"") about friendship, helping others in need and teamwork. With slapstick-style comedy, the film is fun for parents as well as kids."
1149,chicken_run,audience,5.0,p,"Truly one of the defining cinematic works of our time—and no, this isn't some joke review.  Aardman carries the entirety of the claymation genre on its back, and rightly so.

1151,chicken_run,audience,5.0,p,"I used to watch it when I was a child. After 15 years, this movie is still fresh and enjoyable. The stop motion is amazing. Moreover, i found out this is an ecological and environmental reinterpretation of the Holocaust and it made me appreciate the movie even more"

1153,chicken_run,audience,3.0,p,"While Chicken Run has a great animation style and compelling characters, the plot of the film was too generic and cliche for me."
1154,chicken_run,audience,2.0,n,"I guess I'm part of the minority who isn't that impressed with the animation. The story is interesting and I get the holocaust parallels. But it just didn't keep my interest, even with the short run-time."

On the other side we have fried chicken, baked chicken, pineapple chicken, lemon chicken, coconut chicken, pepper chicken, chicken soup, chicken stew, chicken salad, chicken and potatoes, chicken burgers, chicken sandwich and chicken parmesan.
You get the idea."
1156,chicken_run,audience,5.0,p,"This movie was already way ahead of it's time back when it was released. It's not the story of ""an america  rooster who falls in love with a British chicken"", it is literally the story of a group of women enslaved workers joining forces to escape a Nazi working camp
Spoilers:
This movie has simply amazing dynamics between women, be it friendship, disagreement, protection, union, hopelessness... and the story of their visionary leader, willing to sacrifice herself so that those she lead could experience freedom. Her friendship with Mac, a woman engineer, is heartwarming especially when they see the fruit of all their hard work: their plane is ready.
Rocky is your regular selfish overconfident man, that is, until his character development brings him to be honest, to not turn a blind eye to those suffering around him, to care, and ultimately to find the courage and dignity to join the chickens' cause. Over his character development, he also finally becomes worthy of the amazing woman (or hen) Ginger is."

1162,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,Boseman's Black Panther is not only capable of fighting the bad guys but is also a vessel for the film's study of the importance of legacy and identity.

1173,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"Black Panther not only stands up as a Hollywood blockbuster but conveys an adult and chronological context that touches upon slavery, the Civil Rights movement, Black Lives Matter and the current African-American plight."
1174,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,Coogler firmly sports his crown in blurring the lines between the cultural importance Black Panther is set to play in bringing down the dinosaur illusions of Hollywood.
1175,black_panther_2018,critics,fresh,p,"It's still somewhat overstuffed with an excess of characters and some undeniable hiccups in regards to pacing, but its filmmaking is slick, and the cast oozes charisma."

1183,black_panther_2018,audience,5.0,p,"this movie was wonderful.  It broadened Marvel's diversity and opens the eyes of the audience to a new point of view, and a new type of superhero, and villain.  The villains rooted in reality motives humanize him, adding even more depth to the already rich storyline and characters. Absolutely must-see."
1184,black_panther_2018,audience,3.5,p,A great story for a Marvel movie but felt it relied too heavily on CGI at the end with some not so great choreography. RIP Chadwick...
1185,black_panther_2018,audience,5.0,p,"In today's Marvel Cinematic Universe, women and those of color or different ethnicity have come a long way. In 2018, the MCU released a film covering the entirety of African American culture, featuring Chadwick Boseman, an African American male, as the main character. This film discussed revolves around T'Challa and the African nation of Wakanda. This film can be analyzed through the ideas of international relations as the nation of Wakanda transforms from a realist state to a liberalist state."

1335,simon_sez,audience,3.0,p,"Former CIA agent ""Simon"" (""The Worm"" Dennis Rodman) is living in France minding his own business when a guy claiming to be a former classmate in a CIA training class shows up. ""Simon"" doesn't recall who this guy named ""Nick Maranda"" (Dane Cook) is. 

""Miranda"" is there to deliver a $2-million ransom for the kidnapped daughter of a businessman (Clayton Day). But the deal explodes in his face, and ""Simon"" has to use his hand-to-hand battle skills to get them out of there. After escaping, they run into a beautiful blond (Emma Sjoberg) with martial arts skills that are pretty much equal to ""Simon's"". She also wants the suitcase, and it is pretty obvious that she and ""Simon"" has a past together. 

Back at ""Simon's"" place, he and ""Miranda"" discover that the suitcase is actually filled with two heavy metal bricks and a computer disc. The two take the disc to ""Simon's"" secret base under a French monastery where two computer experts disguised as monks (John Pinette, Ricky Harris) try to decode the encripted program on the disc. 

""Simon"" and ""Miranda"" then go after the daughter (Natalia Cigliuti), who is in love with the son of the kidnapper. And she doesn't even know that she is being held for ransom. 

Now, ""Simon"", ""Miranda"" and at least one unlikely ally join forces to get the girl back. 

Let me tell you something that will be painfully obvious with the first few minutes of the movie -- Rodman is the best actor in the entire cast, except for maybe Sjoberg. The problem is that the supporting cast just tries too hard to get a laugh from the audience, and their jokes just bomb. The lead villain is completely insane -- and not in a good way. He is over-the-top and not a good villain. And the reason he wants the disc is really lame -- he wants to destroy a famed French landmark because he is sick of looking at it. 

The other thing that makes this movie pretty watchable is the martial arts fights. The fights are nicely choreographed, and are at a good pace. However, you can tell when the cast is replaced by stunt people in these scenes thanks to how they move when they are obviously wearing a harness and their faces are being hidden by the distance of the camera, a body part or a prop they are holding. 

The writing is not that good in this movie. The plot twists are poorly done in this movie, and they come across as confusing. Some of the characters who appear to be a villains turn out to be the good guys, and their turn completely escapes you. 

Another problem with this movie is that there is very little chemistry between the cast. Cook is obviously being carried by Rodman on-screen, and he is obviously trying too hard to be the comic relief. On the other hand, Sjoberg and Rodman are a bit better on-screen, but I had a little problem believing that they were a couple prior to when the film takes place because there was no spark between them. It only became obvious that the two were attracted to another when they jumped into bed while having another martial arts fight. 

Special effects in this movie is fairly typical. However, they really were cheap with the computer graphics in the villain's super computer screen. This movie was released in 1999, but it appeared that the super computer graphics were done earlier in the decade. 

I would suggest that you only see it for the fight scenes and, shockingly, Rodman."

A process server, Joe Tyler (played by Matthew Perry) is given the task of serving divorce papers on Sara Moore (Elizabeth Hurley), the wife of of a wealthy Texas businessman.  To do so he needs to contend with her attempts at evasion and the attempts of a colleague to undermine him.

You would think that the comedy of Matthew Perry and the allure of Liz Hurley would make for a decent movie.  They do the best they can, but are massively undermined by the script writers.  The movie is not funny.  The attempts at jokes are incredibly bad - even Perry with his great physical humour, timing and delivery can't make them work.  You can't polish a turd...

On the plus side (and it's the only plus), Liz Hurley does light up the screen and is a good distraction from the woefulness of the remainder of the movie.

Interesting to note that the supporting cast includes Amy Adams in one of her earliest movies.

1396,in-the-name-of-the-king-a-dungeon-siege-tale,audience,2.5,n,"""In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale"" is unlike any movie I have ever seen. Jason Statham is Farmer, a... farmer who is married with a wife and a son. Said wife gets kidnapped and said son stabbed brutally to death by some Poundland LOTR orcs controlled by Gallian, a villainous Magus played by Ray Liotta cosplaying as Liberace, who is allied with Matthew Lillard's Duke Fallow, who is the Prince John from ""Disney's Robin Hood"" through a filter of heavy drinking and excess melodrama. They wish to usurp the throne of the King, who is Bert Reynolds pretending to be Sean Connery in ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"".

Gallian also attempts to seduce Muriella, the terribly named daughter of John Rhys-Davies's Magus character Merick. He dresses like James Mackenzie's character from that old TV gameshow ""Raven"" and tries to prevent his daughter from getting involved in the plot. Despite this, she still dons armour, hangs around looking incredibly enticing to the queer femmes in the audience, and sadly doesn't get much of an Eowyn moment. Farmer's brother-in-law exists while looking like an off-brand cross between Legolas and Geralt and contributing very little to the plot. There are a group of elves in the forest who look like Peter Pan's Lost Principal Boys joined Cirque du Soleil and they can somehow control vines. This is never explained. The King's army has a platoon of ninjas. Ron Perlman is there.

If you're looking for something really stupid that you can roast with your friends while drinking heavily, this is the perfect film for you. Know what it is going in and you won't be disappointed. But you will probably feel a lot of vicarious embarrassment for everybody involved."

Meanwhile,  the director character, played by Don Johnson,  is an affectionate ""homage"" to Burt Reynold's character in ""Boogie Nights.""  More memorably, star Nick Swardson has created a character that is so naive and nice making him the brunt of all the silly situations, yet somehow retaining a sweetness, a likability in his interactions with everyone else, especially with his loving Midwestern parents and the charming, though hardly believable, relationship with the beautiful, kind waitress he meets. Christina Riici is outstanding here.  (In their first intimate moment, she asks if he has protection and he wonders if she means if he carries a knife.)   ""Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star"" is certainly not for children or those with delicate sensibilities, but its preposterous situations and dialogue will surely make you laugh."

As someone who generally dislike Nick Cage as an actor, he stands out here; I spent a good 10 minutes researching as to whether the guy with the glasses and bad nose and sloppy accent was him - and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was.  I've loved John Cusack, and wish he'd had a bigger role - but he was convincing as well.  The acting overall was better than I expected.

Criticisms include the overuse of gloppy blood being splashed around, and the occasionally thin script.  Some of the characters weren't fleshed out enough for me to care about why they weren't moral pillars of their communities.

Overall, though, this was a pleasant surprise.  Consistently gritty, and better acted than I would have guessed.  Will definitely recommend..."

1593,nina_2016,audience,1.5,n,As far as autobiographies girl Nina is definitely at the bottom of the barrel. After watching this film I learned very little about Nina and a bunch of the film is her just singing music. The movie is miss cast with what seems forced performances. The script was also pretty bad. The movie had good intentions but it’s also pretty boring.

1596,nina_2016,audience,3.0,p,"The best bit of this film is Zoe Saldana's performance as Nina Simone, I thought she was spot on playing the singer at her most self destructive. What lets the film down a little is the way it is edited.  It flits through various times in her life often without purpose.  The focus is on Nina's later years and her relationship with her assistant who tried his best to look after the singer and save her career.  It's a film with a strong decent lead and some very good music, it's just a shame that the rest of the film can't lift this up to the level of better musical biopics such as Walk the Line, Ray, Love & Mercy, Backbeat etc"

1598,nina_2016,audience,3.5,p,"Deserved a far better response.  Whatever wingspan this thing lacks behind the camera, is well made-up-for by Saldana's own."
1599,nina_2016,audience,3.0,p,"Nina is a by-the-numbers musical biopic riddled with every conceivable cliché about ""the tortured artist."" Nina never decides what it wants to say or where it wants to take us. Saldana (Avatar, Guardians of the Galaxy) is an accomplished and bankable actress, but she doesn't look much like Simone. That has led to several complaints, including from the Simone estate. A certain integrity and seriousness of intent gleams through, but Nina is just too big a subject, and talent, to be compressed into such a small package. Ignore all the politically-correct, blackface haters. Singing aside, Zoe Saldana delivers a decent enough Nina Simone impersonation here to make you wonder what all the brouhaha was ever about. Aside from some clunky expository dialogue and a few concluding title cards, the film barely goes into how Nina ended up so broken. It does try to give her a half-hearted redemption arc, but it fails to take off without convincing the audience why Nina needs or deserves redeeming. Zoe Saldana stirred up controversy by taking the title role, because she darkened her skin with makeup to play the part. That said, she acts with the right fire and sings beautifully and evocatively. During a long, uncut performance of ""Wild Is the Wind,"" one of Simone's signature songs, we suddenly see why jazz fans swooned at her feet.

VERDICT: ""In The Zone"" - [Mixed Reaction] These kinds of movies are usually movies that had some good things, but some bad things kept it from being amazing. This rating says buy an ex-rental or a cheap price of the DVD to own. If you consider cinema, ask for people's opinion on the film. (Films that are rated 2.5 or 3 stars)"

If stars came in fourths, it would be a 1.75, mainly because it's only as good as 75% of the movies that I would normally rate a 2 in terms of horror. This is like a senseless hodgepodge of other movie plots and typical horror, takes mental health too lightly as well as misuses what potentially could have been a much better plot point, and made me get up for popcorn... TWICE. I wonder if the college whose building was on the movie poster sued the makers AFTER they saw the film... Not unwatchable, but not worth a trip to even the dollar theater."

This is honestly one of my favourite movies. The acting is great and the story line is actually pretty good, there is very predictable scenes in this movie but I don't understand why someone would give this movie a one, like come on, there's movies out there that get an 80% on here and they straight up sucked. Moral of my comment is if you haven't seen this movie by now, take my word for it, it's not awful, it's pretty decent. Not a work of art, the ending is definitely predictable but again like I said, it's good, give it a try."

1659,the_roommate,audience,1.0,n,"For a movie that's only 90 minutes, it's still really slow. There's not a lot going on. Obsessive roommate is a psycho and does psycho-stalker things. It failed to keep my interest."
1660,the_roommate,audience,1.0,n,"This is a wannabe thriller or suspense movie that doesn't deliver.
The ending is pretty much spoiled for you in the first 30min so you spend 1h knowing what is going to happen and the movie doesn't really build up effectively till it gets there so the climax doesn't work properly.
The directors work is decent though acting is mostly mediocre. The best actor was Cam Gigandet that makes a clear effort to do his job right even with bad lines and a bad story to be a part of.

It kind of reminds me of ""Single White Female""."

It is bloody and brutal. The costumes of the sports teams are cheesy and weird. The plot is good. The soundtrack is heavy metal rock that is good. If your looking for a mindless action movie.

A movie I will never cease to vindicate, and the promise of great things to come to Jaume Balagueró (REC), despite the - oddly - overrated ""The Nameless"", his debut film. ""Darkness"" has a great cast (Anna Paquin, Lena Olin, Giancarlo Giannini) and I will never understand why this film has been panned so much, despite its minor flaws."

That being said, I'm not going to say it was a good movie or anything, but I have TOTALLY seen worse. The acting wasn't that bad- it obviously wasn't even close to oscar-winning standards of course, but for the movie I think it was convincing enough. In terms of scare factor, it wasn't that scary. There aren't really any horrifying images either. Perhaps only in one scene that comes to mind. The part that was most disappointing are things in the storyline that just don't work for me:
1. The origin of this ""phone curse"". So we see that this originated when Ellie was locked in her room after getting caught physically harming her younger sister, Laurel. Ellie begins to suffer an asthma attack, who then desperately bangs on the door for help, then tries to dial her mother's number in her phone as she dies, thus beginning the phone curse, with Ellie's mother as the first victim. Not to look at it too logically, but when Ellie was first caught by her mother, hurting Laurel, I'm sure what (at least partly) brought on her asthma attack was the stress of getting caught and what this might mean for her. Obviously she has psychological issues, but perhaps she was scared her mother wouldn't love her anymore? Or she'd get sent away? Then her asthma attack begins, and she's panicking as she knows she needs medical help. She's banging on the door for her Mum to help, and tries to call her- again, for medical help, as she is in a medical emergency. So why on Earth would she even be thinking about starting some kind of ""killer phone curse"" when she's wheezing for breath and trying to get help? When you're on your last dying breath, you're panicking, and gasping for air, not planning out a whole (not to mention, supernatural) revenge. How a child would even think of that is beyond me- Ellie was pretty young. She had her issues, but she was just a kid after all, what gave her the ability to create such a curse?
2. After the cop is killed near the end of the film, we see an unfriendly spirit of Ellie approaching Beth (likely to kill her). We then see the saviour-looking spirit of Ellie's mother grab spirit-Ellie and pull her away from Beth, where we also see light (presented as the ""phone curse"") get sucked out of the dead cop's phone (which at this point would normally have already dialled the next victim) presumably putting an end to Ellie's cellular rampage. Yet once the spirit commotion is over, the late cop's phone dials the next victim's phone number. Why on Earth would you show a triumphant spirit, triumphantly end the curse, to only seconds later, just show the curse still active. Director just booked in a cheap ending.

Nevertheless, this movie still earns 3 stars as the premise was intriguing, and still fairly entertaining to watch despite the story problems. As far as horror movies go, there really is much worse than this."

This movie also could have been given a different name as it could have been just a romantic comedy featuring Travolta and Alley with the evil, horny female boss trying to take advantage of her sexy pilot.

Mac And Me doesn't care at all what you think of it. Where ET had moments of a beautiful friendship, Mac And Me had insensitive stereotypes. Where ET pulled at heart-strings and left viewers in tears, Mac And Me has a 8 minute dance sequence in a McDonald's restaurant.

1835,material_girls,audience,0.5,n,"When I tell people that I watch any type of film, I really do mean it. Though I am a guy, I'm certainly not above watching chick flicks. However, that being said, chick flicks have also given me some of the worst film-watching experiences I've ever had that still scar me years after watching them. Sometimes I even shudder as I recall the experiences of watching them.

I know there are female viewers that try to say that these films are escapist entertainment, much like what us guys watch when it comes to action films or gross out comedies, but even the stupidest of those films still have some level of respect for their viewers, even if it is rather minimal at times. With a film like Material Girls, it has no respect for its viewers. It views its audience as a bunch of prissy, whiny, stupid, glamor-obsessed girls with roughly the same brain cell count as a cardboard box, while throwing in a half-assed moral message that means nothing in the end.

It's a film that thinks if it sticks popular (At the time, of course) preteen icons for girls into a film, fashion, annoying pop music, romantic cliches so lazy you'll want to vomit, pop culture references, and a gamut of other things that plague chick flicks, that it can just get away with being a piece of shit because of its ""target audience"" which is quite shameful. Oh no, Material Girls, I'm not letting you get away.

Sisters Tanzie and Ava (Real-life sisters, Hilary and Haylie Duff) are two rich girls who spend all their time partying and shopping, as they inherited their late father's cosmetics company, even though they do nothing to help run it. They are simply riding on the cash flow from the company.

But, Tanzie still dearly misses her father, even watching an old TiVo recording of him promoting his cosmetics every now and then and refusing to erase it, despite pressures from her sister to do so.

But one day, their lives are turned upside down when a tabloid program claims that the company's cosmetic products cause terrible skin conditions, threatening to destroy the company, causing their assets to be frozen, having an angry mob after them, and losing all of their so-called ""friends"" in the process.

While at home in their mansion, with an angry mob outside their gates, a fire is accidentally started, burning down their mansion and forcing them to stay with their maid, since their credit cards are no longer active and they can't stay anywhere else. They are now homeless, broke, jobless, and completely clueless as they have no idea how the outside works from their insular rich bubble of a world.

But, there is a ray of hope for the girls when a rival cosmetics company offers to buy their company for several million dollars. But, Tanzie refuses the deal, and decides to start an investigation into what is really going on at their company since she believes that they were framed, resulting in a series of supposed-to-be-funny shenanigans along the way as they investigate.

I do enjoy a good comedy about high society or takedowns of rich people (Including celebrities), but Material Girls is horribly dissatisfying in its storytelling. Even by the most minimum standards of chick flicks, this storyline is vacant and hollow, doing only the bare minimum to have a story and one-note characters so that it can be considered a film. There was absolutely no effort or care put into the storyline. This is easily one of the most lazily-written films I've ever seen. The average viewer, even if they possess no writing abilities of any sort, could write a script that would look Oscar-worthy in comparison to this script.

The two lead characters are nothing but two spoiled, bratty bitches, while the Tanzie character only has the minute elements of being a semi good girl sort of character who is also slightly smarter than her very dim-witted sister, Ava. I never rooted for them and I never cared, even when their characters seemed to become smarter and learned how to be semi-normal people.

Even with cast members like Anjelica Huston and Brent Spiner (Who also appeared in another horrible comedy, The Master Of Disguise. Were things really so bad after they stopped making Star Trek films for awhile?), the script does absolutely nothing with them, outside of simple caricatures, being possible lame villains, or red herrings in the story's abominable insertion of mystery elements that makes even the most generic of mystery films look masterful by comparison.

It also has absolutely nothing insightful to say about rich people, high society, regular life, clearing one's name from a false accusation, or anything all together. It's all about following two air-headed tarts who aren't even funny or interesting air-headed tarts (I should have Romy And Michele's High School Reunion again instead. Now that was a funny film about air-headed tarts).

The acting is horrible across the board. As much as I disliked A Cinderella Story, in which Hilary Duff was the lead star, I felt that she gave a good performance in that film and showed signs of being far more capable than what that film would lead the viewer to believe. Unfortunately, that aura is definitely not present in this film. Here, Hilary Duff is just annoying, though at least she's more tolerable than her sister. I'm not sure what sort of acting abilities Haylie Duff might possess, but she was beyond bad in this film. Together, they're both just annoying tarts that began to grate on my nerves within less than two minutes of watching this abomination.

Anjelica Huston is shamefully wasted and her presence is practically nonexistent, though she is probably the best actress of the bunch by doing another bitchy sort of performance, which was mildly entertaining at times. No other cast members are worth noting, other than expressing sadness over seeing the decline of Brent Spiner's career.

Entertainment? What entertainment? This film is so hollow and vacant, that even viewers with the most minimum standards for chick flicks will be hard-pressed to find anything of value in this film. It has only the most shallow elements of storytelling, characters so one-dimensional they are one step away from just being cardboard cutouts, horrible and unfunny jokes, and horrible acting. There is nothing to derive from this film other than brief moments of Anjelica Huston's performance which can be momentarily entertaining to watch.

Humor? Are you fucking kidding me? For comedies I usually try to have an extra paragraph to dedicate to humor, but there is not one positive thing that I can say about the humor. There are no funny parts.

Material Girls is a horrible film that has only a single redeeming quality thanks only to Anjelica Huston's performance. Other than her, there is nothing of value to find, even if you have even the most shallow of standards for this type of film. Avoid it at all costs if you want to keep your sanity intact."

Fox plays an innocent lost to fhe woes of a cold, heartless world, something the heartless critics can identify with.

He comes alive once again as his angle reminds him of the passion he had once within. And it's in the saving that not only turns his world right side up but fully transforms the beauty of the inner angel to her fullest form.

1899,passion_play,audience,1.0,n,"The film strikes out, big time. It feels like the director was trying to make a David Lynch or Terry Gilliam type of movie here. He even tries copying their styles and it doesn't work. In a weird way the film kind of reminded me of the movie, Indecent Proposal.  The special effects weren't good here. The flying sequence and Megan Fox's wings looked too cheesy and fake.

There is a lot of miscasting here. I think they casted Rourke cause of Angel Heart. He was better in that film than this one. He has no on screen chemistry with Fox. Megan tries to do the best that she can on screen. Rhys Ifans is way over the top in his role. Bill Murray happens to be the best one here. He makes the film, watchable. I like when he plays villain roles, like in Mad Dog and Glory and Kingpin.

If you see this movie, then watch it for Bill Murray's performance."

Jamie Kennedy is supposed to be a comedian.  I don't think I laughed at all through this."
1955,kickin_it_old_school,audience,2.5,n,"I decided to give this a ""slightly"" better score than the audience score.  There were many things that failed tremendously with this movie.  I think the concept was a good one, but it failed from a massively poor execution.  For one thing, the directing must have been at fault.  There was a pretty good cast and an interesting array of talent involved.  I'm what you'd call a die-hard Jamie Kennedy fan.  He's miraculously talented, but he couldn't help save this movie from the ash heap of mostly idiocy that it was.  Notwithstanding my harsh criticisms, I got some great laughs at certain parts of this, and that's partly why I'm willing to give it a slightly better rating than most.  Still though, I'd have liked to seen a much better overall end product.  The editing might have saved this a little bit more, but I bet it was a rough job to meld this into a final cut for release.  It felt like a B movie with some very funny parts, and with some absolutely abysmal parts.  The script writing didn't really match the individual actors very well.  The jokes and the timing were off, or just not so good in many instances, with a few very good exceptions of course.  Again, the core concept was a good one, but the script writing and the directing seemed to misfire hard on this.  Never-mind though, because I'm a Jamie Kennedy fan fo-life.  Maria Menounos looked amazing and she pulled off a likable performance as Jennifer in this otherwise drought of entertainment.  At best, to some, this movie might take on a cult status with a few who find the charm in this as an epic movie failure.  None of this is intended to be a knock on Jamie Kennedy.  He's given me so many outrageous uncontrollable laughs throughout the years that I gotta give him mad props.  I wish this movie had also been a hit because it might have given a boost to the idea of Stu Stone and Jamie as a rap duo.  They put out a good record that deserved some great credit, but it will almost surely be forgotten.  It was worth a once over, but I doubt I'll ever take the time to watch this gain."

All John Derek did while directing Bolero is showing off his beautiful wife (Bo Derek). The plot and writing is just lazy, pathetic, idiotic, and pointless. Exactly one hour into this movie, Ayre (Bo Derek) got what she wanted yet we have to watch this trash for another forty minutes? Poor casting may I add. I mean come on. Bo Derek and Ana Obregón playing college students? There are a lot of nonsensical moments throughout the film like for example, Ayre jumped out of a plane (without a parachute) and survived...really? Idiotic writing at best. The acting was garbage as well. Bo Derek and Andrea Occhipinti were terrible. John Derek's directing is also awful. Especially since he thinks it's a good idea to have people do inappropriate scenes when they're not supposed to perform such scenes. That's just insane and idiotic. At the end of the day, Bolero is just awful. The directing is awful, the writing is awful, and the acting is awful. The entire movie is awful. Bolero should not even be considered a ""so bad it's good"" kind of movie."
1983,bolero_1984,audience,0.5,n,"The first time I saw the movie Bolero, I thought it was laughably incompetently awful. Now that I revisit the movie for this list, as well as scan through John Derek's filmography, I noticed one thing in common. All of his movies are schlocky low budget films about sexual fantasies or contrived romances usually starring his wife Bo Derek. Bolero is another entry, except it's about a college graduate Mac (Bo Derek) who's excited to travel around the world and lose her virginity to either a Moroccan sheik (Greg Benson) or a Spanish matador (Andrea Occhipinti). This movie is extravagantly well-known for its awkward sex scenes, overuse of extreme close-ups, horrific acting and even worse writing and direction from John Derek. The sheik's storyline is entirely useless and only serves as the comic foil who drops asleep during sex and is forgotten for the most part. Angel the bullfighter is reduced to this one-dimensional hot bod who Mac ends up marrying at the end. Bo Derek, even though she does have an attractive body, is even worse as she delivers her husband's dopey lines in that dorky plastered smile even during the most dangerous situations. Bolero is not a movie, but an excuse to incorporate a director's wife in soft-core porn. This isn't especially surprising considering Cannon Group's sleazy reputation.

Set in the 1920s, a young woman sets out to lose her virginity.   Her mission leads her to a Moroccan sheik and a Spanish bullfighter.

Very weak, to the point of laughable.  Very basic, stupid plot.  Dialogue is pretty silly too.  Performances are in keeping with the general superficiality of the movie.

It's really just a skinflick with delusions of being something more romantic and serious.  

One of many movies written and directed by John Derek where he just used his young (30 years his junior) wife, Bo Derek, as eye candy.  The other ones (Tarzan The Ape Man, Fantasies, Ghosts Can't Do It) have met with similar low regard.

Poor George Kennedy - he really deserved better."

Derek is a terrible actress who somehow manages to even ruin her nude scenes.  George Kennedy kind of classes up the joint.  Andrea Occhipinti stands around looking like Hugh Jackman.

Then she hightails it to Spain where she meets a hunky bullfighter, she finally gets laid and the bullfighter is injured for his troubles.

2012,strange_wilderness,audience,4.5,p,"I don't know what movie other people watched, but we found ""Strange Wilderness"" to be one of the funniest movies we've seen in a long time.  True, it's not droll British humor or humor likely to win any awards, but if you're in a sophomoric mood or have a few doobies under your belt, you can't beat it.  Steve Zahn's character reminds me of his performances in ""Saving Silverman"" and ""That Thing You Do.""  He's out to poke holes in other people being serious while trying to be serious himself at times.  The cast is stellar with appearances by Jonah Hill, Justin Long, Joe Don Baker, Harry Hamlin, Robert Patrick, and even Oscar-winner, Ernest Borgnine.  Yes...this looks like a movie that a bunch of guys put together on a napkin at a TGI-Fridays in one night, but it works.  They even make a joke referencing a part of the script that was put together that exact way.  Not sure where Jonah Hill was in his career when this came out, but, judging from his weight, I'd estimate sometime around ""Superbad"" but definitely long, long before ""Moneyball.""  Personally, I prefer the plumper version of Jonah as opposed to the slimmed-down version of late.  ""Strange Wilderness"" is about the son of a once-great naturalist broadcaster who is trying to carry on his dad's legacy on TV while ingesting lots of weed and coke.  Everyone around him shows signs of being in the same boat with nary a working brain cell to share among them.  I'm surprised no one took the concept of this movie and didn't try to make a direct to video nature show or a syndicated show like it.  Back in the 80s, there was a show where old movies were re-voiced by a group of comedians with hilarious results.  My favorite was when they re-voiced a Shirley Temple movie where her favorite doll was possessed by the devil who told her evil things to do to people around her.  Similar concept here:  the people on the show shoot real nature videos but their voice-overs make up facts that either are loosely true or flat out lies.  No matter.  They're hilariously funny either way.  If you don't believe me, call up the trailer on YouTube.  The movie is EXACTLY like the trailer.  If you don't like the trailer, you won't like the movie.  If you do like the trailer, you're going to love the movie."

So did I, and after watching this movie I feel like I owe everyone behind the Emoji Movie a heartfelt apology. 

Almost every character in this movie accept one is either void of personality, or so irritating that I want to shoot myself. There are extended dance numbers and monologues that do absolutely nothing to further the story whatsoever. And when I say extended, I mean it. Most of the jokes and gags are abysmal I can only cherry pick a couple of times where I actually laughed. The only reason  I give this movie one star instead of half a star is that I was truly astonished at how awful it was.

Is this what they wanted? Were the people behind this movie so brilliant that they created the single worst movie anyone has ever laid their eyes upon only so that suckers like me can get worked up and flock to rottentomatoes.com to vent our frustrations.

It's dull and repetitive, the lead's dynamic with this robo-alien thingy called Steel is nowhere near as entertaining as, to give an example, Venom & Eddie Brock, it's hard to get immersed in this world when it comes off as depressingly empty, I don't really care about the protagonist's daddy issues and the revelations and, most infamously, there's barely any action in this movie. Which, you know, tend to be the main selling point of a frickin' superhero movie, even in origin stories. Only one proper fight happens and that's near the end with minimal superheroics before that. No saving somebody from getting run over or the hero using some random criminal lowlifes as target practice, just stuff about a psychic connection while the actor screams and keeps telling his crush/girlfriend ""I'm sorry, I have to go"". I'd have hoped that Mattel's attempt to start their own toy-based movie franchise might have been raked over the coals hard by critics but sadly I have to agree that, if it weren't for it being immediately forgotten, lacking anything to help it stand out in a genre that, by the time this movie came out, was understandably being increasingly met with concerns that it would be in danger of getting oversaturated and dying a quiet death at the box office, it could easily have qualified as unequivocally one of the worst superhero movies of all time."

Director Stewart Hendler does the best he can with what he is given; a weak script and a measly $10 million budget. But he crafts a unique, fun origin story that's VERY pretty to look at with his wonderful color grading and cinematography coupled with some very creative sky replacements. 

If there was more faith in this movie and if Stewart Hendler had more resources, better people, and a budget the same size as your average DC or Marvel movie, I truly believe that he would have made the next Hollywood franchise-starter and added another unknown superhero to the public eye."

 A movie riddled with bizarre editing choices and dramatical theatrics that try to convey the ""seriousness"" of the movie's story but instead comes off as melodramatic and often times corny.  Frankie Muniz (Malcolm in the Middle) had no business being in this movie as his character served zero purpose to the central story.

The performances are exaggerated, lots of mimétisme and body language, it's a farce within the farce, a love letter to old school films done in studios with lavish photography, colors and costumes.

What is creepy about portraying something that you are not? There is nothing even remotely sexual in the movie, so that critique especially is really stupid.

2195,zoom_2006,audience,0.5,n,"Superheroes are usually meant for an older audience. But aiming for a much younger crowd, can be achieved, under the right circumstances. In fact, take a look at 2004's ""The Incredibles"", a superhero feature that caters to both adults and kids at the same time. Naturally, many other studios wanted to cash in on this type of success, and thus, Sony tried their hardest to make a superhero feature called ""Zoom"" in the year 2006. The key word being tried. Because, what ultimately happened was that this movie failed miserably, both at the box office, and with the critics. Is this statement true? Why, yes, yes it is. ""Zoom"" is an absolute failure from start to finish. From awful acting, poor pacing, and worst of all, a bad script that is based on a book, ""Zoom"" doesn't work in any kind of sense. There is nothing redeemable that makes it good; this is easily one of the worst superhero films of all time. Whatever Sony was thinking to turn this into a franchise, ""Zoom"" just wasn't it.

The story follows a group of kids that are recruited to a secret military base in order to become superheroes. These include two teenagers Dylan and Summer (Michael Cassidy and Kate Mara respectively), and two children Tucker and Cindy (Spencer Breslin and Ryan Newman respectively). Together, this quartet are being trained under the tutelage of a former superhero: Captain Zoom (Tim Allen). Unfortunately, Zoom doesn't want to do this, and wants to live his own life. As time eventually goes on, Zoom must find ways in order to make peace with these kids, as well as to be a part of a team once more. And in doing so, they must stop an old villain from Zoom's past before he breaks havoc onto the world once more.

""Zoom"" is a really bad film. And here's why.

The acting is awful. Not only just from Allen, who acts like he doesn't want to be here, but from all the other major players that are present in this production. In the movie, we also have access to bad performances from Rip Torn, Courtney Cox, and even Chevy Chase, just to name a few. The kid actors are all right, as are the teenage actors, but nobody turns out a decent performance, as they really don't seem to care whether or not they are here on the set or not.

This can contributed to the direction from Peter Hewitt. It feels like there is no sense of direction from him, as all the actors either do not care, or just do whatever they feel like. And this wasn't the first time Peter was behind the director's chair, but it nearly looks like this was going to be his last.

Next, we have the music. It's pretty much non-existent. What I mean by this is that while the main orchestrated score by Christophe Beck, it's mostly pushed over to the side by a pop soundtrack. Oh, and most of the songs in general are done by rock band Smash Mouth, because that worked so well with 2001's ""Shrek"". And even when the orchestration is being delivered, it's not that memorable. For instance, there should have been a lot more action pieces, but instead, we get more of a comedic tone delivered. What were they thinking?

The costumes and set design is also generic and boring. It's your typical lab coats and same matching outfits. Nothing really stands out.

But the biggest crime that the movie serves up is with its story and writing. The story combines a lot of other superhero origins from other narratives, i.e. X-Men and Fantastic Four for example, and it just doesn't work. There are a lot of plot holes, not a lot of character development, and overall, no major buildup to the final confrontation with the main villain. As for the writing,it's formulaic, predictable, and overall not funny. The main purpose of a comedy, is to be funny, but here, it feels like all of the humor is sucked out, and replaced with nothing.

The editing and pacing can be a real deal breaker here. At roughly 90 minutes, the film moves at rather fast pace, and there is no time for the movie to slow down or take a break. If the movie could have added a couple of extra minutes and taken its time, then we wouldn't have the mess that was produced. The editing plays a huge factor in this as well. Everything moves irregularly, and there are times when the editing just wants to do whatever it wants. That just makes this film even worse.

But the sad reality is that this could have worked. Something like could have worked out, and what we would have gotten, would be something good. Given the right direction and script, this would have turned out great.

But as it is, ""Zoom"" is a bad and terrible superhero film that tries is hardest to appeal to the younger demographic, yet ultimately earns its place in the bargain bin."

[originally posted 6Mar2000]

Lesson one: never let the only person at the table neither of you has ever met choose the movie you're going to see that night. Lesson two: ""dinner and a movie"" these days must, by necessity, have the movie first. You can't plan a dinner to finish just around the time that movies start unless you make it yourself.

Once upon a time there was a rapper and his DJ. The DJ had written a movie script, and the rapper wanted to to star in it. It came out about the same time as eighty-seven-and-a-half other movies starring rappers, and there wasn't really much to distinguish it save the presence of an up-and-coming comedian who later went on to superstardom. And I don't know whether Chris Tucker is the reason, or something else, but Friday--written by Pooh and starring Ice Cube-- became a cult hit. It's still almost impossible to rent, years later, and when it shows up on prime time television, it gets ratings good enough to put it in the top twenty or so for the week. This, of course, makes Pooh think ""hey, my movie must be better than the rest of them. Maybe I should try it again.""

In one month, Pooh has had two movies pop up-- Next Friday, the sequel to Friday, and Three Strikes. Everyone and their brother has already panned the former, so I don't need to add my own thoughts. But I haven't seen any reviews of Three Strikes yet. So I still get to chime in.

The story revolves around Robert Duncan (Brian Hooks), a two-time offender who gets out of prison and, thanks to a series of misadventures, finds himself in a shootout over a stolen car. Knowing that he's going to jail for good if the cops think he's involved in some way, he runs, and spends the rest of the movie on the run from the cops while trying to patch things up with his girfriend (N'Bushe Wright), avoid the friends of the car thief/shooter he left in the lurch, and calm his dysfunctional family. The usual misadventures occur that one sees in a movie such as this.

And that's the problem with this flick-- it's the usual, the usual, and more of the usual. Some funny stuff, because Pooh really is good at writing comedy, but for the most part a lot of talented comic castmembers fall flat. David Alan Grier, as the primary on the Duncan case, falls flat in almost every scene. Vincent Schiavelli is completely forgettable as Duncan's parole officer, and David Leisure doesn't have enough screen time to really get his shtick into gear. These performances balance out the good stuff-- Wright, Faison Love as the all-too-likable bad guy, and Duncan's deadpan sidekick, played by... uhhhhhh... IMDB isn't listing most of the players here. D'oh!

In any case, it might be worth a rental. If you're a DJ Pooh completist or just like staring at N'Bushe Wright. Otherwise, ignore it and let it slip into the well-deserved obscurity waiting for it. **"

2256,highlander_2_the_quickening,audience,0.5,n,There should have been only one.
2257,highlander_2_the_quickening,audience,2.5,n,"I saw the 2004 version, which apparently has updated special effects and is much more coherent and than the 1991 theatrical version. I went in fresh, not having seen the first Highlander, and unaware of this movie's reputation as one of the worst movies ever made (although I had somehow known through osmosis this movie isn't very highly regarded). I was pretty much lost during the first act, and I wasn't sure if that was due to having not seen the first movie, or if the narrative was genuinely confusing. Either way, a movie should orient you in the world and be able to stand on its own. I had trouble understanding the timeline, whether the Highlanders were from the past or some fantasy realm (turns out both), and what was the villain, Katana's, motivation. The world building was pretty flimsy as well. The Highlanders' world didn't feel lived-in, and the practicalities of living on an Earth without sunlight are hardly explored. Virginia Madsen's character grapples with the film's internal logic involving immortality, and her confusion basically mirrored mine. If the characters don't understand it, how can we the audience?

Having said that, I didn't think this was such a bad movie. I thought a lot of the shots were inventive, such as the wide shot of Katana walking through the Shield corporation's headquarters, and the rotating camera as Virginia Madsen climbed a spiral staircase. A shot of the city clearly involved heavy equipment to move the camera as this was made in the days before CGI. The premise and setting are at least creative, if underdeveloped. It is hard to hate a movie that is clearly trying, when there are plenty of other sequels that are cynical cash-grabs. Highlander II is basically a movie that tried and failed, which is probably why people find things to enjoy about it while marveling at its badness, while not exactly hating on it.

Although, about halfway through, I noticed an odd thing happening: I found myself being entertained by its over-the-top action and dialogue. Highlander II is an odd and confusing movie, but it is certainly not one of the worst movies ever made."
2258,highlander_2_the_quickening,audience,1.0,n,"After recently watching the first Highlander film (from 1986) and being filled with the Scottish spirit, I was excited to see where the series would go. I had heard from many sources that Highlander 2: The Quickening was a huge let down from the original and that it was, in fact, a horrible film. But I always brushed those comments aside because I usually enjoy a good, brainless, fun action film from the '80s and '90s. I didn't get my hopes up at all though since I saw the 0% score on Rotten Tomatoes but I thought maybe it might still be at least somewhat enjoyable. How wrong I was. Not only is this film terribly made from almost all perspectives, it's not even enjoyable to watch in the slightest. The film is filled to the brim with ""comedic"" scenes that just made the film seem overly stupid and the overall feel of these little scenes did not work well at all with anything else in the film. It even makes the film seem a little cliche and out of date today since many of the later '90s action flicks also incorporated this awful, non-fitting, non-funny, off-beat comedic relief such as Judge Dredd in '95 and Demolition Man in '93 among others. The movie's biggest problem though is its infamous multiple plotlines that barely go together at all, most of which are just forgotten and never resolved or mentioned again, almost as if the only purpose of starting that plotline was to get a fight scene or a ""funny"" moment that just throws the pace of the film off. But, these multiple plotlines don't just make the film nearly 2 hours, they make the film incomprehensible. Nothing makes sense in this film, and while there are many things that don't make sense in the '86 film, at least that one resolved its plotlines and had a unique charm, which I will get to later. Sean Connery's character was completely decapitated in the first film just to pop up randomly in this one without any explanation. The entire time travel plotline was completely ripped from Cameron's '84 masterpiece The Terminator down to the imagery and shot framing that was used. The terrible plotlines also lead to many consistency errors that would take all day to list. The plotlines just make a massive blob and mess of a film that clearly was just a bunch of people throwing whatever ideas first came to mind into the script. The main plotline isn't even interesting or intriguing at all (this is the ridiculous ozone layer plotline for those who can't tell due to the hundreds of plotlines in this film). I just felt that with all these plots, there was so much that could have been cut out to shorten the runtime and just make the film easier to follow and more enjoyable to watch. I kept catching myself saying ""that could be cut out"" which doesn't lead to a good film. Some smaller problems with the film would be that in some scenes the music didn't fit at all, especially the runaway train scene. The set was very generic-looking for an '80s-'90s sci-fi dystopian film and compared to some others, like '90's Total Recall, looks bland and boring. The costumes were also very bulky and ridiculous and I would expect that from a film like this from this time but this was especially bad. Some of the editing was also very awkward and terribly structured. There were way too many cuts in certain scenes, specifically the runaway train scene, and in some of the fighting sequences the actors were out of frame preventing the audience from seeing the action. Also, there were way too many explosions. There seemed to be an explosion every two seconds and it just got very boring and annoying after a while. What makes this film especially bad is that it takes many of the mysterious things that made the '86 movie charming and interesting and just completely abuses them and takes their charm away. Another thing this movie lacks is the charm of the original. I missed the chemistry between Connery and Lambert, the bagpipe music (which makes an appearance in this film [The Quickening] and is, as said above, misused and doesn't fit entirely aside from reminding us of the good cinematography and images of Scotland in the '86 movie), the cinematography which was quite impressive for an '80s action film I must say, and just everything that made the first installment fun, interesting, and memorable. The acting was also not good especially from Ironside who seemed to be trying really hard to be an over-the-top Jack Nicholson (failing miserably, sadly). Lambert was ok in this film, he gives a much better performance in the '86 one and so does Connery. Connery was one of the few things I liked about this movie, he really did bring the mood up and the few scenes he shared with Lambert (and the suit tailoring scene) were fun and memorable, but other than that he seems to be completely wasted in this movie. The only other positive thing I have to say about this film is that in the opening sequence there was some good camera movement, sweeping across the opera house but again, it just seemed to drag on and extend the runtime. In a word, the best and shortest way to describe the horrendous waste of time that is Highlander 2: The Quickening is... messy."
2259,highlander_2_the_quickening,audience,0.5,n,"Wanted to see how bad it was, sufficet to say - it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen to the point not even 30 minutes in I stopped watching, they bring back dead characters? They should have not made a second movie, and left the original as a stand-alone."
2260,highlander_2_the_quickening,audience,1.5,n,"Highlander 2: The Quickening is a name so ridiculous that it serves as a perfect metaphor for the film itself. I seen the original not so long ago, and while I wasn't blown away by it, I still found myself engaging with its characters and enjoying its occasionally wacky storyline. The follow up seems to go out of its way to ruin anything good about its predecessor, and forever taint whatever legacy it had. It starts off by retconning the origin of the Immortals, then reverses the ending of the first film, then introduces some corporate espionage plotline that feels like it was lifted from another terrible sci-fi flick and carelessly dropped into this one. The story is a spectacular mess, the characters have unconvincing motivations, the script is lazy and the acting ranges from bored Hayden Christensen to sugar rush Nicholas Cage. The film is so confused and disordered that every 20 minutes could well have been written and directed by a different person. The villains were my favourite element by far. Not because they're compelling or intimidating, but because of the sheer volume of scenery they get to chew. Michael Ironside, who know from the start that the movie was going to suck, takes every opportunity to bare his shiny teeth and mug to the camera, and I was laughing throughout pretty much all of his scenes. He's cartoonish to the extreme, and John C. McGinley, doing a weak Orson Welles impression, is not quite as silly, but occasionally gets pretty close. I can't say I was bored while watching it, and the movie does pass by very quickly, possibly because of how baffled I was by it all. At the end of the day, there's much, much worse out there, but it's still a film that nobody really wanted to be in, especially when it was re-written, and it's long been confined to the ‘worst movies of all time' pile, where it more than deserves to be. If you're a ‘so bad its good' afficionado, Highlander 2: The Quickening is an absolute must see."

2317,bless_the_child,audience,0.5,n,Im not down For this religious shit
2318,bless_the_child,audience,1.0,n,Silly and not scary.  Barely tolerable in the background while doing something else.
2319,bless_the_child,audience,5.0,p,I love this movie. I've watched it a hundred times.
2320,bless_the_child,audience,0.5,n,Lost interest halfway through this movie and that seems too long.
2321,bless_the_child,audience,1.0,n,"It's kind of like the anti-Omen. This movie is so ridiculously hokey that you spend most of your time rolling your eyes. The few little bits of enjoyment you get are from laughing at the terrible acting and script. This movie is boring and forgettable. So forgettable in fact that I had forgotten I had even watched it... LAST NIGHT! There isn't a single thing I can say positive about this movie. I remembered liking it when it came out in theaters, that's why I re-watched it, but this was just bad."
2322,down_to_you,critics,rotten,n,"Not in any way a harmful or distasteful film, however clumsy it might be, Down to You is simply entirely forgettable."
2323,down_to_you,critics,rotten,n,It's like watching the dreckiest of teen puppy courtships trying to pass itself off as 'Annie Hall.
2324,down_to_you,critics,rotten,n,Weak and often inappropriate romantic comedy.
2325,down_to_you,critics,rotten,n,Both Julia Stiles and Freddie Prinze Jr. deserve better.
2326,down_to_you,critics,rotten,n,"It's all reasonably pleasant to watch, but Isacsson doesn't seem to know what to do with the story once Al and Imogen fall in love."
2327,down_to_you,critics,rotten,n,[A] relentlessly adolescent romantic comedy.
2328,down_to_you,critics,rotten,n,
2329,down_to_you,critics,rotten,n,Al (Prinze) and Imogen (Stiles) are 19-year-olds tackling New York college life. The course of their relationship is charted in numbing detail and interspersed with the antics of their quirky friends.
2330,down_to_you,critics,rotten,n,"It's hard to determine exactly where I gave up on Down to You, but I'm pretty sure it was right after the opening credits."
2331,down_to_you,critics,rotten,n,"[Director Kris Isacsson] tries to bring a little enterprise to the inevitable scenes of bickering and moody silence, but by now the vitalising tactics seem out of place."
2332,down_to_you,critics,rotten,n,"Julia Stiles is fetching, but no surprises rain on the limpid parade of familiar post-adolescent love."
2333,down_to_you,critics,rotten,n,"a mostly bitter, sometimes downright grim fairy tale in which Cinderella becomes a stoner and Prince Charming winds up getting his stomach pumped."
2334,down_to_you,critics,rotten,n,"When the lovers finally do find a reason to fight, the film takes a turn into hand-wringing melodrama from which it never recovers."
2335,down_to_you,critics,rotten,n,"Belongs to that other kind of American teen comedy... movies of crushes and wagers and sex jokes, with patchwork plots and a standby army of eccentric comic sidekicks."
2336,down_to_you,critics,rotten,n,"The script, which simply doesn't work at all, and reduces the characters to lumpen, uninteresting blobs, despite the handsome cast."
2337,down_to_you,critics,rotten,n,A disappointment.
2338,down_to_you,critics,rotten,n,Aimless and weird- like looking at a beautiful two dimensional picture postcard - but from the edge.
2339,down_to_you,critics,rotten,n,"Cinta con severas deficiencias y falta de ingredientes, siendo el principal de ellos la falta de corazn"
2340,down_to_you,critics,rotten,n,In the great tradition of silly kids flicks -- the ones that are easier to dance to than get into.
2341,down_to_you,critics,rotten,n,"Somewhere in all of that, there is a sweet story about two college kids who fall in love and find more than they are able to handle."
2342,down_to_you,audience,5.0,p,This is one of my favorite movies! It's relatable in many ways and silly. Every time I watch it my emotions run with it.
2343,down_to_you,audience,0.5,n,"Don't come ""Down to You"" for a movie that's both worthy of the Burnin' Medallion Of Badness and forgettable. Characters: 0/5 Story: 0/5 Acting: 0.5/5 Direction: 0.5/5 Cinematography: 0/5 Soundtrack: 0/5 Overall: 0.5/5"
2344,down_to_you,audience,3.0,p,The script is hit or miss but the cast is a blast and make it entertaining.
2345,down_to_you,audience,5.0,p,"As a 21 year old, this was relatable. Cried twice. I loved it."
2346,down_to_you,audience,0.5,n,Bland.. cringy.... lazy
2347,down_to_you,audience,0.5,n,"I literallly think this is the most absolute garbage of an excuse for a film. What the hell were you thinking when making this? That is not ok. How do you treat people like that, that was torture. Do better. Don't watch."
2348,down_to_you,audience,3.0,p,Cute romantic comedy
2349,down_to_you,audience,3.0,p,Storyline was awful but I super love Julia Stiles
2350,down_to_you,audience,2.5,n,"Not original, and not much done to it to put a different spin on it. I did fall asleep during this, because I was tired, because I was watching it very late, but I think this could have some re-watch value, and get better on each viewing. Not very funny either. Also some really bad things written in that resulted in those parts being poorly performed. It's not Freddie Prinze Jr's best movie, either. But, it's not like, completely awful. I'm not surprised it has a three percent, though, even though if I don't completely agree with it."
2351,down_to_you,audience,3.0,p,It wasn't bad. But it wasn't great either. The acting was mostly ok but the dialogues seemed kind of... wrong. One thing that stayed with me is the unusual path the story-telling followed
2352,because_i_said_so,critics,rotten,n,Never met a cliché it didn't love or a situation too hackneyed to be inserted into the mix.
2353,because_i_said_so,critics,rotten,n,"I really wanted to like Because I Said So, but ultimately I just felt pity for it."
2354,because_i_said_so,critics,rotten,n,"In the end, while the mixture looks sweet, it goes down decidedly sour."
2355,because_i_said_so,critics,rotten,n,"This movie manages to be offensive and yet dull and predictable, as phony as a Kate Spade sidewalk knock-off bag and as unoriginal as the ready-for VH1 soundtrack."
2356,because_i_said_so,critics,rotten,n,"Because I Said So seems like it's supposed to be a paean of sorts to motherhood and the enduring love that entails, a love so strong that it inevitably drives its possessor somewhat batty. But what it is, is muddled crap."
2357,because_i_said_so,critics,rotten,n,Like steel pins poking through the eyes
2358,because_i_said_so,critics,rotten,n,The ensuing cycle of miscommunication is endless and trying.
2359,because_i_said_so,critics,rotten,n,There are chick flicks and upchuck flicks. The movie Because I Said So is an upchuck chick flick.
2360,because_i_said_so,critics,rotten,n,"This is a by-the-book chick flick we're talking about, but the writers and director apparently didn't want to push the envelope when it came to the supporting characters -- or the main characters."
2361,because_i_said_so,critics,rotten,n,"Because I Said So isn't very funny, and no amount of having Diane Keaton act all post-menopausally zany is going to create the tension that just isn't there."
2362,because_i_said_so,critics,rotten,n,"A veteran of classic films such as Annie Hall and The Godfather, Diane Keaton should have known better than to sign up for this kind of light and fluffy schmaltz, even if the director promised she would look great in her underwear."
2363,because_i_said_so,critics,rotten,n,Matricide.
2364,because_i_said_so,critics,rotten,n,It's a lame duck of a film.
2365,because_i_said_so,critics,rotten,n,"A light-weight comedy about mothers and daughters, Because I Said So is a bit like the chocolate soufflés that Mandy Moore's Milly cooks throughout. It's light and fluffy, but on occasions it does not rise to the occasion"
2366,because_i_said_so,critics,rotten,n,each character in the film is so shallow and cold that there's nobody for the audience to cheer on.
2367,because_i_said_so,critics,rotten,n,There's more than enough material here to make an enjoyable drama about a mother and her adult daughters. But the writers and director fail on virtually every front.
2368,because_i_said_so,critics,rotten,n,"I don't think anyone actually wrote Because I Said So; I think that some Hollywood artificial intelligence think-tank instead fed DVD box sets of The Gilmore Girls and Sex and the City into a computer, along with Pottery Barn catalogs for roughage. ..."
2369,because_i_said_so,critics,rotten,n,"At 61, Diane Keaton is still doing her ditzy, girlish thing, but the act is getting a little oppressive and rarely more so than in Because I Said So, an indulgent comedy."
2370,because_i_said_so,critics,rotten,n,[A] better movie might have surfaced if everyone had taken their Ritalin and calmed down.
2371,because_i_said_so,critics,rotten,n,I hated this movie. I think it's the worst performance of Diane Keaton's career.
2372,because_i_said_so,audience,3.5,p,"Had to write something because this piece was on the ""worst 100"" list and it shouldn't be. I cared, I laughed, I believed the characters. It's not a cure for cancer, it's a rom com and a good one. Really fun characters and situations and cake."
2373,because_i_said_so,audience,3.0,p,"Some cute elements and good performances, but stalker mom was not one of them."
2374,because_i_said_so,audience,0.5,n,Wow. So bad words can’t describe it. Absolutely brutal.
2375,because_i_said_so,audience,1.0,n,I love Diane Keaton but movie was a total fail. Boring at best.
2376,because_i_said_so,audience,5.0,p,"Funny, silly and lighthearted! If you're looking for a cute romantic comedy to watch & drink some wine and relax to.... watch it!!!! This movie is underrated! Rotten tomatoes 4%!!!!! Crazy! The Critics' comments on this movie are Waaay too harsh! Decide for yourself! Don't go off of what the critics say!"
2377,because_i_said_so,audience,1.5,n,What is this crappy mess!?!?
2378,because_i_said_so,audience,5.0,p,I really like the energy between the sister and how they know each other so we'll. I also love the romance in Mandy Moore and Gabriel Macht. He is to die for!
2379,because_i_said_so,audience,5.0,p,"Great cast. Dramatic, funny, realistic, romantic and heartbreaking storyline. I love this movie"
2380,because_i_said_so,audience,5.0,p,Can't believe so many people hate this movie. I'll watch anything Diane Keaton is in she's such a great actress.
2381,because_i_said_so,audience,0.5,n,"So bad, I created a rotten tomato account just to give it a bad score."
